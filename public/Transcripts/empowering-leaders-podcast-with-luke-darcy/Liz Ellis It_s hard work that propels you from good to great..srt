00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:08,480
This episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast features a legend of Australian sport, Liz Ellis.

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,839
Very lucky to call Liz a friend.

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,679
And we talk about the month that we spent in Delhi, India in 2010 working together on the Commonwealth Games.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,320
And how she threw me right under the bus by handing me a phone when I was standing at the bar

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,039
that put me live on air in Melbourne radio that just about cost me my job.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:33,219
Liz also shares her story and her journey from being hyper-competitive to learning to be a person

7
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,200
and her words that describes just being able to stop and be.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,399
She also shares her fight and the instinct she had to constantly try and succeed

9
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,820
as she's done in almost everything in her life when really struggling to conceive her second child.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,780
She talks with me about the language we can use to have better conversations around fertility and miscarriage.

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,060
And there's a link to her book, If At First You Don't Conceive, in the show notes that's worth checking out.

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,939
We also talk about the lessons she learned when she bought into an ice cream business that ended up failing

13
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,060
and she reminded me of an amazing quote about

14
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,040
never being able to succeed without taking risks.

15
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,819
I hope you enjoy this conversation and laugh as much as I did catching up with the great Liz Ellis.

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,219
It's people like Liz that inspire the work we do at Alita.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,519
We are really privileged to have Liz Ellis in our Alita Connect group

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,680
and I love the diversity of thinking in her group.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,180
Paul Watterson from Australian Venue Co, Brad Johnson from the Bulldogs,

20
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,959
Brendan Lader, Premiership AFL player and Dylan Flavel as well.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,519
Diversity of thinking and Liz is an incredible contributor and thinker in that world of Alita Connect.

22
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:32,700
Thank you.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:32,760
Thank you.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:32,780
Thank you.

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,799
Thank you.

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:32,819
Thank you.

27
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:32,840
Thank you.

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:32,859
Thank you.

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:32,920
Thank you.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,200
Thank you.

31
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,799

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,459
We curate groups of five or six like the one Liz Ellis is in and you don't have to be an Australian legend like Liz to join our world.

33
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,299
We'd love to connect with you and start your leadership journey today.

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,799
Huge thanks as always to the team at Temper Bedding.

35
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,340
Jason Nicholas and his team are great supporters of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,120
We really appreciate them supporting conversations like this one with Liz Ellis.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,420
We know that great successful people value sleep.

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,859
A third of your life is spent on a mattress.

39
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,200
You may as well invest.

40
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,599
You may as well invest in the world's best bedding.

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,379
That is Temper.

42
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,019
It's a mattress like no other.

43
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,020
It'll change your life.

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,330
Liz Ellis is one of the most respected names in Australian sport.

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,349
A remarkable 18-year elite netball career that included two Commonwealth Games gold medals,

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,530
three world championships, four National League titles, four MVP awards, and an Australian

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,990
record 122 test matches played.

48
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,370
In 2018, Liz became an Officer of the Order of Australia for her distinguished service

49
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,949
to netball.

50
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:41,710
As an elite player and coach, through support and advocacy for young women as a contributor

51
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,830
to the broadcast and print media industries and to the community, Liz is a lawyer by trade,

52
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,469
experienced broadcaster, media personality, host, and the most recent winner of Australia's

53
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,389
version of I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, which is incredible, Liz.

54
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,629
She's also a very sought-after board director holding positions on the Australian Sports

55
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,449
Commission, the Sydney Olympic Park Authority, and the New South Wales Institute of Sport.

56
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:05,930
Liz, it's all right.

57
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,590
It's always good to see you.

58
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,530
Oh, thanks, Luke.

59
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,909
And you too.

60
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,710
What you didn't put in there was that, you know, I couldn't have done my netball commentary

61
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,710
career without having Elle Darcy holding my hand at the start.

62
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,469
Well, I'm sure we're going to get to that because that was a very enjoyable chapter

63
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:23,370
of, well, maybe let's start there because I thoroughly enjoyed that time.

64
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,330
I do remember getting the call from Channel 10 saying, we'd like you to host the netball.

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,449
And I was like, no fucking way in the world.

66
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm not equipped to do that.

67
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,789
That's the worst idea I've ever had.

68
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,569
And then I stand next to you and I couldn't have had more fun for two years, mainly because

69
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:39,930
of you.

70
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,810
Oh, thanks, Luke.

71
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:41,889
It was heaps of fun.

72
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,409
And what I loved about it was that you were so nervous, but you went away and you did

73
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,689
your work and you took it on.

74
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,289
And when I, since like, since then, and you've gone on with all your other media stuff, you

75
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,710
can sort of, like, I do feel a little bit of pride in you because I'm like, oh my God,

76
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,650
when you started, that's where you learn how to do ball by ball commentary.

77
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,090
And then you go in and do it with football and you're so good at it.

78
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,830
So, but those two years were funny.

79
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,590
And like stuff that we can't talk about with a microphone on, funny and just naughty.

80
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,509
And it was so enjoyable.

81
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,350
Well, you made me feel relaxed straight away because you're doing a sport you know nothing

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,790
about.

83
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,649
And it's the people that love that sport must be looking going, who is this boy?

84
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,149
Why is he standing there?

85
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,589
But standing next to you immediately gave me some maybe small credibility because you

86
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,350
embraced me straight away.

87
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,829
And I always talk about going to Delhi with you and that gold medal match in 2012.

88
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,730
That is still close to the best sporting event I've ever been to.

89
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,649
Double extra time.

90
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,350
And your reaction post that game, I'll never, ever forget.

91
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,750
You were so filthy Australia lost.

92
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,550
You couldn't hide it.

93
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,790
You refused to cooperate.

94
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,089
It was just extraordinary.

95
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,790
If they hold on, it's going to be gold.

96
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,509
No, no, Gerard, the man's broken.

97
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,350
There is 15 seconds left, Gerard.

98
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,170
It's a throw in.

99
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:04,629
So, McMahon.

100
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,350
Unbroke.

101
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:06,769
Turnover to New Zealand.

102
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,889
Long ball goes to Van Dijk.

103
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,800
He will go the way of Van Dijk.

104
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,500
This is phenomenal.

105
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,639
Should this go in, we will go straight into extra time.

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,519
To Taish.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Missed the last one.

108
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,480
This to draw level and go into double extra time.

109
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,740
We're waiting for a signal from our time kickers here.

110
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,279
It's 58 all.

111
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
If we get the call, the flag's up.

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,459
We're in double extra time.

113
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,800
Now we need, or the winner will be the first team to get up by two goals.

114
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,439
So, you're looking to score, but you're looking to break.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,579
Can you believe it?

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,040
Double extra time here.

117
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,279
The final gold medal.

118
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,879
Oh, it's a turnover.

119
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,329
It was amazing.

120
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,829
And, you know, I just couldn't believe that Australia had lost a game that they should have won.

121
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,370
And, you know, I'd been in Commonwealth Games finals in a double overtime final where we won.

122
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,569
So, to see players who I was still really close to not get up and win, it hurt me.

123
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,029
Thank God you were there.

124
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,629
But that was amazing, wasn't it?

125
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,910
That whole Delhi experience.

126
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,209
And, like, I look back at it now and I just laugh because it was one of the greatest sporting moments of all time.

127
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:25,990
It was in a stadium in Delhi and we were surrounded by army guys with machine guns who our security people from Channel 10, they were just so worried.

128
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,310
They were like, oh, my God, their gun security is not good.

129
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,889
We were like, oh, I don't know what's worse.

130
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,930
And, you know, and they used to, remember they used to man the security?

131
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,050
And you know how we used to have to go in and you had makeup in your bag?

132
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,649
And they'd pull the makeup out.

133
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,889
And they'd pull the makeup out every day and laugh at you.

134
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,850
And you had to explain that it was for television.

135
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,689
It was just so much funny stuff.

136
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,129
And then you get this amazing game of netball.

137
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,810
And remember we went away and I always talk to people about this, about preparation.

138
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,889
You know, I think that was, we did a really good job of calling that game.

139
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,610
But we sat down the night before and went through, okay, what would happen if it was overtime?

140
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,310
How would we know if it was double overtime?

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,449
Because it's not a hooter or anything that goes for double overtime.

142
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,350
So, when it happened, it was like, wow, we prepared for this to sound really natural.

143
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,790
And that to me is part of the success of the call is that you think ahead about what might

144
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,790
happen and how it might sound.

145
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,550
There's so many stories from that very fun and memorable trip.

146
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,889
We had a month in Delhi, which I love, but because of security, they'd shut down the

147
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:24,810
stadiums at the start.

148
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,370
So, we would be out at that venue for the whole day and starving by the end of the day

149
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,350
and going, are you prepared to eat the non-vegetarian shish kebab, Liz?

150
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,990
Because if you do, I reckon that could be interesting for you.

151
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,350
And I, as we walked into the studio, really,

152
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:44,509
Rosie, who I worked with for 11 years doing Breakfast Radio, reminded me of a moment where

153
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,550
you put me in, and I deserved it because I'd been allowed to go and commentate on the basis

154
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,889
that I would dial in to Breakfast Radio.

155
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,990
And I decided that I was going to have a few beers this particular night.

156
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,810
And I said, oh, look, I can't make it.

157
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,790
I'm otherwise occupied.

158
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,410
I'm snowed under over here.

159
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,410
So, they rang you.

160
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:05,430
They did.

161
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:06,430
And what did you do?

162
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,050
I was happy to talk.

163
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,269
I was like, yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:09,629
And they said, oh, yeah.

165
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,389
And I said, oh, look, how's Das?

166
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:11,930
Is he all right?

167
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,649
He sounds like he's really busy.

168
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,750
And I was outside the bar, and I'm like, no, he's just here.

169
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,709
Das, there's a phone call for you.

170
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,670
I might have had a couple at the time.

171
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,870
As you can imagine, that conversation is just outstanding.

172
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,470
You just couldn't believe that I was handing you the phone.

173
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,950
I think there may be audio of that, which we'll try and find.

174
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,429
Oh, look, I've ditched Luke.

175
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,830
And it's good to hear that you've ditched Luke from the show, actually.

176
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,350
I'm seeing.

177
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,149
I'm looking on the other side of the bar from him, and he's telling lies to someone.

178
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,929
So, it's good that I'm here, and I can tell you the truth.

179
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,090
A couple of things.

180
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:47,029
Now, he is a monkey.

181
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,950
So, a few days ago, we actually have to go into the netball together.

182
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,929
And every time we go through the security sort of area, they confiscate something of ours.

183
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,870
So, I always get my hand wash confiscated.

184
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,389
The other day, I got my makeup confiscated.

185
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:01,950
Oh, no.

186
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,450
Luke has as much makeup as me.

187
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,169
Didn't confiscate his makeup because they were too busy killing themselves laughing

188
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,230
at a man carrying that much makeup.

189
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,850
So, please feel free to ask him how his makeup is going.

190
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,570
And he needs as much makeup as he can because he's the most palest man on television.

191
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,250
But yesterday, a BBC cameraman was waving his arms around at the IBC and wasn't being

192
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,769
allowed in.

193
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,990
Made a mistake of waving a little bit too hard.

194
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,289
Got mistaken as a monkey mating ritual, and he got attacked by a monkey.

195
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,730
That was nearly a game changer for me on a whole range of issues.

196
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,009
Now, Liz, going back to the start, I look at you, and I think,

197
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,230
everything you do becomes successful.

198
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,529
And I'm not surprised, you know, that you win.

199
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,409
You tell me you're going on, I'm a celebrity.

200
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,429
Of course, you're going to win it.

201
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,970
But what are the traits, do you think, that have helped you to be successful in what you've done?

202
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,029
Oh, that's a good question.

203
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,710
I think when I look back at, like, me as a little kid, I was never the most talented,

204
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:01,330
and I was never, you know, had the most skill.

205
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,889
But I was always the hardest worker in my junior teams.

206
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,769
I always worked harder.

207
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:06,990
I always did the fitness.

208
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,309
I always made sure that I could.

209
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:08,950
If I wasn't.

210
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,269
If I wasn't the fittest, I could keep up and do enough.

211
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,610
I used to work hard on my skills, and I never, ever felt that I was the chosen one.

212
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,950
You know, like, you know, coming through juniors, there's always someone who's really outstanding

213
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,330
and awesome, and that was never me.

214
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,750
It was always somebody else.

215
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:25,169
So I was quite happy just to sit at that next level.

216
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,309
Well, I wasn't happy about it, and I wanted to be the chosen one.

217
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,710
So I'd go away and work really hard and harder than anyone else.

218
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,370
And then it's kind of you to say that everything I touch is successful.

219
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,549
I just don't talk about the stuff that's not successful.

220
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,669
I keep that nice and sort of on the down low.

221
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,950
You know, every time something does fail, I really try and look at it and try and figure

222
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,509
out why.

223
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,710
What did I do wrong?

224
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,549
What could I do better?

225
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,549
And that really then informs the hard work to become successful next time.

226
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,129
So, you know, you talk about those four premierships that we won.

227
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,850
They were all late in my career.

228
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,190
Early on in my career, we were pretty average as a team.

229
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,490
And one day we got in the bus and we'd been flogged.

230
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,350
And we said to our coach, yeah, we're not very good, but we're the funniest.

231
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,990
You would remember Julie Fitzgerald.

232
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,129
She was coaching when we were commentating and she just went off ahead of us.

233
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,509
And she really made us understand that that's just not acceptable.

234
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,470
Like, yeah, have fun by all means.

235
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,929
But what comes first is what you're here to do.

236
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,110
So I always have felt that I'm always, I'm prepared to work harder than anyone else.

237
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,450
And then you get into a situation like I'm a celebrity, which I never, I was always,

238
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,669
I'm never going to do reality TV ever, ever.

239
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:32,669
Anyway, I needed the money.

240
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,370
So I did it.

241
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,809
And, you know, I just thought I'll have to go in there.

242
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:38,649
And you can't.

243
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,690
You're in front of cameras 24 seven.

244
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,389
You can't hide.

245
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,490
And this is the other key I think to success is to not try and be someone that you're not.

246
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:50,049
I've never tried to be, um, any different to what I am.

247
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,549
What you see on camera is what you get off camera.

248
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,350
And sometimes that's, um, that's great.

249
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,929
Sometimes it's really annoying as you will be able to attest.

250
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,649
And the thing that really drives all of that is I'm an inherently awfully competitive person.

251
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,830
As you know, I hate to lose.

252
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,629
I still can't.

253
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,909
I still can't believe that I lost to you in the celebrity match.

254
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,929
You were genuinely filthy about that.

255
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm not a good loser.

256
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,529
And, you know, I've always said that show me a good loser and I'll show you someone I don't

257
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,409
want on my team, which is not very PC, but I'm really competitive, but that competitive,

258
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:29,470
that competitiveness has to be backed up with, with hard work and the preparedness to work

259
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,350
harder than anyone else.

260
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,350
And you mentioned that a night before the Commonwealth games, gold medal, it was you

261
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,210
sitting down, Hey, come and catch up.

262
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,210
These are the scenarios to play.

263
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,610
And you were the one with the detail on the preparation at a, at another level.

264
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,070
I like to do my homework, but that doesn't surprise me.

265
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:47,389
But there's a couple of things to pick up, pick up on.

266
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,649
I read your mum and dad described you as a bit of a clumsy kid.

267
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,730
You're a bit of a, a bit of a bookworm.

268
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,629
Is that, is that right?

269
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:54,389
That's so true.

270
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,690
So, um, I really only started playing netball by accident.

271
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,090
One of mum's friends rang her and said, and her name was Sheila, because all netball women

272
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,389
have great names like Sheila.

273
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:07,309
And I get up and thank Sheila every morning for my life because she rang mum and said,

274
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:08,610
would Liz like to play netball?

275
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,669
And mum said, no, she's a bit clumsy.

276
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:11,789
She's a bit of a bookworm.

277
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,470
I don't think team sports for her.

278
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,769
Sheila rang back about a week later and said, Margaret, you won't believe it.

279
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,429
I've just read that 95% of kids who end up as juvenile delinquents have never played

280
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:21,950
team sports.

281
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,470
So mum was hooked after that.

282
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,850
She was like, okay, well, Liz can play or Elizabeth, as I used to get called then, can

283
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,389
play on the proviso that when she wants to stop, she can.

284
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,309
So it took me 27 years to stop, but that was a really good lesson to reflect on.

285
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,789
I didn't understand it at the time because I was eight.

286
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:43,850
But now when I look back at that, I think so often we get told no and we go, okay.

287
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,669
But what Sheila taught me was that that no is just like the initial salvo.

288
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,409
It's actually, when you hear no, don't accept no, go out and find a way to get back to yes.

289
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,389
Now I've got no idea if she had read anything like that or if that was a spiel that she

290
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,070
gave to every parent who said no to her because she was a housewife in Western Sydney with

291
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,490
five kids and you wouldn't have looked at her and gone.

292
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,309
And she's a leader, but she's responsible for a whole generation of kids playing netball

293
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:12,870
and rugby league.

294
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:13,929
That's what her kids played.

295
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:16,250
And she thought that every kid should play team sport.

296
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,730
And that was how she went and got kids by guilting their parents and thinking they were

297
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,889
going to be juvenile delinquents.

298
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,389
So it was just luck.

299
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,990
And like I say, I do often sit down and I think about her because I think if she hadn't

300
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,090
have made that phone call, I would have gone on to achieve academically and do all that

301
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,590
sort of stuff.

302
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,889
And, you know, you mentioned I've got a law degree and I probably would be working in

303
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:37,470
a legal firm.

304
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,370
But I wouldn't have all the joy that my sport has brought me and I wouldn't have the

305
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,309
opportunity to do so many other things.

306
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:45,950
What a legend Sheila is.

307
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:46,509
What about mum?

308
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:47,169
Not for Liz.

309
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,129
She's reading her book and we'll keep her there.

310
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:55,669
You mentioned the law degree and I look at you and I think you're a constant improver,

311
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,870
constantly wanting to do something to better yourself.

312
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,690
So you do a law degree at the same time as playing sport for a living.

313
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,169
You take on a lot.

314
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,549
Is that true of you?

315
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,289
The constant never ending self-improver?

316
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:06,629
Yeah.

317
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:07,610
Which is good and bad.

318
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:13,889
Now I've got kids and, you know, we live in the country and my husband is often saying

319
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,370
to me, just stop, just slow down.

320
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,909
And sometimes I have to force myself to slow down so I can be present with the kids.

321
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,070
I'm not, I think my whole mindset is, okay, I'm always thinking of the next thing and

322
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,830
whether that's improving or whether that's planning a holiday or what I need to do in

323
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,250
the garden.

324
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,269
But I really do have to work hard to be mindful.

325
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,649
So there is a balance there.

326
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,450
It's great to wanting to continually improve and look for the next challenge.

327
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,909
But as you get older, particularly, and now my kids are young, they're 12 and seven.

328
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,509
I started a bit later than you, Dars.

329
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,850
I used to laugh at you with your 300 children having to get up early and get flights back

330
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,110
home.

331
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,809
I remember it.

332
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,409
Because now I'm like, no, that's me.

333
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,289
I'm on a 6.30 flight out of Melbourne on Sunday morning so I can get home and be with Matthew

334
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:55,750
and the kids.

335
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,350
So, but I think it's like wanting to improve yourself and looking for challenges is, I

336
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,149
think it's a really good trait, but it does need to be balanced by the ability to stop

337
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:05,789
and just be.

338
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:11,669
You married Matthew, who's a ripper, an elite rugby player before he hurt his back, and

339
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:16,990
then two beautiful kids, Evelyn and Austin.

340
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,730
What are you like on the home front as a mum and a leader on that front?

341
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,429
Sometimes I'm a pain in the ass and my daughter's just going through puberty, so she'd probably

342
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,669
highly agree with that.

343
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,929
This will not surprise you.

344
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:29,769
I like everything organised.

345
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,470
I think five meals a head.

346
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,570
So at the start of the week, I know what I'm cooking for the rest of the week.

347
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,529
And when I know I'm going to be away.

348
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,570
I leave meals frozen.

349
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,590
So when I was going into the jungle to do Celebrity, I had 30 frozen meals.

350
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:42,149
You didn't, did you?

351
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:42,590
I did.

352
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,529
Because I knew that Matthew was like, he's a farmer and I, like he can cook, he's great.

353
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,950
But, you know, kids sport, I knew he was going to be out all the time.

354
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,750
And, you know, I show my family I love them by feeding them, by cooking for them.

355
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,409
And so I was like, if I cook for them, then they'll know that I'm thinking of them, even

356
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,990
though I can't talk to them while I'm in the jungle.

357
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,970
So, and what else am I like?

358
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,990
Oh, you know what?

359
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,269
I.

360
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,250
I like to think that, um, I like to think that I'm fun, but I also, you know, I don't

361
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,789
let them have screens during the week, um, which they hate, but I'm like, well, we've

362
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:16,869
got 160 acres.

363
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,349
You've got dogs and chooks and cows and bikes and bulls and get out, get out of the house.

364
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,430
So my mum always tells me I'm too hard on my kids, but by the same token, like I love

365
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,049
reading with them.

366
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,109
I spend time with them.

367
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,950
Um, and I always tell Matthew that I'm a top smiths.

368
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,369
Some days he agrees.

369
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,490
Some days he doesn't.

370
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,869
Yeah, and bad luck when he doesn't.

371
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,369
Yeah, exactly.

372
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,769
Well, I, you know, he's good looking bloke.

373
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,029
So I like to keep him on the farm.

374
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,569
We're the only women he sees at Bovine.

375
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,490
He's a good catch, Matty.

376
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:46,890
One of the great, uh, people.

377
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,369
And I, I, a lot of people talk about, um, balancing life.

378
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,890
I think you just go and do it and make decisions.

379
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,529
And I remember talking to you when we were working together, you know, all those years

380
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:59,829
ago, more than a decade ago, how are you going to move out into a farm outside of Byron?

381
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,609
And you go and do it.

382
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:04,609
And I'm going to take 12 months off, which you've just done and get in the caravan and

383
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,390
take the kids around.

384
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,890
Australia.

385
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,609
How do you make those decisions and just make them happen?

386
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:15,069
Oh, look, uh, I make, I tend to be very decisive without often thinking through the pros and

387
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:15,930
cons of a decision.

388
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,930
Like it sounds very great.

389
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,869
Yeah, I'm really decisive.

390
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,670
I go and do it.

391
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,450
But, um, whereas Matthew is the opposite.

392
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,930
He is not a decider.

393
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,950
He likes to look at things like it took him seven years to ask him to marry me.

394
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,430
So he really had a long, hard think about it.

395
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,230
So, um, look, I think I tend to go with my gut a lot, which isn't great.

396
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,430
Um, but then sometimes I feel like you can really get paralysis by analysis.

397
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,329
So we're a good pair.

398
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,210
And I think if you, if you like me and you like a decision, just make the decision and

399
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,029
go, it's good to have someone who's your partner, whether in business or, you know,

400
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,670
personally who says to you, well, hang on, let's just weigh up the pros and cons of this

401
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,490
and work out.

402
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,289
And so, you know, one of the failures that I had, particularly in business was years

403
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:02,230
ago, a friend of mine and I bought into an ice cream franchise and, um, it failed miserably

404
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,190
and I didn't do my homework and I went, yeah, this would be great.

405
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,670
This is a gut decision off we go.

406
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:09,869
And we lost a significant amount of money, but I learned from that.

407
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,210
And I learned that if you're going to make a large decision like that, you've got to

408
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,509
go and speak to people about it.

409
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:18,250
So, you know, sometimes it's good to make decisions, you know, and when we're talking

410
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,130
about moving up to the country, we'll just, we, we talked about it a little bit.

411
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,670
Matthew was a farmer when he was younger with his father.

412
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,230
And then he went to Sydney to play football and was very successful in business and he'd

413
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,869
sold his business.

414
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:32,869
And it was like, he was talking about maybe one day wanting to go back to being a farmer

415
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,809
and we're at Gold Coast airport.

416
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,309
Had a few wines, which is when the best decisions are made and because our plane got delayed

417
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,910
and he said, you know, one day I would, I'd like to move up here.

418
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,670
And I said to him, well, people who say one day, just don't, don't get, never get it done.

419
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,029
One day is, is always sometime in the future.

420
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,190
We either do it now or we don't talk about it.

421
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,430
And so we sat and made a list of all the things we needed to do.

422
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,569
And the first thing obviously was put our house on the market in Sydney and I woke up

423
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,410
the next morning and before he could change his mind, I just rang the real estate agents

424
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,490
and come over.

425
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,829
So that's probably a really good example because, you know, I speak to people now and they're

426
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,349
like, oh, I wish we could do it.

427
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,329
And anyone can do it.

428
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,250
There's no laws to say you can't sell in the city and move to the country.

429
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,950
It was easier for us because we didn't have kids.

430
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,670
But I just sort of knew that if, if you talk about one day doing it, those days just like

431
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,650
when he's one day, so you put a limit on it and you go and do it.

432
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,690
And, um, you know, and it was a bit similar with the holiday last year.

433
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,250
It was something that I always wanted to do.

434
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,670
And that took a lot more convincing for Matthew to do.

435
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:32,809
Yeah.

436
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:32,829
Yeah.

437
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:32,849
Yeah.

438
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:32,910
Yeah.

439
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:32,930
Yeah.

440
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:32,950
Yeah.

441
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,970
Yeah.

442
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:32,990
Yeah.

443
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,009
Yeah.

444
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:33,029
Yeah.

445
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,089
Yeah.

446
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:33,109
Yeah.

447
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,069
And someone said to me, you know, I was working for channel nine and I've been there for five

448
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,089
years and I loved it.

449
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,029
And someone said to me, I can't believe you're walking away from your broadcast career when

450
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:42,990
it's really at its peak.

451
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,869
You know, I was commentating netball and I was on sports Sunday and I was doing some

452
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,349
other things.

453
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,450
I just said, my priority is my family, my kids.

454
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,950
And I know that they're going to grow up and have their own life.

455
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,289
And I want to have this, this year with them now.

456
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,049
So I think decision-making, good decision-making is about being really clear about your priorities

457
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,410
and what's important.

458
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,289
And for me, I've always been really firm in what's important to me is Matthew and the

459
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:06,569
kids.

460
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,630
And that is the thing that all my decisions are filtered through.

461
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,470
And they talk about, uh, the, the trip around Australia.

462
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:17,730
One of my best mates in life who I've, uh, interviewed on this podcast, Craig Ellis,

463
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,730
who founded Triangle Bikini and we played footy together.

464
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,430
And I'd still hear a story from his trip around Australia when he was eight.

465
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,309
He's still coming up with them to this day.

466
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:30,549
It's like, mate, it gave him this whole perspective.

467
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,170
He loved travel on the back of it.

468
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,750
Was it as good as you thought it was going to be with the kids?

469
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,289
Yeah, it was.

470
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,130
So my parents took my sister and I out of school and did the same trip in 1982.

471
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:44,490
So in 2022, it was, we left nearly 40 years to the day after that.

472
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,650
And that was really significant for me because I thought it'd be nice to just mark that

473
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,089
anniversary.

474
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,470
You know, my dad's not alive anymore.

475
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,130
So it was nice to think about him in that regard because he really drove that trip.

476
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:59,210
But I knew from that trip that it had really opened my eyes and opened my horizons.

477
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,730
And I realized from then I was.

478
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,309
Maybe eight, same, same age as your mate, just about how big Australia is and how amazing

479
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,569
it is in the history and the culture that's out there and the geography and the science.

480
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:17,029
And I thought I really wanted to give my kids that experience, but I also knew that it brought

481
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,230
our family really close together.

482
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,430
So when my dad was dying, you and I were working together at the time, I'd go to the hospital

483
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,769
and we'd often have conversations about that trip or about experiences that we had.

484
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,210
And it was so nice.

485
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,710
Like on your deathbed, no, like I didn't want to, dad and I didn't want to talk about how

486
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,009
hard he'd worked or, you know, his journey.

487
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:32,049
Yeah.

488
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:32,069
Yeah.

489
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:32,089
Yeah.

490
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:32,130
Yeah.

491
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,150
Yeah.

492
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,849
We talked about our family experiences in that holiday and a few others.

493
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:39,410
And I thought, I want to bank that for our kids and our family.

494
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:43,309
And I realized when we were doing it, because I thought initially it was about getting to

495
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,849
know your kids and being part of their lives.

496
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,329
But what they got was to know us because Matthew and I at home are really capable.

497
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,410
We know what's going on.

498
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,309
You know, he's a farmer.

499
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,589
He's on top of all of that.

500
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,289
But they saw us have no idea about what we were doing.

501
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,089
We had a, we don't fight very often.

502
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,750
We had a massive blow up one day because we'd left the caravan.

503
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,289
And I found that we're on the Gibb River Road, which is like, it's in the Kimberley.

504
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,009
It's really rough.

505
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,750
And we left the caravan and packed the tent to drive up to Mitchell Falls.

506
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,009
And the road was terrifically rough.

507
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,210
And I said to Matthew, did you pack the butane containers?

508
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:17,009
And he goes, no, for the stove.

509
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:17,490
And I'm like, right.

510
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,170
We're eating raw pasta and raw sausage.

511
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,950
And I went off my head.

512
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,329
And kids just sat there and they were like.

513
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,549
But it was so good for them to see us lose our, lose our shit and then work together

514
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:31,509
and then figure it out.

515
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:35,150
And what happened was that Matthew, who is inherently shy, got to the campgrounds and

516
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,309
he went and asked around and had to swap our cold beer for butane cans.

517
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,869
I'm like, we don't have any beer.

518
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,109
But they saw us work through that.

519
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,869
And I think it was so good for them to see us have no idea what we were doing for nearly

520
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,470
12 months.

521
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,069
I'm thinking of another great friend of mine, Bob Murphy, who's as hopeless as me.

522
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,150
I would be, I'd need to take Matthew on the trip around Australia.

523
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,369
And he bought his camper van, first stop, tried to drive through a bottle and took the

524
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,950
whole top off the bottle.

525
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,490
Stop it.

526
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,349
At their first.

527
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,329
Oh my God.

528
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:09,410
And if you know him, you know that that was always a chance to happen.

529
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,470
That's like a nightmare scenario.

530
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,069
It's incredible.

531
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,130
I'm going to come back to the ice cream business and that not working for you.

532
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,970
How did, how did you cope?

533
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,849
And tell us a bit more about that.

534
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,650
I didn't cope very well actually, because I'm so used to succeeding and no matter how

535
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,410
hard I worked, the business was so poor that it didn't matter.

536
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:27,930
I could have worked in there 24 seven and it made no difference.

537
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,349
And, um, it took, it didn't take long.

538
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:34,390
It didn't take very long for us to figure out that we'd actually made a huge balls up

539
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,670
and my business partner took her a little bit longer to get there.

540
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,970
And, uh, I sort of went through like the seven stages of grief, like anger and denial.

541
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,029
And I went through a stage.

542
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:48,529
I didn't want to even hear about it or talk about it or think about it or go down there

543
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,289
because it was in manly.

544
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,809
Um, and then when we realized that we just had to get rid of it, it was about cutting

545
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:55,269
our losses.

546
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,069
And I, it just showed me everything that I didn't do.

547
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,910
I didn't do my market research properly.

548
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,329
I didn't know how to do it.

549
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,970
I didn't understand the ins and outs of a commercial lease.

550
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,009
I didn't understand the franchising model.

551
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,349
I didn't, there was so much I didn't understand.

552
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,009
I loved what we were serving, but the actual food component is such a small part of it.

553
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,029
It's all the business that sits behind it.

554
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,650
And, you know, I've got a lot, I thought I was, I was overconfident.

555
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,369
I've got a law degree.

556
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:24,450
I can read it, but I didn't really take the time to sit and understand the ramifications.

557
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,809
And I actually never, before we went into it, I never sat and thought about if all this

558
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,670
goes pear shaped, what does that mean?

559
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,710
And so there was, we lost a lot of money.

560
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,670
And fortunately I was in a position where like it was, it ended up, you know, you get

561
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,950
past that and you move on.

562
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,450
And it wasn't the money that hurt.

563
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:44,650
It was the fact that I'd been in charge of something that failed.

564
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,690
And it really took me a long time to speak about it and to acknowledge that we'd had

565
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,410
that business and it hadn't gone very well.

566
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,890
And, you know, it taught me about businesses that like buying a franchise into a franchise

567
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,250
is okay, but it doesn't really give you the scale that you need to what I thought we'd

568
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,490
get.

569
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,049
So, you know, you'd need to be prepared to buy two or three or something like that.

570
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,390
And there's various business models out there, but it also showed me the value of growing

571
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,650
a business organically and being able to control it and understand it and learn as you go.

572
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:17,829
So jumping in that deep end was awful and it cost me a small fortune, but I just learnt

573
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:18,950
so much from it.

574
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,349
And I learnt the questions that I should have asked and which now when I get presented

575
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,289
with things that I do take the time to ask and understand.

576
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,509
We don't like the hard lessons at any stage, do we?

577
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:30,650
No.

578
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,730
But they are the best ones in the end, aren't they?

579
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:36,529
You end up with this incredible, you know, the detail that you would approach other things

580
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,869
that you wouldn't have previously.

581
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,289
Well, there's a great saying, you often find out what we'll do by finding out what we'll

582
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:41,670
not do.

583
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:44,430
And he who never made a mistake never made a discovery, right?

584
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:48,609
So if everything in your life that you touch turns to gold, you actually don't learn that

585
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:48,910
much.

586
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:53,269
You learn so much more from failure about the questions you should ask, about the understandings,

587
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,069
about your relationships as well.

588
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:55,569
Yeah.

589
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,269
And I love if you don't take a risk, then you don't get to anywhere at the same stage.

590
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,589
And it's great to share those stories.

591
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:05,069
Because you read the headline and the bio and you go, that's just a blessed life.

592
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:08,470
But in reality, we've all got these hurdles that come up.

593
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,670
And you're an author as well, Liz, a book about fertility.

594
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:20,109
If at first you don't conceive was the title of the book and talks openly about your troubles

595
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,789
with fertility or challenging time in your life.

596
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:23,650
Can you share a bit about that?

597
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:23,950
Yeah.

598
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,309
Bloody Austin, he took his time.

599
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,529
So I'm in love now.

600
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,569
But look, we had no trouble falling pregnant with Evelyn.

601
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:34,410
You and I worked in Delhi and Matthew and I went away to Europe after that.

602
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,849
And we're like, right, when we get back, we'll try and have a child and see how we go.

603
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,970
And we're pregnant within six weeks.

604
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,410
We're like, oh, this is so easy.

605
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:44,309
And we used to joke, we had more sex getting her out than getting her in, right?

606
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,809
Is that too much information for your podcast, Luke?

607
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,069
It reminds me of working with you.

608
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,730
Oh, the stuff that you shouldn't say in front of a microphone.

609
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,069
Anyway, stop blushing.

610
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm midway through my story.

611
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,650
And then we had Evelyn.

612
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:00,569
And we went to the...

613
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:02,950
Obstetrician, he goes, well, you need to start straight away because you're old.

614
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:03,690
So I was 39.

615
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,009
I thought to myself, we'll be fine.

616
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,609
And we were pregnant really quickly again after that.

617
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,670
And then we had a miscarriage.

618
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,890
And then nothing happened.

619
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,769
So we started through the journey of fertility drugs and IVF and fell pregnant a couple more times.

620
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,529
And the last time on IVF, we fell pregnant.

621
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:22,809
And we got to about nearly the 12-week mark.

622
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,109
And we'd seen the heartbeat on the ultrasound.

623
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,730
And then we get to the next appointment and there's no heartbeat.

624
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,670
And that...

625
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,509
Like, speaking of failure.

626
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,890
I really struggled with that because I was so used to my body doing what I'd asked it to do for all these years.

627
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,009
And suddenly, it would not grow a baby for me.

628
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,730
And, you know, I was old.

629
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:44,089
But when I had my last miscarriage, I was 41, maybe 42.

630
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,109
And I thought, well, that's it.

631
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,029
It's all passed me by.

632
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,029
And mum kept saying to me...

633
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,829
She kept telling me these stories about people who had stopped trying and fallen pregnant.

634
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,049
And I'm like, mum, I've never achieved anything in my life by not trying.

635
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:56,569
Right?

636
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,650
So I'd have these big spits at her.

637
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,390
And God love her.

638
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,150
She puts up with me.

639
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:04,369
And then, funnily enough, we stopped trying.

640
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,170
Because we thought, we're focusing so hard on this kid that we don't have.

641
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,210
We're actually not focusing on the kid that we do have.

642
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,230
You know, Evelyn would have been three or four by that point.

643
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,690
We thought, we're really lucky.

644
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,049
We've got a healthy, beautiful girl.

645
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,009
That's it.

646
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,009
We'll just sit back and enjoy her.

647
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:22,089
And then one night we had a bottle of champagne and one thing led to another.

648
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,170
Too much information again.

649
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,609
Yeah.

650
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,430
And we fell pregnant with Austin.

651
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,150
And we're like, that's just his personality.

652
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,589
He doesn't do anything until he's ready.

653
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,329
So, but that whole thing was about like writing that book.

654
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,009
I actually had a massive pile of papers in my office and I went to throw them out.

655
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,190
And I thought, there's actually a book in this.

656
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:47,049
Not so much collating this, but getting, having all this information and then relating it

657
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,609
to what happens in the real world.

658
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,630
And I wanted to write a book that was like your best friend holding your hand, pouring

659
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,849
you a wine and saying, right, I'm going to talk you through this.

660
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:59,990
So I do make lots of jokes in the book about vaginal discharge and erectile dysfunction.

661
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,589
And then all that sort of stuff.

662
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,309
Are you happy you don't work with me anymore?

663
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,509
But it's science, Luke.

664
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:07,089
It's science.

665
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,650
So I write about this stuff, but then I make jokes about like, you know, like I've got

666
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,250
a pure old sense of humor.

667
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,009
So I just make jokes all the way through the book.

668
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,130
But I want it to be really like what happens when you go through infertility.

669
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,289
A, no one ever talks about it or miscarriage.

670
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,549
No one knows the words to talk about.

671
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:27,349
And so many women miscarry.

672
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,089
And we never have a conversation about.

673
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,890
And then so many people are going through infertility or fertility treatment and don't

674
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,150
know how to talk about it and often don't know how to talk about it to each other.

675
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:44,450
So I wanted to provide in my book a bit of a way to work out language, to speak with

676
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:44,869
each other.

677
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:47,869
And people often talk about the cost of IVF.

678
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:53,529
And so like I did a bit of a budget, but I also did an emotional budget, which is these

679
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,609
are the things you're going to face.

680
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,829
And these are the things you should talk about before you go into it with your partner so

681
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,950
that when they happen, you've got the language ready.

682
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,809
And I've heard from people who said it saved their marriage because they knew how to talk

683
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:05,190
to each other.

684
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,289
They knew what was coming.

685
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:12,849
And the hardest part for the book for me was writing about what to do when, if you don't

686
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:18,150
get a child at the end of all this, because I got my baby and I found this woman in Perth.

687
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,789
It was amazing.

688
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,349
And she really talked me through the process that she went through.

689
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:26,589
And at the end of the book, she shares an email that she sent out to all her friends

690
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,809
and family banks, basically saying what had been happening.

691
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:30,130
And, you know, this is what.

692
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,089
I don't want to talk about.

693
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,529
This is what I do want to talk about.

694
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,069
And I think there's great merit in explaining that to people.

695
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:41,390
I've tried ever since to have conversations with people about miscarriage and fertility

696
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,289
and that sort of stuff.

697
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:47,390
So when I went into, um, into, into the jungle for celebrity, we had a conversation about

698
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,210
miscarriage and that conversation has continued since we've got out with, you know, Deb Lawrence

699
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:58,230
and I working with a group called the pink elephants, um, about helping women through

700
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,970
and families through miscarriage.

701
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,670
Um, because there's lots of things that we just, it's a bit hard to talk about.

702
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,609
It's a bit sort of like, it can be awkward.

703
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:07,410
Yeah.

704
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,009
How do you do it?

705
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,690
Well, you're the perfect person for that.

706
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,029
Cause there's no awkward, uh, with you and it's a great super, and you're authentically

707
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:16,670
you in every situation and that comes across.

708
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,849
And I think, uh, if you're going through it, you'd be happy to share even, you know, if

709
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:28,690
it makes people like me uncomfortable, as you know, which happens so easily, uh, I tell

710
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,589
you what, it's been great.

711
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:33,650
I'm really connecting with you, haven't seen you for a while and really appreciate you

712
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,950
being part of our Let It Connect, uh, space, which we're really passionate about, you know,

713
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,750
this idea that we felt the world's got a bit siloed and people are retreating back into

714
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,490
their spaces and connecting groups of great people like you together.

715
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,130
How have you found that, uh, that space of Let It Connect?

716
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,950
I've loved it.

717
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:55,529
And the thing that I've loved about it is not just the meetings that we have with our

718
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:55,809
group.

719
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:59,470
It's the thinking that you do for days and days afterwards.

720
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,589
Someone says something and it sparks a thought.

721
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,950
And I found that I would go back and look at things that I was doing in a different light

722
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,390
and particularly around for me at the moment, my leadership is a bit sort of, um, fuzzy

723
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,109
because I don't have a leadership position.

724
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,390
I don't have a badge that says I'm the chair or I'm the leader.

725
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,930
I'm the CEO.

726
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,190
It's really within my sport and within women's sport.

727
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:27,410
I'm just someone who I try to lead by, um, keeping people talking about the issues and

728
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,390
it actually gave me a really good way.

729
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,849
To think about how to do that a little bit differently.

730
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,509
I've been banging on about it for 30 years.

731
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:37,910
Luke, at some point you've got to do something differently, but you know, it got me thinking

732
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,670
about different ways of doing things and just the things that I need to work on.

733
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,529
Like there's times when I think people are, the person I'm trying to convince is not listening

734
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:50,150
to me and rather than thinking, which I do, it's their fault.

735
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,950
I'd actually got me thinking about, okay, this is how I need to address my communication

736
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,529
with them.

737
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,210
So it was so valuable.

738
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,210
And the little group that we've got is great.

739
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,430
And I'm really looking forward to sort of continuing to connect with them into the future

740
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,109
because we're all so very different.

741
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:10,809
So yeah, it was, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

742
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,030
So yeah, we love, and you're always going to be an amazing contributor, but I think

743
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,530
that's a great point Liz around this idea.

744
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,670
People think we need a title or I need to be, you know, a current captain or I need

745
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,130
to be CEO to do that.

746
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:27,309
But every moment we've got a chance, having on the home front with our kids or, um, our

747
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:28,070
friendship groups.

748
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,030
There's a chance for us to learn from each other on how, you know, it sounds a bit

749
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,369
altruistic around living a better life essentially, isn't it?

750
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:34,690
Totally.

751
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,989
It's a, it's a constant thing that, isn't it?

752
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,329
It is.

753
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,130
And you know, um, the first person that taught me that was, you know, Sheila, the woman who

754
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,849
got me into netball doesn't have the badge.

755
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,989
And, you know, I think about her a lot actually as a leader, because now I'm coaching the

756
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:52,510
under 12s headland dolphins team, my daughter's netball team.

757
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,849
It's so stressful.

758
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,369
Anyone who's coached 12 year old girls would know the pain that I feel on a week to week

759
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:57,789
basis.

760
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,190
But like, I do really feel the responsibility that I've got in my hands.

761
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,230
I'm holding their, like their netball experience in my hands.

762
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,690
And I feel that responsibility deeply.

763
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,710
And even the stuff that we did with the Alita group, I took it back to my coaching of them

764
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,929
to make sure that I was doing it in the best way possible and, and allowing them to hopefully

765
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:19,110
one day having someone in that group to pay it forward.

766
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,590
And I see them now stand up and they umpire and they work at the canteen and I'm so proud

767
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,090
of them because they're learning leadership, you know, from all.

768
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,349
All these older women around them in our little netball club and they're now doing it and then

769
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,590
they'll pay it on one day too.

770
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,170
So it's just phenomenal.

771
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,090
And that, I think that's one of the great things about sport.

772
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,690
And it's the genius of someone like you going back to junior sport and doing it consciously

773
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,130
and making sure it's good for everyone in the team.

774
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,670
It's another one of my great, uh, hobbies here, Liz, is the craziness of junior sport.

775
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:54,889
I don't know how mental it has got and, and parents going ballistic at the sidelines and

776
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,789
screaming at 12 and 13 year old umpire.

777
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:57,530
Have you seen that?

778
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,429
I haven't, I haven't seen it, but I think everyone's too scared when I'm around to behave

779
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,750
like that, but I certainly do hear about it.

780
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,570
And well, I'm in the country, right?

781
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,170
I'm in a little, a little country sort of group, but I've have seen it a little bit

782
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,969
when the kids have gone on to state champs and things like that.

783
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:18,130
And I, I see it creep into netball because suddenly my sport is professional, right?

784
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,809
So parents really have ambitions for their kids.

785
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,610
And I just think, I always think back to my parents.

786
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:27,869
They were so laid back about my netball career.

787
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:28,070
They were.

788
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,989
I was a bit surprised.

789
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,309
Like even when I got selected for the diamonds, dad goes, Oh, I didn't think you were that

790
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:32,550
good.

791
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,530
I'm not saying do that to your kids, but understand that their sport is their dreams.

792
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,630
It's not your dreams.

793
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,570
And like you and I can understand that because we've been there, right?

794
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,010
You know, you've played your AFL career.

795
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,050
I've played my netball career.

796
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,789
I don't need my kid to do it, but there are, I do understand there are people who have

797
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:56,289
those dreams for their kids, but also understand that if you go too hard on that, your kid

798
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,429
is likely to walk away.

799
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:57,449
Yeah.

800
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:57,510
Yeah.

801
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:57,530
Yeah.

802
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:57,550
Yeah.

803
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:57,570
Yeah.

804
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:57,590
Yeah.

805
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:57,610
Yeah.

806
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:57,630
Yeah.

807
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:57,690
Yeah.

808
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:57,710
Yeah.

809
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:57,730
Yeah.

810
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:57,789
Yeah.

811
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:58,070
Yeah.

812
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,250
It serves the opposite purpose to what you're trying to do.

813
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:04,250
So, you know, at the start of the season, I do say to the parents, can we make sure that

814
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,269
we're encouraging and that, you know, that we're, even when you get home in front of

815
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,869
your kids, try not to speak disparagingly about another kid in the group because they'll

816
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:13,969
carry that with them to training.

817
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:18,429
So again, that's about like when I talk about my book or anything else, it's about the language.

818
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,690
Like before you even start, think about the language you're going to use and hopefully

819
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,110
it's sort of coming through.

820
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,190
Okay.

821
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,070
Listen to Rod Campbell's podcast.

822
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,769
That I had a great conversation, learning life through sport.

823
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:36,389
It's exactly your language, Liz, is just teaching kids leadership for life through sport and

824
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,869
good respect and respecting the umpires and their teammates.

825
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,630
And I know it sounds easy, but it feels as though this world has got a bit crazy on that

826
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,909
front now that is not helping kids at all.

827
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,210
And it should be the happiest place.

828
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,650
Junior sport for everyone should be the place where they go and be happy.

829
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,849
Liz, we had someone in our world use the term success leaves clues.

830
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:11,670
What does that mean to you?

831
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,010
It means a couple of things.

832
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,989
It means, um, I reflect on my behavior often.

833
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,809
I think self-reflection is really important.

834
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,670
And when I was in a team and a leader within the team, I'd often reflect on conversations

835
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,190
that I'd had or things that went wrong or went right in the game.

836
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,090
What was my role?

837
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,170
How can I do that better?

838
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:31,849
And I've always been a bit harsh on myself in that regard, because I think that's where

839
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,670
you like, you've got to be honest with yourself.

840
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,530
And if that means being hard, then so be it.

841
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,429
Sometimes I think my self-talk could be better, but the last thing I, and the world needs

842
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,469
is me with a bigger ego.

843
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:47,349
So, so, you know, I, but I do engage in a lot of self-reflection just at home or, you

844
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:49,289
know, when I'm on the plane or driving somewhere.

845
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:55,230
Um, and I think to me, a lot of people who are successful do that because, you know,

846
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,769
one of the great things that sport teaches you is you can,

847
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,409
you can blame the umpire, but then you lose control of changing anything.

848
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,389
So actually look at yourself first.

849
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:04,130
So that's where I started with self-reflection.

850
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:09,670
And I'm really careful about, um, I don't know that you can achieve balance because

851
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,829
you always have crazy moments, but I'm really careful about having, um, nice things to look

852
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:15,690
forward to, right?

853
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,469
Because that makes you a better leader because you're more centered.

854
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,489
You're able to focus on the moment because you know something good's coming, which, um,

855
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,969
drives Matthew insane because I'm always wanting to book holidays, but like, it's just about

856
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:27,750
looking after yourself.

857
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:31,849
And allowing yourself to be in a happy place because you've got a few other things under

858
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:32,210
control.

859
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,590
And the big thing I've learned, especially since having kids is the power of saying no.

860
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,590
I used to think I had to say yes to everything, especially when I left the law firm and went

861
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,210
freelance.

862
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:46,949
I was like, oh my God, this job could be my last, but I've survived, I don't know, 25

863
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:47,809
years doing that.

864
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:53,170
So now I understand that I can say no, especially if it doesn't suit what I'm doing with my

865
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,550
family.

866
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,750
And that makes me a better leader because when I'm there or wherever I am.

867
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:01,829
Um, I'm actually really invested in it because I know that I've given myself space to be

868
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:04,010
with my family and to do the things that I like to do.

869
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,469
You've got some clarity on that, Liz.

870
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,130
I love it.

871
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,110
I'm a bit like you too.

872
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,250
I'm the same.

873
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,630
It's got to be something coming up in the next 24, 48 hours that I'm really looking

874
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,090
forward to.

875
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,389
Otherwise I get a bit, uh, edgy.

876
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:17,230
I'm a bit in our house booking holidays all the time as well.

877
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,449
Uh, and I think, yeah, that's almost like a club for me.

878
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,510
Self-reflection is that there are a group of people that that's not really who they

879
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:24,889
are.

880
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,750
And, um, it seems as though you're very, very clear.

881
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,050
We see leaders are really conscious, Liz, on a daily basis, how they have a positive

882
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,429
impact on other people from moment to moment.

883
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,409
How do you think about that?

884
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,510
There is no, I think, shame in being kind to people.

885
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,429
And I really try that.

886
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,150
Like I know I've got a sharp tongue and sometimes I have to think about that.

887
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,449
As you know, Luke, I'm like, oh, I shouldn't have said that.

888
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:48,929
Go back and think about it.

889
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:50,250
But, you know, just being kind.

890
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:55,090
I think that you can have a positive impact every day on someone by being kind to someone

891
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,409
who you don't have to be kind to.

892
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:57,489
Holding a door open.

893
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,110
Or saying thank you.

894
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,889
Like that doesn't cost you anything, but it has a massive impact on someone's day.

895
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:08,510
And I really do try now, I've been guilty of not doing in the past, but I do try now

896
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,110
to lead with kindness and show that you can actually be a strong person and a decisive

897
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:18,610
person, but still care about people who you come into contact with in your day.

898
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,829
And I, I try and do that with my kids as well.

899
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,929
And Matthew and I have always said through our marriage that, you know, you hear some

900
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:27,650
people who are married speak to each other.

901
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:31,650
And they're like, and then they'll say mean things to each other.

902
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,530
And then they'll go and be nice to someone who they don't have to be nice to.

903
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,949
Whereas we have always said that we are, we're nicer to each other than we are to anyone

904
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:39,809
else in our day.

905
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:41,349
And that sets the tone in our household.

906
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,010
We try and do that with the kids.

907
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:48,829
And even when they drive me insane, I really do try and take a big, deep breath and explain

908
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:50,710
to them why I'm, I've got the shit.

909
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,150
Sometimes that doesn't work.

910
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,329
And sometimes it does work.

911
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:54,510
And sometimes I just yell.

912
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,510
But that's okay.

913
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,809
And I engage in self-reflection.

914
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,190
But.

915
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,849
I think if you start in your immediate circle with kindness and being respectful and the

916
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:05,469
way you run your close relationships, that sort of ripples out into everything else.

917
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:05,949
Yeah.

918
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,929
Beautifully said, isn't it?

919
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:11,969
The kids, you know, often, um, you can talk to them when they're older about what you

920
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:15,650
think values are like, but they observe every minute thing.

921
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,050
Everything.

922
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:19,929
And that forms really their own sense of what relationships look like.

923
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,469
And I think Beck and I have articulated it quite like you and Matt, but certainly how

924
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:24,309
we feel, isn't it?

925
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,469
Yeah.

926
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:24,750
Yeah.

927
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:24,809
Yeah.

928
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:24,869
Yeah.

929
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:24,889
Yeah.

930
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:24,949
Yeah.

931
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:24,969
Yeah.

932
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:24,989
Yeah.

933
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:25,050
Yeah.

934
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,070
Yeah.

935
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,090
Yeah.

936
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:25,130
Yeah.

937
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,150
Yeah.

938
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,170
Yeah.

939
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:25,190
Yeah.

940
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,210
Yeah.

941
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,230
Yeah.

942
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,250
Yeah.

943
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,269
Yeah.

944
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:25,309
Yeah.

945
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:25,329
Yeah.

946
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:30,289
See us spending time together and talking to each other the way that we do, then it's

947
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,230
got to be a positive impact.

948
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:32,690
And it's an easy thing, isn't it?

949
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,929
Like the, the, the opportunities are there all the time.

950
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:39,590
Uh, leaders who are conscious about how they go about creating and sharing a vision for

951
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,269
whatever they do.

952
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:44,190
And you've had so many things in your life that you've gone and tackled.

953
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:48,849
And it seems like you've always got clarity on that when you're needing to achieve something.

954
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,730
How have you gone about creating and sharing a vision?

955
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,309
Um, I think I've always got like, I've, I've always.

956
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:57,750
I've always had a vision and always known what, what needs to be done.

957
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,130
I think where I've been guilty of not doing things properly is not enunciating that properly

958
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:03,889
with my teammates.

959
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:06,269
Like I just assume we're all going in the same direction.

960
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:09,590
We all want the same thing and we all know, but then you speak to people and I'm like,

961
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,710
oh, right.

962
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,769
Well, we've got a different idea of what this looks like.

963
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:18,309
So I've always tried to make sure learning that has made me ensure that you just have

964
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:18,829
conversations.

965
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:23,130
I think the key part of leadership is communication and that's not telling people what to do.

966
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,309
That's listening to what other people's ideas.

967
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:27,289
And I had to learn that as a leader.

968
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:29,389
Like I initially, I was like, it's my way of the highway.

969
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,489
This is how we're doing it.

970
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,809
And that worked for a short while, but it's exhausting and it's unsustainable.

971
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:38,510
So I soon learned that you had to listen to people and get their buy-in and let them tell

972
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,989
you where they wanted to get to and then work out a way to make that working with what the

973
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:43,489
team needed.

974
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,510
So for me, that clarity has always been there in my mind.

975
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,929
The challenge has been to be able to bring everyone else along or to make sure that everyone

976
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,590
else that works for them as well.

977
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,309
So, you know, I think listen.

978
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:59,510
And it was interesting, you know, in our, in our leader group, it was really interesting.

979
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,530
We had Brendan Laid and he just is so good at that.

980
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:08,130
He listens and he thinks, and then he says something a long time after that, that takes

981
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,150
you back to that conversation.

982
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,929
Whereas, you know, there's people and I'm one of them.

983
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:14,769
I listened to you and I started to think about what the next thing is that I'm going to say.

984
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:20,750
So like I'm clear in my mind, but what I need to do is listen to you or anyone else and

985
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,670
go, okay, what do you need to know that you have this clarity as well?

986
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:25,110
Yeah.

987
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,130
Yeah.

988
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:25,150
Yeah.

989
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,170
Yeah.

990
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:25,190
Yeah.

991
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,210
Yeah.

992
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:25,230
Yeah.

993
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:25,289
Yeah.

994
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:25,309
Yeah.

995
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,989
The great gift is having someone like a lady who I've known for a long time is a big farmer

996
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:31,090
from Kangaroo Island.

997
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:36,210
And yeah, it's the quiet ones that listen well, that often know everything, don't they?

998
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:41,150
Because they're not in a race to, and when to say something, but when they do, it's often

999
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,750
more profound than anyone else.

1000
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,590
It's a great lesson for me too in, uh, in that I'm scarily like you, Liz, as you talk, as

1001
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,329
you're talking, I'm going, God, that's a bit of self-reflection for me.

1002
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,369
Um, we see leaders are really curious and through curiosity.

1003
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,869
They approach their learning and development.

1004
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:57,710
Does that resonate with you?

1005
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,570
Yeah, it does.

1006
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,730
I'm probably not as curious as, as other leaders might be.

1007
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:07,050
You know, I really like, I worry about the chaos that curiosity can cause.

1008
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,730
So I'm like, sometimes I'm like, no, I don't want to know about that because I really,

1009
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,969
I'm really focused on getting to this point rather than taking the side road.

1010
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:18,510
Whereas I learned through that ice cream shop experience that, um, it's not just curiosity,

1011
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,090
like being a kid curious, it's actually curious about understanding everything that you need

1012
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:22,630
to understand.

1013
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,429
That's really important.

1014
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:23,730
So.

1015
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,010
So it's probably not a natural trait.

1016
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,329
I'm really curious about, like, I like to read widely and about all different things

1017
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:33,610
and understand lots of things, but I need to be more, I, and it was really through the

1018
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,969
process of doing the course with a leader that I understood what curiosity, curiosity

1019
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:38,750
means in leadership.

1020
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:44,070
So I feel like I'm a curious person, but I need to be more curious about the decisions

1021
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,210
that I'm making and how I'm leading and what the potential impacts are.

1022
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:52,650
And that for me is something that I've taken away from this that I need to go away and

1023
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:52,969
learn on.

1024
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:54,469
And, and learn about and think about.

1025
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:57,349
I love that you know yourself so well though, Liz, you know your strengths and you know

1026
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:00,130
the, the parts that you want to spend some more time on.

1027
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,769
You, you are a great communicator.

1028
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:02,650
You always have been.

1029
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,929
And we see that as a common trait to communicating with clarity and whether it's captaining the

1030
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:09,449
Australian netball team or working in a law firm.

1031
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:10,670
Is that something you've given thought to?

1032
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,030
Yeah, but I do like a lot of people.

1033
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,909
Um, and it was interesting again, doing this course with a leader that, um, we're all very

1034
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:22,949
quick to talk about what we're not good at or what our focus is.

1035
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:25,909
What our failings are or what we don't do, which was really interesting.

1036
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,849
And I think a good leader does that, has understanding of that.

1037
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,670
Um, and for me, I'm a good communicator.

1038
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,289
I've, I've always in trouble for talking in class.

1039
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:35,949
There's a surprise.

1040
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:38,670
News flash.

1041
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,889
Um, but the challenge for me around communication was the flip side and that's listening.

1042
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,570
And I think communication is important.

1043
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:52,510
The ability to sell a vision to people and the ability to articulate what that looks like.

1044
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:57,510
Um, really clearly set out what the behaviors are and then very clearly talk about the

1045
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,710
accountabilities is really important, but in getting there, you actually need to learn

1046
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,650
to listen a lot to your team.

1047
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,630
And that to me has been what I've had to work on over the years.

1048
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:09,769
How important has a collaboration been for you Liz?

1049
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:11,090
Yeah, super important actually.

1050
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:15,849
And again, I tend to be someone who is really decisive in my decision-making as we've talked

1051
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:19,590
about, and I want to get out there and do it, but I've had to learn again, it's all

1052
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,750
the learnings about, um, about collaboration.

1053
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:27,710
Collaborating in leadership and letting go of things so that that collaboration can

1054
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:27,909
happen.

1055
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:33,250
I think when you're a leader and you, and you try to collaborate, you, you do need to

1056
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,650
understand that you can't do everything.

1057
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,929
And that was a real lesson for me, but then in terms of doing what I'm good at, which

1058
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:43,090
was playing netball and, and being a teammate, that collaboration was really easy because

1059
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,809
I learned very early on, especially in my sport, not one person can do it all.

1060
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,590
And that's what frustrated me about being a lawyer actually, was that I don't think

1061
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,590
law firms do collaboration particularly well.

1062
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,989
Or they didn't when I was practicing.

1063
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,090
In what way?

1064
00:47:55,809 --> 00:48:02,329
Um, it was very much, um, so every part, there was a series of partners who were all part

1065
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:05,050
of this business, but they all had their own business within the business.

1066
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:09,510
And they were really focused on their business because that's where the profitability and

1067
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,449
the money came from.

1068
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,769
Whereas I think if law firms and not just law firms, but certainly businesses look to

1069
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:19,969
collaborate with, within the businesses, things would get stronger and information would be

1070
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:20,269
shared.

1071
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,469
And I used to think that that didn't happen a lot.

1072
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,289
Because there was this real, well, I'm going to keep that for myself because that's my

1073
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:27,090
competitive advantage.

1074
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:27,449
Yeah.

1075
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:27,929
Yep.

1076
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,989
The, uh, the challenge of hierarchy in that world is a big shift.

1077
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,769
We think in the way great teams work now more than ever.

1078
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:36,429
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1079
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:39,409
Uh, I've had, I've been really fortunate.

1080
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:42,070
I've had lots of great leaders, but I'd have to start with my parents.

1081
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,170
You know, they set a really good example of what a great relationship looks like.

1082
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:50,909
I've, um, you know, I've since found out that their decision-making prism was, um, or the

1083
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:52,570
filter was, can we include them?

1084
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,510
Can we include our kids in this?

1085
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:54,289
Yes, we can.

1086
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:54,909
Well, we'll do it.

1087
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:55,469
No, we can't.

1088
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,190
Well, we won't do it.

1089
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:01,130
So, you know, they really set a great example for me of the sort of parent that I want to

1090
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:01,369
be.

1091
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,070
And I, I feel like that's like, regardless of all the corporate stuff and all of the

1092
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,329
business, your family is your basic unit.

1093
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:10,010
So to me, that's so important.

1094
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,969
So mum and dad really, um, were great leaders in that regard.

1095
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:16,670
You know, getting exposed to someone like Sheila, Sheila Ether was her name, and she

1096
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,769
was just amazing in the way that she got people into sports, seeing how that one person can

1097
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:22,110
be so powerful in a community.

1098
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,809
And then going through my netball career, Julie Fitzgerald really stands out to me.

1099
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:32,250
She was a great leader because she, um, she never played like above C grade at Karingai,

1100
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:37,190
yet she was a great coach because she was the, she's the queen of collaboration.

1101
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,309
She goes and gets the answers from her players.

1102
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,989
And so you feel like your, your input is valued.

1103
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:45,750
And so you buy into the game plan because it's part, partly yours.

1104
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:49,130
And so she was, has been successful over such a long period.

1105
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,269
And when I watch her coach now, she still gets excited.

1106
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:57,909
When someone does something well, as she did when I was, she had me in under 19s and like,

1107
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,550
so that was like 30 something years ago.

1108
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,510
So she's still got that great passion, but I really think her strength is that she doesn't

1109
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,690
pretend to know all the answers.

1110
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,929
And a lot of leaders could learn from that.

1111
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:10,409
Um, you know, and then when I was in the, in the diamonds, you know, Vicky Wilson was

1112
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:11,829
very much a lead by example.

1113
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:15,530
She wanted to be the biggest and the baddest and the strongest, and that was her solo leadership.

1114
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:20,230
And then Kath Harvey Williams was very similar, but she was, um, you know, much more able

1115
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,250
to bring, or she was also, she had her other team.

1116
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,849
Her strengths as well, which was, um, you know, working really well with the coach in

1117
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,170
a really collaborative manner and getting the best out of her, which I thought was interesting

1118
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,349
with her ability to manage up and then send it down to us as well.

1119
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:37,550
So, you know, I think every leader has good or bad, has things that you can learn from.

1120
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,989
And I've had leaders I've thought were not much chop, but rather than going, they're

1121
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:41,610
not much chop.

1122
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:43,969
I've actually looked at them and gone, how do I learn from that?

1123
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,650
How do I learn from what they don't do well?

1124
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,389
So that when it's my turn to lead, I will do well.

1125
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:48,789
Yeah.

1126
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:51,670
It sounds like you've grabbed pieces from everyone along the way.

1127
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,230
I was in preparation for this, watching some videos, Liz, and there's a great pictures

1128
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,710
of your mum and dad sitting at the netball and, uh, you know, I remember, you know, meeting

1129
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,050
them both and, uh, they've been in your corner every night.

1130
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,389
And you're right, starting there, isn't it?

1131
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:07,650
If you've got this gift of that example in life and, and you're obviously passing it

1132
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,230
on, you and Matt now, it's, uh, like winning the lottery in lots of ways, isn't it?

1133
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:11,630
For sure.

1134
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,769
If you could collaborate with anyone, we love the spirit of collaboration and the work we're

1135
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:15,769
doing at a leader.

1136
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:18,949
Is there been someone you thought, you know, what could be, I know you've got a range of

1137
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:21,389
different passions in a whole heap of different areas.

1138
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:25,570
If you thought that's the person I'd love to connect or collaborate with.

1139
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,530
Um, I got to work a few years ago with Kate Jenkins, who's a federal, was a federal sex

1140
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,070
discrimination commissioner at the time.

1141
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,250
She's so smart, like being in the room with smart people.

1142
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,489
And I just chit to chair, we were doing a state of the game review for netball and she

1143
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:39,889
was on it.

1144
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:44,530
And I was like, oh my God, I am, I am the dumbest person in this room and I've got to

1145
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:44,929
lead them.

1146
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:47,789
So that was like a real challenge for me because she's so smart.

1147
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:48,889
Joe Pollard was on that.

1148
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,650
She was really smart.

1149
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:51,349
And like.

1150
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,369
Really cluey.

1151
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,150
Um, and I just look at women like that and I go, God, they're so like, they're so across

1152
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:57,710
their field.

1153
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:02,289
I sometimes feel like I try to do so much that I'm not really across deeply into whatever

1154
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,650
field I'm doing, but they are.

1155
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:06,329
And particularly Kate, she's so across her field.

1156
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:08,170
So collaborating with her was just amazing.

1157
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,929
And, you know, at the start I was like, I'm the dumbest person in this room.

1158
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:12,730
How do I lead them?

1159
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,769
And how do I chair this group?

1160
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:17,190
And by the end of it, we'd worked out a really good way to work, which is I just listened

1161
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,150
to them and do what they told me to do.

1162
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,369
Uh, but yeah.

1163
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:27,050
Um, I just, I don't know that there's someone who I, I'll probably walk out of this room

1164
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,030
and think of 10 names and I'll ring you up and I'll go, Luke, Luke, what are, there's

1165
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,510
this person, there's this person, there's this person, there's this person.

1166
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:37,449
Um, it's hard to single someone out because every day I meet really interesting people.

1167
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:41,449
Like just doing the, the, our little group with Alita was so good to be able to collaborate

1168
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,170
with those guys.

1169
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:46,250
And, you know, I had a few side conversations with Brad Johnson around his business that

1170
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,050
he's got at the moment.

1171
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:51,070
And that was really interesting and trying to figure out a way to get him into gladiators.

1172
00:52:51,389 --> 00:52:54,690
Um, which was the show that I was filming at the time, the channel 10, because he's

1173
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,070
got, you know, that protective gear.

1174
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,489
So there's always, I feel like every day presents an opportunity to collaborate, um, with people.

1175
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:04,050
And to me, that's probably where curiosity comes in.

1176
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:05,889
And that's one of my favorite moments ever.

1177
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:09,769
The first time I've seen you lost for words is for even just a second.

1178
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:13,610
I'm glad that, uh, I, uh, I got it.

1179
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,710
It's taken, uh, more than 20 years.

1180
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:16,710
You are a legend, Liz.

1181
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,829
I feel very, uh, grateful to be able to call you a friend.

1182
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:21,349
It's always great to catch up with you.

1183
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:27,010
And, um, it makes me laugh and, uh, great to see that you're going so well as you always

1184
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,349
are, but, uh, maybe better than ever and appreciate you taking the time today.

1185
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:30,949
Thanks Luke.

1186
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,929
Always great to catch up.
