1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,339
It's one thing to lead a team on the right path to winning a premiership

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,519
or building a workplace that encourages growth and sustainability.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,300
But what if your team is an entire city?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How do you generate a positive environment for over 6 million people?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,980
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,480
The idea of self-improvement and leadership,

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,640
both on and off the field, has been a lifelong passion of mine.

8
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,539
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,280
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,460
in education, sport, industry and the arts

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,420
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,880
where everyone has a voice.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,460
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:05,019
I was lucky to be joined by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,260
Leadership is something that she does on a daily basis on a pretty grand scale

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,980
and we discuss the importance of valuing input from others

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,760
and being able to embrace your failures.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,200
Well, this is always an honour and a great privilege to sit down

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,379
with the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and an inspiration in every sense.

20
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,200
Sally Capp, thanks for joining me today, Sal.

21
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,359
Thank you, Luke.

22
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,659
What a lovely introduction.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,980
Well, in terms of your history, we're going to talk a lot about leadership today, Sal.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,299
Your history in leadership is quite extraordinary,

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,900
from the youngest possible age.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,400
Where did you get the drive from?

27
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:43,980
Well, I'm really comfortable in the have-a-go mode.

28
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,000
I know that probably sounds a bit simplistic,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,319
but I've been brought up that way.

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,180
And when you're in have-a-go mode,

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,760
you do appreciate that there are going to be consequences,

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,379
humiliations and embarrassments and failures, frankly.

33
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,980
But if you're comfortable in the have-a-go mode,

34
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,859
it means that you'll keep having a go

35
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,120
and you're not daunted by those situations.

36
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,340
And I think there's a lot about leadership,

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,840
about really stepping into the unknown or the undecided

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,439
or the opaqueness of so many situations.

39
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,520
And let's face it,

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,819
it's rare that you get an easy yes, no, go, stop situation.

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,659
It's really about managing the 49% to 51% situations

42
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,520
where there are pros and cons both ways,

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,120
but you've actually got to step into making a decision.

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,979
And to me, that's a lot to do with leadership.

45
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,919
But what's really helped me is that I'm really comfortable in having a go.

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,520
Can you give me an example, Sal, where we've gone for,

47
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,860
I don't know, but I'm just going to have a go.

48
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:45,919
Yeah.

49
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:46,360
Hmm.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,740
Well, so many, as you've said, and I do get nervous, of course.

51
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,919
One of the things that really stands out for me when I was younger

52
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,979
was my father saying to me, nerves are the sign of a champion.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,080
And it's all about how you channel those nerves, that adrenaline,

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,699
that fear into something better or more positive.

55
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,960
So that was very early advice that I have.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,560
And I think that that's really underpinning of being willing

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,520
to put yourself out there and take risks.

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,819
But even if I think about the decision to run for Lord Mayor,

59
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,340
for example, which has been one of the biggest changes in my life,

60
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:30,319
in my family's life in 2018, and it was very much that sense of passion

61
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,020
and wanting to make a difference and seeing something

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
that I felt I could really add some value to,

63
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,680
but it was really more that I wanted to see change.

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,139
And I had no qualifications in local government.

65
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,340
I'd never really even considered local.

66
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
I didn't consider local government seriously in many

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,460
of the activities I'd had previously, particularly in business.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,539
I hadn't had a lot of interactions.

69
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,659
And again, I've never seriously been involved in policy development.

70
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,580
Or maybe I'm talking myself out of this job at the moment.

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,719
But there were all of these things that go through your mind,

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,259
as well as the taking on public roles like this

73
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:06,819
and putting yourself out there in an election.

74
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,319
It is one of the scariest things I've ever done.

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,379
It's really hard.

76
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,099
And all of those things ran through my mind and my husband Andrew's mind

77
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:15,180
and my family's mind.

78
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,319
And I think that's really important.

79
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,680
We like to do things as a team.

80
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,560
That's always great.

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,800
And ultimately, we made the decision staring at the ceiling

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,339
late on a Sunday night where we just said,

83
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:26,480
this is something we're going to do.

84
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,959
And it was that even with the considerations of all the downside,

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,120
that sense of passion and purpose really driving that decision-making

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,779
to take the risk to go into a situation that seemed quite daunting

87
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,879
and scary at that time.

88
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,180
But knowing that even in having a go, and this was the thing

89
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,439
that unlocked it for us, even in the having a go

90
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,800
and putting up a different proposition for Lord Mayor,

91
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:56,980
somebody that was quite different, that that would make a positive impact,

92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,579
that really unlocked that decision for us and away we went.

93
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, awesome story.

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,379
That's success anyway, whether the outcome is what you wanted,

95
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,040
which you've been elected twice.

96
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,839
No one else as a female Lord Mayor has ever been publicly elected twice.

97
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,660
I just want to go back because I love what you said before,

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,680
you know, the words from your dad.

99
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:14,879
I went,

100
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,620
the great pleasure of meeting too, Brian Capp, and what a legend.

101
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,339
Talk about someone.

102
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,660
I occasionally walk past him outside Kooyong and he's driven

103
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,040
and I can picture him having a go.

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
But nerves are for champions.

105
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,100
I remember hearing the great Tony Lockett,

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,899
who's the greatest goal kicker in the history of AFL,

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,920
and had the pleasure or maybe displeasure of playing against him at one stage.

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,819
And he was so nervous pre-game.

109
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,939
It literally would make him so sick every game.

110
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,079
I think, God, if you're that nervous,

111
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,779
because you scared a lot of people out there, Tony Lockett.

112
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:44,860
He was a fearsome.

113
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,639
He was a fearsome character.

114
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,079
But as you said, if you can harness that energy,

115
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,639
it becomes real positive and it's a power, not a weakness in the end.

116
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:51,920
Yeah.

117
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,180
It's also very humanizing, I think,

118
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,300
to realize that other people are in the same situation.

119
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,480
And mostly now to help me manage my nerves,

120
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,560
I do also reflect that there are many people in the audience

121
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,579
that would empathize with the situation

122
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,980
and would know that I'm feeling that way.

123
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,579
And mostly in my life,

124
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,759
I've found that people want to be supportive

125
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,360
and they want to provide advice and guidance

126
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,939
and they want to share those sorts of situations with you in a positive way.

127
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,939
And I really lean on those thoughts and that energy

128
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,399
to help me manage those fears.

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,800
That might sound quite esoteric,

130
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,399
but I literally can look at the audience

131
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,680
and think a lot of people out there have been in my situation

132
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,019
and they know I'll be feeling nervous

133
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,560
and they will be willing me to be successful.

134
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,160
I might be deluding myself, but that's what I say.

135
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,160
And I really harness that energy as well.

136
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,519
And when I look out at those situations

137
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,699
or even if I'm standing in front of a media pack,

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,019
I really honestly do bring it back to human to human scale

139
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,240
and that really helps me move forward.

140
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,120
You've had so many firsts along the journey

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
and glass ceiling you've smashed through.

142
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,120
It's probably a few concrete ceilings really to think what you've done.

143
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,399
And the first female agent general for Victoria based in London.

144
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,000
And what you did in that role expanded it to other regions.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,360
First female board member of the famous Cullingham Football Club.

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,399
First ever, as we said, publicly elected female Lord Mayor.

147
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:24,639
I love what you said.

148
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,439
Have a go.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,439
I'm going to take this on.

150
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,360
I may be nervous, but there are a lot of firsts.

151
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,519
I mean, when you look back,

152
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,720
how challenging was it to do that so often?

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
Well, I think I don't consciously look for those sorts of opportunities.

154
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,740
And most people would say that.

155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,060
What I'm always looking for are ways to add value

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,100
and to be able to do that.

157
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,680
And gain value.

158
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,379
And I actually look for that in the people that I might employ in my teams

159
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,899
or I might work with in partnership.

160
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,459
Because in any sort of situation,

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,699
you have to have a mutuality to make sure that it really binds

162
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,980
and that you've got that shared purpose and goal.

163
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,420
There has to be a value on both sides.

164
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,540
So for me, I'm always looking at what have I already learnt or done

165
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,199
and that experience that I can feel confident

166
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,300
that it's going to make a difference.

167
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,860
to a role I'm going into.

168
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,040
But also what's new about that that really challenges me

169
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,139
and means that I'm still learning and developing.

170
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,759
And I guess that's part of feeling comfortable

171
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,279
in being outside your comfort zone because I welcome that.

172
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,300
And when it comes to those firsts,

173
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,779
every single one of those times has been that as the underlying element.

174
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,620
And then I also look for not just the one step forward,

175
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,279
but the 10 steps forward, whether that's for me personally,

176
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,960
whether that's for the organisation,

177
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,919
or that's for the role, or in some cases it's been,

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,320
what does it mean for women in leadership as well?

179
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,559
And where you can add those dimensions in,

180
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,500
then that's extra special.

181
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,720
But a big part of it is, firstly, I've had lots of bumps

182
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,419
against the ceiling where it's hurt my head more

183
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:02,980
than I've made much progress.

184
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,940
And two, I know that in taking on those roles,

185
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,659
there are risks and I'm really comfortable with,

186
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,740
I wouldn't say failing, nobody sets out to fail,

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,659
but if I need to be vulnerable in those times to say

188
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,899
that I've never done this before, or this is new,

189
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,860
or it's new for the organisation, or it's a difficult environment,

190
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,159
I'm really comfortable to call those things out.

191
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,200
And again, I think it makes it also easier for the people

192
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,080
around you to respond as well because when you go in as the first,

193
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,399
so I remember that first Collingwood board meeting

194
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,220
in the old Victoria Park social club upstairs in the legendary ballroom

195
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,899
that has a fist punch through one of the walls

196
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,700
and cracks in the glass doors and carpet that your feet stick to

197
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,059
on the way through, you know, the bar area.

198
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,279
And I remember how nervous our fellow board members were as well.

199
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,360
Ed, very welcoming.

200
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,600
But I was new into that culture and also being the first female,

201
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,700
that was something completely different,

202
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,980
not just somebody that was from outside the little group there.

203
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,720
So I remember so distinctly that one

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,000
of the things that was necessary to do was make the other board members

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,940
feel comfortable with me being there and so really putting it out there

206
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,460
that there were many things I didn't know and I was keen to learn,

207
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,139
but here are the things that I thought I was pretty good at

208
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,159
and where I could add value and that immediately gave them a sense

209
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,240
of where I was going to play even if that was initially

210
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,179
and where my focus areas were going to be

211
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,259
and we started up a bit of a common language.

212
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,559
I remember Kevin Rose saying that he'd purposefully,

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,860
reduce the amount of F words he said in the meeting as a result,

214
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,320
all those sorts of fun things.

215
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,840
But you do need to find that equilibrium and being first should be

216
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,179
as good an experience for everybody around you as it is for you,

217
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,799
particularly when you know you're going into something that's new

218
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,659
or uncertain or potentially difficult and really building that rapport

219
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,600
so people can work together is important.

220
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,200
Yeah, and picking up on what you said,

221
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,679
so we're talking a lot about,

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,740
empowering leadership and I love what you said,

223
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,659
it's a value add both ways.

224
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,159
So if you're employing someone in your Lord Mayor's office

225
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,639
or likewise if it's someone who's supporting you on the campaign,

226
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,840
there's got to be a value both ways and I suppose that's something

227
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,679
that we're really passionate about is there is a bit of a shift now

228
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,259
that people are looking to that.

229
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,000
It's not just there's a hierarchy and the old school leadership

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,220
and you would have come up through that with,

231
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,399
I often speak about the big corner office and you know what,

232
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,600
you get your set tasks.

233
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,559
When you haven't got a voice,

234
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,240
do you think that that is the way forward now

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,220
where it generally has to be a collaboration

236
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,139
with the people you work with?

237
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,080
How good is that?

238
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:50,419
Yeah.

239
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,279
I mean, what were we even thinking in the old days?

240
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,259
I remember as a young lawyer going to a meeting

241
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,539
with a senior partner, very senior,

242
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,480
and it wasn't I lucky to be in that meeting

243
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,080
and I'd been asked to prepare for it.

244
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,419
So being diligent, I did that and I read up all the regulations

245
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,460
and I was ready and during the course of that meeting,

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,820
the client asked a question.

247
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,539
And because I'd done all that preparation,

248
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,139
I stepped into the conversation at that point

249
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,240
and I gave an opinion based on my research.

250
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,200
When we got into the lift after that meeting,

251
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,360
the senior partner looked at me with venom and said,

252
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,019
I don't give an F what you think.

253
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,240
Never speak in a meeting.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,059
Wow.

255
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,100
And I was so put back in my place.

256
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,519
Look at me.

257
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm even blushing to think of it because of the emotion of that.

258
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,360
I was definitely being,

259
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,740
put in my place.

260
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,580
No discussion of whether what I'd added to the conversation

261
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,679
was valuable or not.

262
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,960
And I think to the circumstances now where I can play a really big role

263
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,460
in this and that is valuing the input of other people

264
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,700
and knowing that whether it's people with less experience,

265
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,639
so they're bringing new eyes, people with more experience,

266
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,080
or people with different perspectives,

267
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,820
that that diversity of thinking actually gives you a better result,

268
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,440
whether it's internally or externally in your organisation,

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,700
to really embrace that.

270
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,940
Embrace that is powerful.

271
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,100
And it does mean, of course,

272
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,980
that it adds a complexity to your decision-making and your processes.

273
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,700
But from my perspective, that investment has been paid back in spades.

274
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,539
And so it is the new way of going forward.

275
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,179
It's a new way of leading.

276
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,279
It does have some challenges to it, but they're absolutely worthwhile.

277
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,019
How old were you when that happened?

278
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,559
Oh, 22.

279
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,980
So how do you pick yourself up from that?

280
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,120
What did you do next?

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, exactly.

282
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,720
And there were more of those situations as a young lawyer

283
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,379
in that very hierarchical world, particularly, I've got to say,

284
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,059
particularly as a female, than now.

285
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,179
And another great lesson from my parents was,

286
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,139
it's an old adage, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

287
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,759
So just gathering every single one of those experiences

288
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,399
and learning from them.

289
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,899
And even if it was only to build up my own resilience,

290
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,600
because I don't agree with any of that.

291
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,299
Of course, it taught me the sort of leader I didn't want to be.

292
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,019
So there's even value in that.

293
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,700
You can tell I'm an optimist and very positive.

294
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,600
So I'd like to turn it around.

295
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,820
Did I have moments of sheer frustration and anger and emotion?

296
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,679
Yes.

297
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,720
I even had a meeting where I burst out in tears hysterically

298
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,059
in a professional meeting, which was completely inappropriate.

299
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,559
And I picked myself up and walked out and got some tissues

300
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,019
and fixed myself up.

301
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,559
And I...

302
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,559
Went straight back into that meeting room.

303
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,200
So lots of lessons along the way, what I can do better,

304
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,840
how I can be a better person.

305
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,919
And, you know, we all put up with difficult situations

306
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,200
and I think you've got to embrace those challenges

307
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,860
and keep moving forward.

308
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,399
But if we all accept those and we continue them,

309
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,580
then that's terrible.

310
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,899
But if we go through those situations and resolve to do better

311
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,159
as a result of them,

312
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,080
then that's good.

313
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,399
And it's always been one of my...

314
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,759
If you're a have-a-goer, you know you're going to have lots of failures

315
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,659
and make mistakes.

316
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,820
But it's what you learn from those situations

317
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,639
that gives you the 10 steps forward I was talking about earlier.

318
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,340
If you actually take the time to recognise it,

319
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,659
get the value from it and move forward.

320
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,659
It reminds me more recently of a meeting I had with an investor in Israel

321
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,360
where I went to do a pitch and, of course,

322
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
I had a...

323
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,320
I had a slide pack that had all of the brilliant things that I'd done.

324
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,240
It wasn't long, Luke, but, you know,

325
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,080
the slide pack with the things that I had done well

326
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,779
because I was seeking, you know, the support and investment

327
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,840
of this leader, business leader.

328
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,559
And as I started this slide pack, he interrupted me

329
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,639
and he said, now, have you got slides in there

330
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,960
that tell me your five best failures?

331
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,600
I was completely taken aback.

332
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,759
And I said, no, of course I don't.

333
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm here to do the sell job on you.

334
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,360
And he said, well, the sell job for me is for you to tell me

335
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,779
your five best failures and what you learnt from them

336
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:27,700
because that gives me confidence that you can drive deals

337
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,860
and companies forward and when you're faced with challenges

338
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,919
that you've got good experiences and self-awareness

339
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,480
to be able to deal with them.

340
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,580
Has that resonated with me in the years since?

341
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes.

342
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,139
I am.

343
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,779
I absolutely love that and I think more of us should embrace that

344
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,779
because this sense of whether it's tall poppy syndrome

345
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,259
or undermining people because of failures is something

346
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,379
that really holds us back as individuals and as a community

347
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,399
and we need to really push beyond it.

348
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,620
Yeah, and it's unfortunately an Australian thing sometimes,

349
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,019
isn't it?

350
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,779
The tall poppy doesn't resonate when you go to other countries.

351
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:09,940
I always think of the Greg Norman quote he often spoke about,

352
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,980
if you're lucky enough.

353
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,279
If you're successful enough to buy a nice car in America

354
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,559
and I don't like all parts of American culture,

355
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,000
someone's likely to say nice car and he said in Australia,

356
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,140
someone's likely to run their keys down the side of it

357
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,059
and we have got that issue a little bit around how we treat people.

358
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,000
I've got to ask you the question, memorable failures then?

359
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,619
What did you say on the spot then?

360
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,779
Oh, gosh.

361
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,640
What did you go with?

362
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,579
Yeah, so many.

363
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,059
Well, the first one that really came to mind was when I decided

364
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,059
to leave the law and you get to a point where you go,

365
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,299
you're going to keep advising, which has lots of benefits to it,

366
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,200
a lot of variety and intellectual stimulation, et cetera.

367
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,339
You're going to keep advising or you're actually going to go out

368
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:53,720
and have a go at the things you've been advising other people on

369
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,380
in all those years and I decided to make the move and so funny

370
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,980
because when I look back, I realise that in making that move,

371
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,579
I put together a business case, another slide deck.

372
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,640
I walked up and down, you know, the main street to,

373
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,420
meet with lots of potential investors because I needed shareholders,

374
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,900
I needed capital to get this new business going

375
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,240
and I just kept getting no, no, no and what I'd done

376
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,799
with this slide deck is that I assumed a lot of things.

377
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,619
Everybody that I went to visit, of course, I started with the people

378
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,859
that I'd been working with as a lawyer because I felt they knew me

379
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,259
and they knew my skill set and that they would automatically want

380
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,539
to support this new venture of mine and I completely underestimated the fact

381
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:40,619
that I was going to be a lawyer.

382
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:40,700
I was going to be a lawyer.

383
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:40,839
I was going to be a lawyer.

384
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:40,980
I was going to be a lawyer.

385
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,099
I was going to be a lawyer.

386
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:41,119
I was going to be a lawyer.

387
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,819
They knew me as a lawyer but they didn't know me at all

388
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:47,259
as an entrepreneur or somebody that wanted to start up a new,

389
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,819
I called it adventure capital rather than venture because it was so risky.

390
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,559
Was this the private equity business you started?

391
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah, the private equity business.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,619
So I kept getting no's and no's and no's and I had to really go back

393
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:03,640
and rethink and I had a business partner, Tony, and we agreed.

394
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,640
We had to go about it completely differently and that was

395
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,779
to still identify the opportunity but really highlight the risks.

396
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,279
But also talk about what we'd both done in our lives that we felt

397
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,099
could bring success to this new venture and really de-risk us

398
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,119
as a proposition and it's really something I've taken.

399
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,880
It's one of my career rules actually that I've taken forward from then

400
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,079
and that is that I have a responsibility.

401
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,460
Everybody says take risks, take risks.

402
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,039
That's great.

403
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:37,339
But the corollary of that is you've got to find ways

404
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:40,519
of de-risking yourself so that other people can take

405
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,720
a risk with you or take a risk on you.

406
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,640
And so I spend a lot of time now preparing ahead of big decisions

407
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,640
or big interviews that I'm doing or big opportunities I'm pursuing,

408
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,640
looking really across other people's perspectives,

409
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,259
understanding the circumstances and then presenting in a way

410
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,299
that de-risks, whether it's myself or the issue or the proposition.

411
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,799
Yeah, great thoughts, Sam.

412
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,680
I'll tell you a step back.

413
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:10,500
There'll be people listening.

414
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,220
They'll listen to this and they'll say, all right, I understand that

415
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,420
and I understand there were some failures, but Sally Capp's a freak.

416
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,240
You know, she was first-class honours and, you know what,

417
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,079
she might have had a few steps along the way, but she just was something.

418
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,559
How could I ever be like that?

419
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,160
What do you say to young girls and I suppose young boys as well

420
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,839
who might be listening who want to get to the point where they are

421
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,299
in leadership and they can create things that you've done?

422
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
What's the advice you'd give them?

423
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,039
I don't think anyone's called me a freak before, Luke.

424
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,500
So that's a new one.

425
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,240
No, so I'm racking that up as a first.

426
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,599
Term of endearment that was to the Lord.

427
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,220
Yes, no, I get it.

428
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:45,619
Thank you.

429
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah.

430
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:55,380
Look, I really have a very strong work ethic and I share that with lots

431
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,380
of people in my family and around me, including my husband

432
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,420
and what we're doing with our family because it's,

433
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,720
there's the saying, aptitude gives you height but attitude gives you

434
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,420
the pinnacle.

435
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,599
It's something like that.

436
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,740
I've got that completely wrong.

437
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,799
I need Andrew around me.

438
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
But it's really, it's about your attitude, not your aptitude.

439
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,500
It's, you do, you can have talent but unless you apply it and you're

440
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,980
willing to work hard at teasing out all the elements of that and making

441
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,480
it relevant and applicable and achievable, then it's a waste.

442
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,240
And so for me, and I was a diligent student.

443
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,200
I was one of those sucks.

444
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,720
But I was a bit naughty but, you know, my main focus was

445
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,740
on really achieving in that way and yet most of the feedback

446
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,720
from my parents would still be, you know, are you working hard

447
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,319
enough at that?

448
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,339
Was there still something more you could have been doing?

449
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,000
And I guess that still drives me forward, my mum and dad,

450
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,680
Brian and Sherry.

451
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

452
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,779
Like most parents have been a big influence on my life and I do

453
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,900
think that even today.

454
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,519
I mean, I have busy days.

455
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,259
And I'm across lots of issues but I am driven by is there more I could

456
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:21,039
have done and is there something else I could have fit in and could it

457
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,819
have been better?

458
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,400
And a lot of that sense of how it can be better actually comes

459
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,200
from your personal effort.

460
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,339
And so I really encourage everybody that there are no rules.

461
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:37,099
There sort of are no barriers if you're willing to work hard enough.

462
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Now that seems easy to say.

463
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,400
When I sit back looking at my career, which I've absolutely loved

464
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,319
and a very happy, happy family life.

465
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,940
So I've had so many benefits in that way.

466
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:53,720
There's no doubt a lot of fantastic role models and I haven't had

467
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,900
to worry about too much, let's be frank.

468
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,859
But I've also seen through some of those rarer experiences,

469
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,440
some very raw personal experiences, as well as some

470
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,480
of those professional failures that if you stay focused

471
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,180
on what you're doing, you're going to be able to do a lot more.

472
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,619
So if you're still turning up every day, still trying your best

473
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:16,420
and really putting the effort into that hard work and that ethic,

474
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,640
then it's amazing what you can achieve.

475
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,880
Yeah, have a go and then the work.

476
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:23,119
I mean, it sounds simple, isn't it?

477
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,680
But you combine that together.

478
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,940
I did want to touch on the family because to me that is another

479
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,559
amazing element to your story and lucky enough again to have met

480
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,519
the family.

481
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,460
Nicholas is 22.

482
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,039
He's just graduated from Melbourne Uni.

483
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,059
William's at university.

484
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,099
He's at Yale University as the ducks of his school and, you know,

485
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,619
talk about passing on the high achiever gene.

486
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,880
And your husband, Andrew Sutherland, is one of the most extraordinary

487
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,940
people I've ever met in my life.

488
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:50,859
He's the most engaging, passionate.

489
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,599
When you walk out of a, if it's five minutes or 50 minutes,

490
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,220
I feel like you've had your batteries charged up for the rest

491
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,119
of the day being around your husband and you are a great team together.

492
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,640
So how do you get that, you know, I suppose to achieve what you've done

493
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,720
and have the family life at the same time,

494
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,900
you guys have nailed it.

495
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,039
Well, it seems that way.

496
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,420
I know and I think so.

497
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,140
I think so.

498
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,720
But I guess I would say again, you know, when everything seems fantastic

499
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,440
that usually behind the scenes there's an incredible amount of effort

500
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,940
and emotion and dedication and patience and commitment that's gone

501
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,640
into this and it has.

502
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,799
It's been a real juggle and there are some really big decisions

503
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,059
that you make along the way and I think that's another reflection

504
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:37,599
for me.

505
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,779
There have been times when I've really been tormented

506
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,220
about decisions because it's that juggle and that balance

507
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,680
and particularly when you've got children and you want to be able

508
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,339
to spend really great quality time with the kids but you want

509
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,220
to be able to pursue a career as well.

510
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,500
Those sorts of difficult balance decisions come up all of the time

511
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,559
and when I look back, I really feel that where we've gone forward on the basis,

512
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,579
of things that are value-based, that are what's most important to us,

513
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,619
where we've had discussions, Andrew and I, about really what those priorities

514
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:22,980
are at the end of the day, what makes us happy, what brings us joy

515
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,200
and making sure we have that focus on relationships and family,

516
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,400
whether it's family or it's friends as well.

517
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,880
When it comes down to it, they need to be the priority

518
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,279
because they're going to be the most lasting, the most fulfilling,

519
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,000
the most satisfying and I think we've managed that balance pretty well

520
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,680
but there have been some really stressful times when you're considering

521
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,240
what's in front of you and what's the best way forward.

522
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,039
Changing tax cell for a little bit, there's so many areas to go with you

523
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,240
but I'm interested in now you're in this incredible leadership role,

524
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,880
high profile in Melbourne, there's so much that comes your way

525
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,819
but then you've got this element of social media that everyone's got

526
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:13,660
to deal with now too.

527
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,619
And to me, it's a disgrace.

528
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:20,680
Female leaders in particular seem to get absolutely attacked on that basis.

529
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,420
I mean, a lot of people are dealing that every day.

530
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:26,359
Teenage kids, most people have got that.

531
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,500
How do you cope with that?

532
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,900
It's a really good question because being in public roles as well,

533
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,019
so there are two elements here.

534
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,819
Public roles seem to mean that there are no rules even of normal civility

535
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,579
that apply.

536
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:43,940
Yeah.

537
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,019
To people in public roles.

538
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,880
I've found that really confronting and also social media, as you know,

539
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,099
just seems to give permission for people to say anything they want to

540
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:58,420
with absolutely no consequences and that's really disappointing

541
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,119
and more of us need to stand up to say that's unacceptable

542
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,579
and I see more of that sort of conversation and discussion coming through

543
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,460
as we go forward.

544
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,640
Of course, you have to have a very thick skin.

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,359
There's no doubt about that.

546
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,160
And there are times still, and that's where I lean on my team a lot as well,

547
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,680
of sanity checking and support in those moments.

548
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,160
But it does also, and I think the last 12 months have particularly highlighted

549
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,619
this for me, you have to have a resolve if you want to be a leader

550
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,920
and if you want to be involved in these sorts of discussions and debates

551
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,619
and let's face it, there are highlights and there are lowlights

552
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,299
and if you want to be involved in important issues,

553
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,220
and progress in our community, then you really have to be willing

554
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,279
to have that resolve to keep going even when it feels like everybody

555
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,460
around you is telling you that it's wrong or you're doing a bad job,

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,039
criticising, undermining, attacking.

557
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:07,900
You have to have that centre in yourself of that resolve.

558
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,519
Part of that is being willing to admit if you've made a mistake.

559
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,319
I think that's really important.

560
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,359
And part of leadership and having the resolve to do that.

561
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,539
I can tell you I've had to do that and it's tough,

562
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,000
but if you think it's the right thing to do, you must do it.

563
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,220
And same if you think something's the right thing to do

564
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,079
and everybody's telling you it's wrong, then just keep going

565
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,900
because even in doing it, you're making a difference

566
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,119
no matter what the ultimate outcome is.

567
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,680
And so I've become much more focused on that.

568
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,859
But I will say I am a team player

569
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,539
and I think building a team around you

570
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,200
who can have different views to you

571
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,960
but will absolutely stand behind you when needed

572
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,000
and that's both in your personal life

573
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,980
and in professional life is key and absolutely necessary.

574
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,059
I think what you said about owning the mistake that is yours

575
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,700
feels a bit like a lost start in 2021 to me

576
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,960
and particularly I can't understand

577
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,539
and walk in your shoes in political life now,

578
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,880
but there seems to be,

579
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,279
there seems to be that advisors are saying

580
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,680
whatever you do, don't accept responsibility.

581
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,700
Whereas to me, it's the most human thing to do, isn't it?

582
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,960
A disarming thing to do is, and clearly part of your makeup.

583
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,839
Is that going to always stay with you?

584
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,140
Absolutely.

585
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,240
And I think it's a testament to you, Luke, as well.

586
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:32,440
And I do look for other people and leaders that,

587
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,740
to me, that's a standout characteristic.

588
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,000
It's a differentiator.

589
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,859
And I like to work with people.

590
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,819
I like to work with people like that

591
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,519
and learn from people who have that approach.

592
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,259
It's much more relatable.

593
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,220
I think it really drives much more empathy as well

594
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,640
and understanding of what you're going through.

595
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,599
And it's actually one of the toughest things you can do.

596
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,720
So if you do, do it.

597
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,220
But it also creates the environment for other people to do it.

598
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,200
Now, what we find in culture so much

599
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,240
is that deflection or avoidance, distraction or cover-up

600
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,619
because people don't want to admit mistakes.

601
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:10,819
If that's the sort of culture,

602
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,859
you have danger, danger, warning, warning.

603
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,240
Much better to have a culture where people feel comfortable

604
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,279
to call out mistakes or to say sorry

605
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:24,700
or to identify issues and be open to that as well

606
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,680
so that you can keep moving forward.

607
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,220
Because let's face it, we all do it.

608
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,279
It happens every day and it has to.

609
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,279
In the pace and complexity of life these days,

610
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,740
we know that these things are going to happen.

611
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,859
So the sooner you fail and the more open,

612
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,119
you are to mistakes and to moving forward from that,

613
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,900
the more effective you can be.

614
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,140
And I remember actually just back to the campaign

615
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,720
when we set up the first campaign in 2018,

616
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,819
had no idea what we were doing, Andrew and I,

617
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,039
which we worked out in about five minutes.

618
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,319
We set up a team around us to support us

619
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,160
and frankly lead in many ways.

620
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,299
And one of the first things I said is,

621
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:08,759
please know I am going to make a lot of mistakes

622
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,420
because I've never done this before.

623
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,079
And I need you to point those out to me

624
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,880
as quickly as possible so that we can respond to them

625
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,299
and deal with them and move on.

626
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,500
And a wonderful person, Nicole,

627
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,900
who was our campaign manager,

628
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
looked at me and said,

629
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,539
that's the most brilliant thing you could have said

630
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:28,200
because I'll make mistakes too,

631
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,779
even though I've done this many times

632
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:31,799
and so will other team members.

633
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,700
And so it created a very constructive culture,

634
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,319
which we had to form instantly

635
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,099
because we only had three months

636
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,759
to pull the whole thing together.

637
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,059
And it was really set a pace and a momentum

638
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,619
to what we could achieve as a team

639
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,140
because that was one of our underlying principles.

640
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,319
Yeah, I'm really conscious, Bec and I,

641
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,720
parenting-wise as well,

642
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:53,720
is to just occasionally,

643
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,759
more than occasionally as it turns out,

644
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,500
and go, hey, geez, I got that wrong.

645
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,359
And it's pretty disarming for the kids to hear that as well,

646
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:01,599
to look at you and go,

647
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,980
yeah, I think I maybe pulled the wrong rein there

648
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,880
and maybe lost it a little bit on that occasion.

649
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,380
And you're fine, you can then move forward

650
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,460
and allow them to have conversations as well,

651
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,539
being great.

652
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,200
So you don't achieve what you do

653
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,339
and have the family balance,

654
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,059
I'm assuming, without some pretty good rituals

655
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,420
and routines and habits.

656
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,740
Is there anything you can share with us on that front?

657
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,279
What a good question.

658
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,839
Wow.

659
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,799
Routines and habits, very good.

660
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,440
I like to,

661
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,480
I haven't, nobody's asked me that for ages, Luke,

662
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,359
so good one.

663
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,599
I try to be very organised.

664
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,599
So in the chaos of life,

665
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,279
I do really like to have a diary

666
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:40,700
that's,

667
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,119
that's been well thought through

668
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,900
in terms of what's on for the day.

669
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,599
And I rely on other people to help me completely with that.

670
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,500
I like to really stick to time.

671
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,079
I value your time, you value my time.

672
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,920
So I really like to do that.

673
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,960
I find that the more organised you can be

674
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,720
on the things that you can control,

675
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,279
the more receptive and agile you can be

676
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,339
to the things that are beyond your control.

677
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,920
So we really focus on those elements of our lives

678
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,220
that we can control personally and professionally.

679
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,940
And then that sets us up for,

680
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,660
for the unexpected and unpredictable things

681
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,619
that happen in life.

682
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:22,440
We always have people that can catch the balls

683
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,980
that we might have missed.

684
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,680
And that's been absolutely key,

685
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:29,220
particularly for juggling family and profession.

686
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,319
So I have been so lucky with family,

687
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,819
my parents-in-law, my parents,

688
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,059
sisters-in-law particularly,

689
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,400
and my siblings to know that there are people

690
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,279
that can catch the balls.

691
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:40,319
And I think that's a really good thing.

692
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:40,400
And I think that's a really good thing.

693
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,539
And I think that's a really good thing.

694
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:40,680
And I think that's a really good thing.

695
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,599
And even in primary school,

696
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,779
when I was really working so hard

697
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,579
to get that career moving to the next level,

698
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,539
to know that I could rely on other mums,

699
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,279
I was straight out to other mums to say,

700
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,940
hey, I'm going to need your help.

701
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,079
And the great thing when I said that,

702
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,759
and the perfect one was first day of school

703
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,660
for young Will, we dropped him off in the morning

704
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,700
and all organised to pick him up at the gate at 3.15.

705
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,800
But I got the call at 12.15 from the school

706
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,519
to say, your son is going to be in school

707
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,599
and your son, Will's here.

708
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,599
He's the only child still here.

709
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,739
And I said, what do you mean?

710
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,880
And they said, the first day is a half day.

711
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,380
So I completely dropped the ball

712
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,420
and knowing that somebody could be there

713
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
to help in those urgent situations.

714
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,679
You've got to know, and it's the same in your team.

715
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,460
You've just got to know that you've got each other's back

716
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,440
to be able to step into those situations.

717
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,099
But the routines is very much around feeling organised

718
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,760
on the things that you can control.

719
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,099
We've been talking,

720
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,940
a lot about in the work I've been doing

721
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,719
about the dimensions of what makes a great leader.

722
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,280
So what does self-leadership mean to you?

723
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,420
Self-leadership means accountability.

724
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,500
And I mean that in a very positive way.

725
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,239
Another word that a lot of people don't necessarily like,

726
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,280
but is discipline.

727
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,599
And I really like to have discipline.

728
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,659
Having said that, and maybe it really plays

729
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,079
on the discussion we've just had,

730
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,380
is that I like to be spontaneous.

731
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,960
I like to be a little bit crazy at times.

732
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,400
Hard to believe, Luke, I know.

733
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:19,420
I like to be a little bit naughty,

734
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,500
whatever naughty is for me.

735
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,159
And you've got to allow yourself those moments

736
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:28,420
to let off steam and be yourself.

737
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,239
And so that's important for me.

738
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,639
To me, that comes back to the maybe overused term,

739
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,900
but it is about authenticity.

740
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,039
If you are,

741
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,019
not being true to yourself,

742
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
and in doing that,

743
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,460
allowing other people to see the true you,

744
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,099
then not only letting yourself down,

745
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,460
because who wants to live a life with the stress

746
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,639
of trying to be something that you're not,

747
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,019
but you are letting everyone down around you.

748
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,460
And the richness of life experiences

749
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,019
comes from being open to that.

750
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,539
So being vulnerable.

751
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,920
To me, vulnerability is powerful,

752
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,940
and to being completely authentic.

753
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,300
And that means that you can have failures and humiliations,

754
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,639
but you can also be there for the triumphs and the accolades.

755
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,619
They go hand in hand.

756
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,699
And I don't ever intend to live a one-dimensional life.

757
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,599
And so really bringing all of that to the fore

758
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,539
is important to me.

759
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,599
But I do have those sense of discipline and accountability,

760
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,019
particularly in my interactions with other people.

761
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,400
Beautifully said.

762
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,019
I'm interested in what the naughty Lord Mayor does.

763
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,579
I won't go there,

764
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,659
but I can see that spark in your eyes.

765
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,920
I know you do like a good time when the opportunity provides.

766
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,539
How do you think about positively impacting others in your environment?

767
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,019
It's a really good point.

768
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,760
And I think one we should all explore more

769
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,400
because you can have a positive impact in a very purposeful way.

770
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,239
So when you,

771
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,920
you decide and you determine that there are ways

772
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,320
in which you can use your powers and influence

773
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,079
to be supportive and make a positive impact on other people.

774
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,460
And I think in many ways,

775
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:25,219
that's the more obvious and easier thing to do.

776
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,699
And I do take time to think about that.

777
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,820
But what we should be more sensitive to,

778
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,900
I think, is the way that you can have positive influences

779
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
that the coincidence,

780
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,960
the dental or the unintended

781
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,420
or the things you're not necessarily conscious of.

782
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,039
And the reason they're more difficult

783
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:46,039
is because they happen in moments

784
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,739
where you're not deliberately thinking about it.

785
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,659
It's, it's, it's your, your aura.

786
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,519
Let's say it's your halo.

787
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,699
It's, it's the unconscious everyday things

788
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:00,539
that can make such a difference.

789
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:03,280
And one of them for me is the word, thank you.

790
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,880
Yeah.

791
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,260
And I know I've just said they're the,

792
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,219
they're the sort of more unconscious,

793
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:08,880
conscious moments.

794
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,739
If it becomes so much of,

795
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
of an ingrained part of what you do to be grateful

796
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,340
and to say thank you,

797
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,880
then that they're the little things

798
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,119
that can happen every day

799
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,940
that can make a positive influence,

800
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,519
can be positive on people's lives,

801
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,019
to be grateful for the value that they're adding.

802
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,380
One of the most humbling experiences for me last year

803
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,940
was when I would come into work

804
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,280
because I got to go to work every day,

805
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,739
which was, was great for me

806
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:37,900
to see the teams getting organized in the morning

807
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,840
to go out and clean our city.

808
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,820
And they were people that had been chefs at the MCG

809
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,599
or had been front of house

810
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,820
in one of our magnificent theaters

811
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,460
who had found themselves out of work

812
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,260
and ineligible for other support.

813
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,940
Who said, I will put myself forward as a city cleaner.

814
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,139
And that in doing that,

815
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,619
they were also helping our community

816
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,000
in such an amazing way.

817
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,739
Very humbling for me.

818
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,619
They had a positive influence on me at the same time.

819
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,639
As us organizing those programs

820
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,840
to be able to provide that support for people

821
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,519
who needed work and a sense of team

822
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,119
and a sense of purpose in, you know,

823
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,159
one of the most extreme situations

824
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,139
we've gone through in our lifetime.

825
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,219
So it goes both ways.

826
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,300
And I think being deliberate

827
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,579
about how you have influence is important,

828
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,480
but also being mindful of it's the other moments

829
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,199
that can make just as much of a difference.

830
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,099
Yeah, what a great story.

831
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,800
I wasn't aware that that happened

832
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,880
in the city of Melbourne,

833
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,739
that people actually volunteered

834
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,099
to repurpose themselves and clean the city.

835
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,179
How do you think about creating

836
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,820
and sharing your vision, Sal,

837
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,760
with the team you work with?

838
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:49,960
Oh gosh, that's everything

839
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,199
from using the complete force

840
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,239
of my personality and passion

841
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,199
to see things through

842
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,159
to being conscious of

843
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,219
how do you actually galvanize

844
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,159
and motivate people behind something

845
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,960
that is an outcome of yours,

846
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,719
an objective or a project.

847
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,139
And I think inclusiveness is really important.

848
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,860
I think a lot of times

849
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,059
when I was coming up as a young worker,

850
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,079
leaders would only try and tell you

851
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,599
the good bits of what was coming up

852
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,739
and not so much talk about the more challenging

853
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:25,320
or difficult or complex parts.

854
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,320
And even today,

855
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,599
I think people respond with such cynicism

856
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,599
if you don't give them the full story

857
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,300
or you try to deflect.

858
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,639
So I think in terms of building teams,

859
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,739
it's important that people

860
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,480
can see the full spectrum

861
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,820
of what's coming up,

862
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,000
that you share the detail

863
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,079
of what's going to be challenging

864
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,260
as much as what's going to be positive and fun

865
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,920
and that you get that input

866
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,780
into projects early

867
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,380
so there's a sense of ownership

868
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,860
over not just the outcome

869
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,940
but also the process

870
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,300
on how we're going to get there,

871
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:00,900
that those elements are really important.

872
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,980
And it's something you've reminded me actually

873
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,820
in this conversation

874
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,260
that I don't do enough of

875
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,840
and that is really celebrating

876
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,559
at the end of the day.

877
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:07,619
And I think that's really important.

878
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:07,719
And I think that's really important.

879
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,079
At the end and reflecting back on the team

880
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,800
because the pace at which we all work these days,

881
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,800
it's so easy to move on to the next thing.

882
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,460
And we do need to find those spaces

883
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,760
to celebrate and to give feedback.

884
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,239
And I receive feedback as a gift.

885
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,900
Can you imagine how much feedback

886
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
I get in this role?

887
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:28,760
It's a lot.

888
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,860
And I mostly receive it as a gift

889
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,739
if people have felt so incensed

890
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:36,780
or passionate about something

891
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,579
that they're actually

892
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,480
contacted me to give me that feedback.

893
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,440
I take that on board.

894
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,659
I might not use all of it,

895
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,739
but certainly I take it as a gift

896
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,539
and I want to give feedback

897
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,039
as a gift as well.

898
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,980
And if we think of cultures

899
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,860
and conversations

900
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,800
that we challenge each other to improve,

901
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,960
then that really turns the paradigm

902
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,219
on how we interact around

903
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,079
giving constructive or negative feedback

904
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,099
as much as positive.

905
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,539
I love the way you frame that.

906
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,139
It's just, you know, feedback's a gift.

907
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,519
You know,

908
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,340
receiving it and delivering it.

909
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,579
It's such a better way to think about,

910
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,760
you know,

911
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,059
for what some people find

912
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:15,199
the hardest thing, isn't it?

913
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,239
You know, because it's still

914
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,099
always challenging, isn't it?

915
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,539
You know, it might be a gift,

916
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,699
but sometimes you're not sure

917
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:21,639
you want to unwrap it right away.

918
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,880
And I love what you just said

919
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,559
about celebrating as well.

920
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:25,980
And I often think a lot of my analogies

921
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,960
come from the sporting world.

922
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:29,219
So as a fanatical Collingwood

923
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,820
former board member,

924
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,199
you'll appreciate this.

925
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,480
Nathan Buckley is one of the greatest

926
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,599
players at your club ever

927
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,940
and a great person.

928
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,500
I think there's a quote

929
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:37,920
from him.

930
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,179
He might've even written in his book

931
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,099
that he didn't enjoy

932
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,440
one moment of his career

933
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,000
because he was told all the way along

934
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
until he won a premiership,

935
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,820
he couldn't enjoy it,

936
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:45,659
couldn't celebrate.

937
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,599
It's one of the saddest things I've ever,

938
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,239
this is a guy who achieved more in sport,

939
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,179
is a great person,

940
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,780
a great leader.

941
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:53,739
And then I saw firsthand in 2016

942
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,519
with the club that I play,

943
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:56,099
Luke Beveridge,

944
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,239
just changing that paradigm.

945
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,900
Every time something good happens,

946
00:42:59,059 --> 00:42:59,619
let's celebrate.

947
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,599
And they were dancing and partying

948
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,679
and all the old school people in media,

949
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,079
you know, crusty old people like me,

950
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,179
you can't do that.

951
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,920
You know, like it's,

952
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,119
you know,

953
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,460
and the fun and the momentum that created

954
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,860
was the best.

955
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,539
And they, you know,

956
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,260
really broken that stereotype,

957
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,480
which has got to be a good thing.

958
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,000
Communicating with clarity,

959
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:17,519
so how do you approach that?

960
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,340
Communications, absolutely fundamental.

961
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:26,159
And the communicating with clarity,

962
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,760
I think is a lot to do

963
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,400
with simplifying messages

964
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,019
so that it really goes to the heart

965
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:36,860
of what,

966
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,480
you want to,

967
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,260
you want people to hear, frankly,

968
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,639
and to understand from it.

969
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,400
Now, I'm a lawyer.

970
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,239
I love words.

971
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,960
This has been a tough one for me.

972
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,599
And even now,

973
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,320
I get a lot of feedback about my answers,

974
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,519
sort of dancing around the topic

975
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,139
until I actually get to the point.

976
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,920
So this is a development area for me.

977
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,480
But I think the other part of this,

978
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,920
apart from the simplicity

979
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,420
and really getting to the point,

980
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,480
is to think of other people's perspectives.

981
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,619
Because what we say

982
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:10,960
isn't necessarily what people hear.

983
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,800
And if we put effort

984
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,320
into other people's perspectives,

985
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,780
what will they be looking for?

986
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,579
What will they be wanting to hear?

987
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,639
Or what is the element of your message

988
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,519
that is of most interest to them?

989
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,599
It may be that you actually change

990
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:27,519
that communication,

991
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,320
and you should for different audiences.

992
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,599
It may be that instead of doing

993
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,679
one big message to a whole lot of people,

994
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,599
you chunk it down

995
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,760
and you make the effort

996
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,099
to actually get to the point.

997
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,679
You actually go around to smaller groups.

998
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,860
It can mean more time

999
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,900
and it's more of a commitment.

1000
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,599
But actually,

1001
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,719
if you're focused on getting the message to them

1002
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,000
and frankly receiving also the feedback,

1003
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,380
then putting that effort in is important.

1004
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,639
So I think communicating with clarity

1005
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:57,380
is about simplicity of message

1006
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,280
and getting to the point.

1007
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,679
But it's also about thinking of the audience

1008
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:01,880
and their perspectives

1009
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,860
and being as prepared as possible

1010
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,099
to deliver it in a way

1011
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,980
that they hear what you want.

1012
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:07,820
That's what I'm trying to say.

1013
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:08,760
Well said.

1014
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:09,900
Collaboration,

1015
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,420
I know it's a huge part of you

1016
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,960
and what you do.

1017
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,280
Do you think about it consciously?

1018
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,340
How do you incorporate it every day?

1019
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,719
I'm naturally a collaborator.

1020
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,579
I love people

1021
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:26,199
and I love spending time with people.

1022
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,000
And I can come out of a conversation

1023
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,599
and people say,

1024
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,760
oh gosh, that was so difficult.

1025
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,780
And I think, I loved that conversation.

1026
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,340
That was terrific.

1027
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,079
And I really value difference

1028
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:36,880
and the contribution.

1029
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,380
But I've also seen the absolute support

1030
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,420
that comes from collaboration as well.

1031
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,840
We've talked about a lot of those themes today.

1032
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,000
And I think that people underrate collaboration,

1033
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,980
coordination, cooperation,

1034
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:53,420
all of those words,

1035
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,099
because sometimes it's just easier

1036
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,179
to get on and do it.

1037
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,840
But a lot to do with preparation.

1038
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:03,079
How key is preparation

1039
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:05,639
to the success of the final outcome?

1040
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,079
To me,

1041
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,780
preparation, it goes to that being organised

1042
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,840
and that sense of discipline and accountability.

1043
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:13,880
The more prep you can do,

1044
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,940
not always possible,

1045
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,340
but the more prep you can do for me

1046
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,840
includes that collaboration.

1047
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,340
Who are the stakeholders?

1048
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,420
How are we involving them?

1049
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:25,380
How have we embraced and communicated with them?

1050
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,900
What level of knowledge do they have?

1051
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,380
What level of action would be required?

1052
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,059
And how can we get everybody on board

1053
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:35,679
from the earliest steps possible

1054
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:36,780
is,

1055
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,699
a really big part of creating

1056
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:40,760
that foundation for success.

1057
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,579
And as you know,

1058
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,000
the stronger and the broader

1059
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,719
and the deeper that foundation,

1060
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,699
the bigger platform you have to leap forward.

1061
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,579
So to me,

1062
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,360
collaboration is one of those key elements,

1063
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,920
sort of in everything,

1064
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,539
infused in everything these days.

1065
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,019
One of the great things about social media

1066
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,460
is you can reach out

1067
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,380
in all sorts of different ways.

1068
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,519
But to me,

1069
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,980
it goes to one of those essential elements

1070
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,920
of preparation for success

1071
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,900
is collaboration.

1072
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,940
Final question, Sal,

1073
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,760
and we value your time enormously

1074
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,300
and really appreciate you being so generous today.

1075
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,460
If you're thinking of a leader in your life

1076
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,760
who's been the greatest inspiration,

1077
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,639
can you name one?

1078
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:18,420
I've mentioned my parents a lot, et cetera,

1079
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,460
but somebody else who's been an absolute leader,

1080
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,340
and I've been so lucky to have her

1081
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,420
as part of my personal life as well,

1082
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,539
is my aunt, Ros Kelly,

1083
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,760
who was one of the first women into federal parliament,

1084
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,820
who was one of the first women

1085
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,599
to break the ceiling about becoming a minister,

1086
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,280
to sit around the cabinet table,

1087
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,599
who was actually the first woman

1088
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,099
sitting in parliament.

1089
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,780
She wasn't literally sitting in parliament,

1090
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,980
but a sitting member of parliament

1091
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,039
to have a baby

1092
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,079
and everything that that meant.

1093
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:52,199
And somebody who has stepped into

1094
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:54,860
really big issues like climate change

1095
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,500
way back in the 80s and 90s

1096
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,639
and stayed dedicated to issues like that

1097
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,199
throughout her life following politics

1098
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,260
and has still made time for friends and family

1099
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:06,920
with the strength,

1100
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,880
the strength of relationships

1101
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,639
that have endured decades.

1102
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,400
Ros has been somebody I really admire.

1103
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,239
She's had an amazing impact on my life,

1104
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,880
but also on many others

1105
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,380
as a leader in her professional career

1106
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,719
and somebody who's had a big personal impact

1107
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:25,920
on lots of people.

1108
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,500
So I feel really lucky

1109
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,179
to have had somebody like that in my life.

1110
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,639
And do you still run things past her today?

1111
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,639
Oh, yes, of course.

1112
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,380
I mean, she would say,

1113
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,159
she can't believe I didn't get into,

1114
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:39,340
even though it's local government,

1115
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,940
local government politics sooner,

1116
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,260
given the sort of influence

1117
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,139
she's been on my life.

1118
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:46,059
But I've also saw firsthand

1119
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,940
when I was much younger,

1120
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,539
the toll that public life can take on people.

1121
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:54,360
And she really put in a massive effort to that.

1122
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,659
But Ros was one of the first people I called

1123
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:58,940
when considering the Lord Mayor role, for example.

1124
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:02,360
And I actually rang thinking she'd say,

1125
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,900
you've got to be joking.

1126
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,219
But when I rang her to put,

1127
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:07,340
this idea to her,

1128
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,719
she said, absolutely, positively, go for it.

1129
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,679
And it's that sort of positive energy

1130
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:16,019
and passion that she's had on me.

1131
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,820
I picture the 22-year-old lawyer in the lift

1132
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,239
with the senior partner telling you to be quiet.

1133
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,039
And I just think, you know,

1134
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:25,619
the impact you are having on so many people

1135
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,019
and sharing what you're sharing today,

1136
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:29,019
the change and that shift around,

1137
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,760
it just is going to impact so many people's lives.

1138
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,440
So thank you so much for sharing your wisdom.

1139
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,599
And it's always an inspiration to speak to you.

1140
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,019
Thanks again.

1141
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:36,699
Thanks, Luke.
