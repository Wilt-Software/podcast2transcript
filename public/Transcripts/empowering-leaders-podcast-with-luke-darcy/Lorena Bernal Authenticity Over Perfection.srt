1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:10,630
It was hard for me, but at the same time, it was a gift to be exposed to so many different

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:18,449
worlds, South American culture and way of life, and also Hollywood with all the limelights

3
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:26,850
and also elite sports athletes with my husband's world, but also moms in different schools.

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,229
I had the privilege to find out who I really was and not losing myself, no matter where

5
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:33,710
I was.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,649
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

7
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,289
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

9
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,770
backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture, and the arts who come together to learn, to

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,729
connect, and to collaborate.

11
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,090
Kirsten King, founder of Fluidform Pilates.

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,429
It's been amazing.

13
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,710
Here you are on this Zoom call.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,130
Feeling within the first...

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,489
First session, like you intimately know these people and care for them, and then all of

16
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,709
a sudden realizing that even though you're in totally different industries, we're all

17
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:18,329
going through the same thing, or we've been through it and we can help each other, or

18
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,890
there's just this hurdle that you can't see past, and then you share it with the group

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,469
and there's five answers in 40 minutes, and you think, I have not slept for two weeks

20
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,409
thinking about that.

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,109
Like, how is this possible?

22
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,510
Craig McRae, senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club.

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,609
You're listening to stories and the breadcrumbs of what makes success, and I constantly get

24
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:46,430
something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups, because we're all living the same stuff, aren't

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:46,549
we?

26
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,909
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,609
What happens there is magical.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,989

Welcome to today's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast, where we're joined by the

38
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,830
inspiring Lorena Bernal.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,650
A woman whose grace, talent, and entrepreneurial spirit have captivated people across the globe.

40
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,150
With a rich background in television and film, Lorena has brought unforgettable characters

41
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,430
to life in hit series like CSI Miami, Chuck, and NCIS, where her on-screen presence has

42
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,650
left lasting impressions.

43
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,349
Beyond acting, she's graced the covers of top international magazines, from Elle to

44
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,849
Marie Claire, celebrated not just for her beauty, but for the intelligence and purpose

45
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,490
she brings to every endeavour.

46
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,810
Today, Lorena is a member of the Empowering Leaders podcast, and she's been a member of

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:02,849
the Empowering Leaders podcast for over a decade.

48
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,110
Lorena is channelling her passion into Live Love Better, a transformative lifestyle brand

49
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,789
and movement dedicated to empowering women to lead more intentional, connected lives.

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,949
With a focus on self-growth, mindful relationships, and holistic wellbeing, her work is helping

51
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,710
thousands redefine what it means to live fully and love fearlessly.

52
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,490
As acclaimed designer Carolina Herrera once said of Lorena, she's elegance with a mission.

53
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,669
Every step she takes leaves behind a mark of meaning.

54
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,789
Her family heritage is as diverse as her community.

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,409
Her career spanning from American, Indigenous, to Croatian, Italian, and Spanish roots.

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,930
Born in Argentina, raised in Spain, and educated in France, Lorena is a mother to three boys

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,710
who she shares with her husband, Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta.

58
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,990
Lorena, that's a pretty full life that you've lived.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,590
Yes, yes, that's a whole life, yes.

60
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,750
I read doing some research for today, and I can see the passion that you have for helping

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,030
people to be the best version of themselves.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,189
What, to you, is the secret to living?

63
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,569
Healthy and happy, successful life?

64
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:13,189
I think the secret is to discover who you are in your heart, what you want, what you

65
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:20,149
can bring to the table, and being authentic to that, being fearless to being yourself,

66
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:29,370
and go for the life you are meant to live without comparing it to anyone else's, without

67
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,129
comparing the ways to anyone else's.

68
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:32,189
Yes.

69
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,209
Yes.

70
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:32,230
Yes.

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,250
Yes.

72
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,269
Yes.

73
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:32,290
Yes.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,350
Yes.

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,370
Yes.

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,389
Yes.

77
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:32,410
Yes.

78
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:32,430
Yes.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,449
Yes.

80
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:32,470
Yes.

81
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,490
Yes.

82
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,509
Yes.

83
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:32,569
Yes.

84
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,310
Yes.

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,329
Yes.

86
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:41,370
Being you, doing you, authentic to your passion, your talent, your call, and that way, I think

87
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,569
you can live the most amazing life, because every single bit of it will be authentic and

88
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,189
true, and will be of service of anyone else.

89
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,970
Lorena, people, I'm sure, will watch this, and they'll listen to it, and they'll see

90
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,129
supermodel, and entrepreneur, and mother of three, and a life coach, and they'll see this

91
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:02,430
perfect life.

92
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,709
life but we know that everyone's got to do some work on themselves as you said to be the best

93
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,790
version of you can you share with us what are the things that you've had to do to try and be the

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:19,769
person you are I kind of what you just said the best version of yourself I I don't really like

95
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:29,430
that concept I I like the concept of being the authentic version of yourself not the best

96
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,790
because if you are all the time trying to be the best it will never be achieved but once you are

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,889
authentic you can relax you can let go and you can just do you and be you and in my case I think

98
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:55,670
with my life I I discovered that because I had to really know who I was since I've been in so many

99
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,410
different worlds with different people

100
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,310
countries religions languages different social classes as well

101
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:15,029
that I always had to find out who I was in that context and the context normally would change so

102
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:22,610
I had to rediscover who I was in that new environment so it was hard for me but at the

103
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:29,410
same time it was a gift to be exposed to so many different worlds a South American culture

104
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:38,829
and and way of life and and also Hollywood with all the limelights and also elite sports athletes

105
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:49,149
with my husband's world but also moms in different schools in different countries in different kind

106
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:57,310
of schools so I had the privilege to live in very different environments with very different people

107
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,389
and I had the privilege to live in very different environments with very different people and I had

108
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:08,430
to instead of lose myself and adapt to whatever world I was being exposed to I had the privilege to find

109
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:17,350
out who I really was and not losing myself no matter where I was and that is I think what gave me

110
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:26,629
that knowledge or that aha moment that is like okay so just being you whatever you are with

111
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,550
whoever you are that's the key

112
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:37,350
Because you are with yourself, you know your story, you trust you and you can do whatever

113
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:44,670
you want, wherever you are, with whoever you are and you are you and you enjoy life

114
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,889
without fear and with confidence.

115
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,930
So that is what I mostly learned in my life so far.

116
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,870
It's a great distinction you make between the best version and the authentic version

117
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,290
of you.

118
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,230
And as we often say, it's hard enough to try to be someone else all the time.

119
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,949
As you said, it's a tiring life to live to try and be someone for someone else.

120
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,769
So that authentic version of you, what does that look like, you turning up as you?

121
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,589
Me, myself personally?

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,170
Yeah.

123
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,449
I love life.

124
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:25,990
My authentic self really enjoys my senses, my body, my skin, what I see, what I hear.

125
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,269
I love...

126
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,029
I love the sun, the rain, the trees.

127
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:31,209
I love people.

128
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,370
I love a hug.

129
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:43,830
It's like I feel as if I was an entity that went into a human body with a life experience

130
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,570
on earth.

131
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,909
And I'm enthusiastic about everything I live around me.

132
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,190
Like I love it.

133
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,289
Even the struggles, the problems, the bad feelings or the bad emotions.

134
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,190
Or like I...

135
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,429
I find it fascinating.

136
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:03,730
I am fascinated by human beings and by our planet.

137
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,830
So that's the me I carry with me all the time.

138
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:13,389
I mean, the hard part is to be truth to...

139
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,970
I mean, in my case, no, that's me.

140
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:23,929
But I cannot sometimes show that enthusiasm or that curiosity authentically all the time.

141
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,929
It's not easy because not everyone is the same.

142
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,889
So that's the work to do.

143
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:37,669
To get to be yourself, even if the others are not, to live your way.

144
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,070
That's interesting.

145
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,490
And so the point you finished on, what a beautiful way to live your life too.

146
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,269
The way you described it.

147
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:47,870
I can see the smile that comes out and love everything, the struggles and the challenges.

148
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,529
But you sort of at the end said, if you're with people who are inauthentic or people who

149
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,710
are not being themselves, is that where you find it most challenging?

150
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,690
That the people you're surrounded with sometimes maybe aren't living the life the way that

151
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,289
you would want to live?

152
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,970
Is that the challenge?

153
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:11,149
In my case, those are the moments that I find the most fascinating because I know I can

154
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,929
in some way plant seeds on them and inspire them.

155
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:24,549
I live being myself even more when I'm with that kind of people with an intention, I think,

156
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,549
of showing them, hey, you can...

157
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,129
I can also be authentic and enjoy where we are.

158
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:38,049
You don't need to have that mask or that insecurity or that judging, comparing all the time.

159
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:43,870
You can just let go of all that and be here with me and enjoy this.

160
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,009
Look, I am with no mask, so just take it off.

161
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,110
So it's a challenge, but I'm not also attached to the result.

162
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,649
Like, I'm not being myself for you to be yourself.

163
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,690
I'm just being myself because that's the way I learned to live.

164
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:07,669
But it's great to see you in front of me removing that mask because by me not having a mask,

165
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:15,429
I'm kind of allowing you to remove it as well and interact from your you and my me.

166
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,169
And magic happens, really magic happens, and I love that.

167
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,750
You're also an author.

168
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,129
It's a brilliant book called It Starts With You.

169
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,169
And you talk about...

170
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,210
In fact, that we're closer to happiness than many people think, that it's an inside job,

171
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,509
to paraphrase some of the language.

172
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,350
Can you explain a bit more on that, that everything within us is there to achieve happiness?

173
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:45,269
When you realize you are a person inside of you, in your heart, right?

174
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:52,250
Like the same person, the same essence that you were when you were a kid, and you are

175
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,429
curious for life and you enjoy life, but then little by little, you grow up.

176
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,110
And you start putting all those masks and you start thinking you're not enough, you're

177
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,429
not good enough, so you need to be better, right?

178
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:09,750
Because everyone is telling you you are not good enough because everyone is teaching you

179
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,429
how to be.

180
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,669
Your parents, society, your teachers at school.

181
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,309
So the message is you're not good.

182
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,450
You need to learn how to be good.

183
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:25,070
So you start kind of learning, trying to learn how to be good, and you forget that you were

184
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,429
already amazing.

185
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:27,370
Right?

186
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,250
When you're a kid.

187
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:31,169
So that little kid is still in you.

188
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:37,190
That little kid that is curious for life, that enjoys every day, that wants to jump

189
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,850
instead of walk, that wants to scream, shout, move.

190
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,169
It's still inside of you.

191
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:51,149
So if you discover that and you connect with that you, then you're happy.

192
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,830
Like there's no other option.

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,549
Because you are...

194
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:05,830
You are filling life with your heart instead of be thinking constantly logically or worrying

195
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,450
or planning or trying to be better.

196
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,230
So you are immediately happy and in peace.

197
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,590
And suddenly you discover, oh, yeah, it's me.

198
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,950
And then you live your life.

199
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,129
So it's not about changing your life.

200
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:26,509
It's about connecting to your truth, to who you are, and then living your life.

201
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,549
And from there, yes, you can start making changes if some things in your life doesn't

202
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:39,950
don't work or you don't like them, but not to be happy, but because you are already happy

203
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,210
and then you live your life as you want.

204
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:48,909
So that's what I'm trying to guide you towards with the book.

205
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,610
Lorena, we see most people and most of us get very attached to our jobs and our titles

206
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,129
or our income.

207
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,389
And our appearance or a lot of external things.

208
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:05,190
And you write a lot about the happiness being an inside job.

209
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,830
But for people, that is a hard thing to understand.

210
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,090
How do you think true connection happens?

211
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,809
Because it seems a lot is at the superficial level.

212
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,009
But you talk about true connection.

213
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,169
What do you mean by that?

214
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:26,389
If we take the job thing, the career, if you do a job or you go into a career and you're

215
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:35,409
looking for success in that career from a place of I need this to be better, I need

216
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:44,029
this to be happy, I need that success to show everyone else that I can be better or that

217
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,250
I can be good or to show myself or to show my parents or to show the world.

218
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,470
If you do all that from there, looking for success, validation.

219
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:02,509
Applause, fulfillment, then nothing will ever be enough.

220
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,870
There will always be something else to chase or to find.

221
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:17,149
But if you connect with your real call, that is what I what I need to do in this journey, in this

222
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:24,350
life that we only have one, by the way, right, so we make we need to make sure we make the most of

223
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,889
it and that we are truth.

224
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,389
Because.

225
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,350
To to ourselves, because we just have one ticket, one journey.

226
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:38,570
So if you let your heart tell you, OK, this is what you are here to do, or these are your talents or

227
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:47,490
these are the things that really make you lose track of time and enjoy and expand yourself.

228
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:53,929
And and when you're doing them, you trust yourself completely because there's a knowing inside that

229
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,309
you know what you're doing and you want to.

230
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:02,149
Show everyone not for them to applaud you, but to give them who you are.

231
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:08,070
If you do a career or a job from there connected to that.

232
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:18,309
Then success is every single day is in the expansion you feel while you are doing what you're doing, no matter

233
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:26,330
what the results are or what others think, but then the doing in the every day, that's the success that is the.

234
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,210
The real connection to yourself.

235
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:36,090
So there's no fear, there's no weight in your shoulders, there's no disconnection from your

236
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,090
personal life because you need to focus on your job that a lot of people that they're scared of.

237
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:49,970
Now, if I lose focus and I and I put my focus on my kids or my wife or my parents or my personal life, then

238
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,149
I'm going to lose track of what I have to do.

239
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,330
And I'm so attached to the success I need to to get that.

240
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,409
I cannot let go.

241
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:06,349
And a lot of struggle come if you don't come from that authenticity or from that connection to your truth.

242
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,309
I recorded an interview with Dr.

243
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:13,890
Pippa Grange, who's written a book about fearless and that sums up a lot of what you just said.

244
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:21,529
She talks about winning deep as opposed to winning shallow and that expansion and the joy of living without fear, as you described.

245
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,049
So many layers to what you do.

246
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,009
And I've introduced a few of them as an actor and an entrepreneur.

247
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,430
And I'm curious, as a mother of three, how would you describe yourself as a mother?

248
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,069
I've changed a lot.

249
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:55,190
I always tell my my eldest, he's almost 16, like you had the most unconscious mother, you know, like I would I started mothering from what I knew that was my parents or the few things I witnessed, you know.

250
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,150
But then.

251
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:08,769
And since then, with the things he taught me and with the things I learned about myself as a mother, I've evolved completely in in all these 16 years.

252
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:15,670
And then with my second, I was a completely different mom and with my with my third child as well, a completely different mom.

253
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,769
So today I am a mom that is.

254
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,150
I would say almost completely detached.

255
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,890
Of who they will become.

256
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,470
I it's not my thing to plan who they will be.

257
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:50,089
And it's really like it gave me a lot of freedom because you're not trying to carve a sculpture and make something, but you're just allowing them to to find out who they are and what they want to do.

258
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:56,089
I have no idea of what will bring them success in terms of job or.

259
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,509
Or career or or or country to live or or anything.

260
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:18,970
What I know as a fact is that what will bring them happiness is to find out who they are and live from who they are without comparing them to my friends, kids or other kids or what it is supposed to be the right thing to do or.

261
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,650
So I allow them to be I I admire their way of living because it's fascinating.

262
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:42,470
It's fascinating how they they see life without worrying about anything like they they don't worry, which is great because like they they they know there's a problem or there's an obstacle or whatever, but they don't worry.

263
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,809
They don't overthink that.

264
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,589
And it's I learned every day from them the joy they have.

265
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,509
They play constantly anywhere in a hospital, in a lift, in a funeral.

266
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,730
They just play.

267
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,329
And I love that.

268
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,130
And I try to to learn from them.

269
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,890
So I became a little bit of an observer.

270
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,849
And a learner.

271
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:14,190
And I just make sure that I teach them the rules in the society we are in.

272
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:18,789
Like I need to make sure they know, OK, here you can play or whatever.

273
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,569
But these are the the rules we all need to follow.

274
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,630
Not because you're going to be a better person.

275
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,390
If you do them, but because you need to live around other people and these are the rules.

276
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:44,250
OK, so once you know the rules and do you and enjoy your life and that's how I mother and I enjoy it a lot, a lot more than that.

277
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:55,250
I would enjoy it maybe years ago when I wanted to be a good mom and I wanted them to learn and I would compare them to an ideal of.

278
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,369
Of the best of anything.

279
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:12,170
So it's quite relieving and and and I'm enjoying every single day and I know it will go so fast because my eldest is already 16 and he's already starting to live his independent life.

280
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:24,509
So I know it's just a little bit of time, a few years where you have a jewel of of of a person next to you to teach you what life is really about.

281
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,470
So that.

282
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,609
That's how I take it.

283
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,430
Beautiful way to to bring the boys up.

284
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:43,750
You mentioned before about the diverse life that you've lived and given the profile of of where you are in London, you can find yourself at the palace having dinner with Prince William or hanging out with, you know, fascinating people around the world.

285
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:51,170
Has there ever been a moment, Lorena, you thought, wow, I can't believe I'm sitting in this chair tonight or is there a moment that springs to mind?

286
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,809
Yes, many, many.

287
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:59,589
It's as I said, I get fascinated by by by every experience we have.

288
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,430
I don't take anything for granted.

289
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,890
And I guess like to be having dinner next to Prince William is it's it's amazing.

290
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:16,490
It's a it's a privilege and to live in London and to to be able to travel or to be it's not just next to Prince William.

291
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,890
It's also to be in a beach cooking some barbecue at night under the moon.

292
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:23,769
Like.

293
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,849
It's wow.

294
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,529
It's amazing.

295
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,390
So to be able to have all those moments.

296
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:32,670
Yeah, I'm that all the time, all the time.

297
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:50,829
I sometimes when when I get some stressful moments or or I'm overwhelmed for something, I always think, well, the other option would be to have like a normal life in one city without moving, without doing so many things.

298
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,269
And I wouldn't like that.

299
00:22:53,269 --> 00:23:00,170
That simple life, it wouldn't be for me because I want the juice of every every bit of life.

300
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,769
So I remind myself that this is a life you choose and you want and you enjoy.

301
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,529
So I said, OK, let's go for it.

302
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,970
We all are born different.

303
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:19,809
As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks uniquely our own.

304
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,069
Charting our life's course.

305
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:29,759
No one sees an idea, opinion or opportunity like you.

306
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:33,079
And no one sees you like VU.

307
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,380
Victoria University.

308
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,359
Uniquely you.

309
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,039
My name is VU.

310
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
I study territory preparation.

311
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,160
I was born in Iraq.

312
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,519
We had to move from Iraq when I was six years old because of the war.

313
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,180
When we went to Jordan, we just applied for a visa to come to Australia.

314
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:51,859
Thank God we got it.

315
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,720
And we came here and I'm loving this offer.

316
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:03,559
So the course on studying gives me the opportunity to study many other pathways and it gives me the opportunity to choose whatever I want.

317
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,559
It opens so many places for me.

318
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,079
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect, is something we're really passionate and proud of.

319
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:17,960
We bring together groups of five to six people around the globe from diverse backgrounds, sport, industry, social venture and the arts.

320
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,779
We come together to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

321
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:21,920
Liz Ellis.

322
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,660
Australian netball icon and televisionist.

323
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,380
The thing that I've loved about it is not just the meetings that we have with our group.

324
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,519
It's the thinking that you do for days and days afterwards.

325
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,240
Someone says something and it sparks a thought and within my sport and within women's sport,

326
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,519
I'm just someone who I try to lead by keeping people talking about the issues.

327
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,339
There's times when I think the person I'm trying to convince is not listening to me.

328
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,359
It actually got me thinking about this is how I need to address my communication with them.

329
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,740
So it was, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

330
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,259
We're really excited.

331
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,859
A collaboration between our world of Alita, of connecting where we think you're inspiring people around the globe with your passion for live life better.

332
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:06,460
And in September coming together in London, super exciting.

333
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,539
Can you tell us about how that connection happened from your perspective?

334
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:21,380
Yes, I love working with leaders and successful people that have people to lead in any world.

335
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,559
I really want to collaborate.

336
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,380
I really want to collaborate in showing them what I said before.

337
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,059
First of all, hey, you just have one life.

338
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,640
Okay, so relax.

339
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,880
Second, make sure you balance your work life with your personal life.

340
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:53,619
Because if your personal life is not stable and fine and nice, then it's very hard to enjoy your work life, no matter how successful you are.

341
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:53,680
Okay.

342
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:02,019
So I see many people or companies or experiences helping that balance enough.

343
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,680
So I want to bring that to the table.

344
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:23,059
And also help them to make sure they enjoy what they're doing as a human being, nor as a machine, as a robot that does things with data in their brain and goals and results.

345
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,380
And they work for that.

346
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,420
And I think that's the most important thing.

347
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,599
And I think that's the most important thing.

348
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,019
I have a heart.

349
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:27,759
I have a body.

350
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,579
I breathe.

351
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,319
I need to rest.

352
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,460
I'm a human being with all the imperfection that make a human being amazing.

353
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:48,500
So in the conference, we're bringing a few specialists that will show these leaders how to take care of themselves as human beings as well.

354
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,460
And I think the mix of leadership and well-being.

355
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,500
As a whole, it's beautiful.

356
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,519
And I'm very excited to collaborate and to bring that to the table.

357
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:16,400
Because I've seen some magic happening in leaders that were amazing in what they were doing, but they were maybe missing something inside to remind them that, first of all, you're human.

358
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,799
You're imperfect.

359
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,200
You don't need to thrive for perfection because that's not you.

360
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,519
Enjoy all those imperfections.

361
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:36,339
And enjoy all those moments where you realize you're a human being and you need to love as well and to allow yourself to be loved and enjoy life.

362
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:51,819
You don't want to get when you are 90 with an amazing company or an amazing success, but alone with no love and leave this life without having really lived it.

363
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,460
So that's what we're bringing.

364
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,579
That's what we're going to try to bring to the conference.

365
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:07,599
We picked amazing specialists that will bring a lot of knowledge and a lot of soul and heart to all the talks in the conference.

366
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,980
It's going to be really, really nice.

367
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,980
Come and join Lorena in London in September.

368
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,160
And as you said, some amazing speakers in here.

369
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
Lorena's passion come out.

370
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,000
Super excited to be there.

371
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,400
Mikel, your partner, and Steve Kerr are going to be on stage as some amazing contributors.

372
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,319
So we'll give you some more details and check that out.

373
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:36,660
I wanted to follow on and ask you, I think the stress and the crazy pressure on an English Premier League coach might be more than any other people on the planet.

374
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:42,059
They seem to get scrutiny at a level that very few have to deal with.

375
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,319
How do you handle that, Lorena, as a family to see that sort of pressure every day?

376
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,319
I mean, first of all, I see the pressure my husband has is mainly from himself.

377
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,980
The maximum pressure he feels is what he demands of himself.

378
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,019
It's not really what others or the press or the fans demand of him.

379
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,039
I don't feel that pressure.

380
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:18,599
Me as a wife, I try to have our family just living and enjoying our lives without pressure.

381
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,960
Like whatever happens will happen.

382
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,160
And I just try to enjoy.

383
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,819
And to help him, my husband, enjoy our life and enjoy the moment.

384
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,119
And even the hardest match they will play with the hardest situation because, I don't know, injuries or they need the result or whatever.

385
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:49,619
I see it as fascinating and amazing and really a gift to play at that level.

386
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,099
And I try to remind us that all the time.

387
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,880
It's a privilege that is really a gift.

388
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,180
So, yes, work on it and work hard.

389
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:10,640
But don't forget inside to enjoy because it's not forever and it will end at some point.

390
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:20,400
And it's a shame if you haven't enjoyed all this that comes with being a Premier League manager at this level in London, in the Premier League.

391
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,920
It's beautiful.

392
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,740
It's really something unique.

393
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,200
I try to enjoy and I try my kids and my husband to enjoy too.

394
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,039
But he's very demanding on himself and very hard worker.

395
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,440
So, it's an everyday job to remind him to enjoy.

396
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,059
That's a great perspective, isn't it?

397
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,259
To see that the joy is there, isn't it?

398
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,700
The pressure is a bit of a privilege to be in that role.

399
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,599
And you say that in such a beautiful way.

400
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,400
I want to ask you also, I know you're passionate about mindfulness and meditation.

401
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:53,960
Can you explain?

402
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,880
Explain why that means so much to you?

403
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:06,240
Well, mindfulness is the title they've given to the capacity of being present in the moment.

404
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,099
It can be called mindfulness or it can be called just being peace in the moment.

405
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,599
And meditation, it's one way of connecting to the present moment.

406
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,279
I don't do meditation myself.

407
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,000
But mindfulness, I think.

408
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,759
And I don't like to say the word because I feel it as a title, as some kind of trend.

409
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,299
But it's how we need to call it so we all understand what we're talking about.

410
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,859
And it's just about being present.

411
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:47,579
And the only way of being present is being connected to your heart.

412
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,579
Because if we live from the mind, from the brain, we are constantly in the moment.

413
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:03,079
In the past, retelling ourselves the stories of what didn't work or fears of things that happened before.

414
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,799
Or we are in the future.

415
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,880
What we want to achieve, what we are chasing.

416
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,140
And we forget to live because the only way of living is being in the present.

417
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,400
Is being in the now, here, enjoying this moment and living this moment.

418
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,400
And when you are present in this moment, suddenly the past and the future just dissipate.

419
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
They're not there.

420
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,039
They only come when you think of them.

421
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,500
But if you don't think and you just feel and are, then you are in peace.

422
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,059
It's immediate.

423
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,039
The peace comes and suddenly you are here.

424
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:44,380
Instead of people constantly in the future.

425
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,039
Constantly.

426
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,200
What I need to do.

427
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,240
What I need to achieve.

428
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,039
What I need to plan in order to be what.

429
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,000
I always say, what are we chasing?

430
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,539
Like the final, the finish line is the same for everyone.

431
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,500
And they don't give you a trophy.

432
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,079
There's no one there waiting for you with a medal.

433
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,059
And then you start living.

434
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,359
No, no, no.

435
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,039
It's not like that.

436
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,660
Finish line is game over for everyone.

437
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,059
So what are you rushing for?

438
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,299
What are you chasing?

439
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Enjoy here, now, this moment.

440
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,400
Because it will never come back.

441
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,980
So if you live like that, every single moment.

442
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,880
In your life.

443
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,500
Every single present moment becomes a thing because it becomes really a huge moment.

444
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,220
So you expand your life.

445
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,339
Now we're talking a lot about longevity and stuff.

446
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,759
But you don't want to expand a life that is narrow and thin and longer.

447
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,460
You want it wider.

448
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,099
You want an expansion now.

449
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,660
No matter how many more years.

450
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,859
But you want every day to be.

451
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,000
Amazing.

452
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,119
In whatever you're doing.

453
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,859
Even if you are in pain or in a moment, in a situation you're not liking.

454
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,019
Make that make sense.

455
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,920
And make that a learning moment.

456
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:13,239
Or find the collateral love in that pain or in that moment.

457
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,460
So that is, for me, mindfulness.

458
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,320
And that is what I'm trying to coach or to teach and to model to others, too.

459
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,280
Lorena, have you got a story you can share?

460
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,860
A vision?

461
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,880
A vision?

462
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:23,920
A vision?

463
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,960
A vision?

464
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,099
A visionary leader that has inspired you and you felt compelled to follow their vision?

465
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:37,139
I heard once Quentin Tarantino, the film director, say that he's not necessarily the best in all these things.

466
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,599
Like lighting or music or acting.

467
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,179
But he's the best at communicating his vision.

468
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:53,420
So he's good at telling them how he sees things and picking the right people to make it happen.

469
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,760
So he was saying that that's his expertise.

470
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,199
And I loved that.

471
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,099
And it's real.

472
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:08,599
Because when you have a director that tells you exactly what he's seeing, then you can bring what you have and adapt it to make that vision a reality.

473
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:22,920
So I think in every area, a leader that has a vision and that vision comes from their passion, then they are able to express it.

474
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:30,980
In a very enthusiastic way and trusting that that vision will create magic.

475
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:40,039
And then you catch the attention of others and you make others to be an amazing help for that vision.

476
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,460
And they want to make that vision come into reality.

477
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:48,360
I think that's an amazing way to lead others.

478
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,599
I heard you talk about your curiosity a few times in this conversation.

479
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,840
How does that curiosity show up for you?

480
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:59,139
And how do you then integrate some of that into your life?

481
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,519
Curiosity?

482
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,099
I have curiosity, especially for human beings' emotions.

483
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:13,179
Like I want to know all the time how they feel, why they're doing this, why are they expressing this.

484
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,000
I don't know.

485
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:20,800
If some driver on the road is yelling at me, for example, I go, oh, gosh.

486
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,340
Maybe it's because they had a bad day.

487
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,400
Maybe it's because they had a bad day.

488
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,460
Maybe it's because they had a bad day.

489
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,579
Maybe it's because they had a bad day.

490
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:29,980
Or maybe, what can be going on in their head to be yelling at me like that in this moment?

491
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:36,760
So instead of reacting to the yelling, I go into the curious mode.

492
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:48,079
It's like, what makes a person getting so angry in such a quick moment for some detail of, I don't know, I have stopped in what I needed.

493
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,239
I didn't have to stop or something like that.

494
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,440
So I'm curious all the time.

495
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:00,679
I'm curious all the time about how people interact, how people express themselves, how they talk, where they come from.

496
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:07,300
And at the same time, I'm getting data, data, and I observe all the time.

497
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:17,679
When I was younger, I used to give my opinion all the time because it was something that came to me naturally, this observation of others.

498
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:20,059
So I was observing everyone.

499
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,860
So I had a lot of data.

500
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,840
And I would give my opinion and I would try to teach.

501
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,579
When I was a kid, I got in trouble with a lot of friends because it's like no one asked you.

502
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,840
I said, okay, okay.

503
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,980
So I learned my lesson and I soon, early on, I learned not to give my opinion if they don't ask me, but to observe.

504
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,860
That curiosity and that observation never stopped.

505
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:51,840
That's why, one of the reasons I became a coach, when someone really want my advice or my opinion or my view.

506
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,099
That's why, one of the reasons I became a coach, when someone really want my advice or my view.

507
00:37:52,099 --> 00:38:00,659
To be allowed to tell them and to help them to have a broader vision of whatever they're going through.

508
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,559
Because that's how I see life.

509
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,719
I observe and I'm curious all the time.

510
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,380
Lorena, we're a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration and what happens when you bring inspiring people together in our world of elite.

511
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,900
Have you got an example of a great collaboration in your life?

512
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,079
What comes to my mind is all the time that I've been grateful.

513
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,980
Or what someone else has said or done unexpectedly.

514
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,300
And it was maybe the piece I was missing or the answer I was looking for.

515
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:44,260
Sometimes it's someone you expect to know more than you and to give you advice because they're experts and they tell you things.

516
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,679
Not always it works because sometimes they are in a different frequency than you.

517
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,780
But sometimes...

518
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:58,480
Sometimes people you don't even realize you are having a conversation and they say something and it's like,

519
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,059
Oh my God, this is the answer I was looking for.

520
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,559
This is the missing piece.

521
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:12,739
And I learned a long time ago to open my eyes and my ears and my senses to every person.

522
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:20,099
Because they might not know they're giving you precious advice or answers.

523
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:21,639
But...

524
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:30,360
But everyone has the potential to give you something valuable in collaboration.

525
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:45,400
And at the same time, you might be bringing them or giving them also some jewels, some pieces of advice or modeling some ways of living that really is life changing for them.

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,780
When you are only yourself with your expertise, with your knowledge.

527
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,480
I think...

528
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,260
I think you can get only to some places with limits.

529
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:11,559
But when you open yourself to receive what others can bring to the table without judging, I mean, there's no limits if we collaborate between each other's, each other views, each other experiences.

530
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:18,019
As I said, we all have clues and jewels to bring success to others.

531
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,960
Lorena, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

532
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,699
Okay, I have a lot of answers that came to my mind right now.

533
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,340
One answer, I'm not religious at all, okay?

534
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,199
But one answer would be Jesus.

535
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,639
And I'm not religious.

536
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,639
But when I was a kid, I was raised in...

537
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,039
My grandparents were religious and my parents too.

538
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:50,940
And there's a kind of leadership that he had that was so gentle, so trusting.

539
00:40:50,940 --> 00:41:02,840
He was so loving, so generous, so detached to the results or the outcome.

540
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,199
And so that leadership is really an example I love.

541
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,179
And that was present when I was young because they were religious.

542
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,639
So that's a leadership I would love everyone to have.

543
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,300
Like if you ask me how you would like leaders to be,

544
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,000
I would say like that.

545
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,780
Another leader I have in my life every day is my husband.

546
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,380
He's an amazing leader.

547
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,920
He doesn't lead me, let's say,

548
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:37,219
but in his way of leading in his area, he's amazing.

549
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,019
He's amazing.

550
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,460
I see his passion, his love for what he's doing,

551
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:45,820
his connection to every single person he works with.

552
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,820
From the gardener that makes the grass of the field,

553
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,000
he makes the field amazing.

554
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,840
He loves the gardener and he loves the kit man and the CEO.

555
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,360
Like he has a connection with every single person.

556
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,599
And he's fearless and he's passionate and he loves what he's doing.

557
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,760
So that's a leadership I really admire as well.

558
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,099
Another leader I had in my life was my dad.

559
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:17,199
His leadership came from...

560
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,179
And I understood this

561
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:20,199
when I was an adult.

562
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:27,519
His leadership came from not wanting his life to be repeated in his children.

563
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,039
So we came to Spain from Argentina.

564
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,739
They decided they wanted a better future for their kids.

565
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:46,199
And my dad was the leader in that move, in that what school we would go to, the messages he would raise my brother and me with.

566
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:54,300
So it was an amazing leadership because he empowered myself and my brother to believe we can achieve whatever we wanted.

567
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,500
If I learned something from him is the leadership, but also what I don't want to lead with.

568
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:10,980
It was some kind of fear, fear that if he didn't succeed in what he was trying to do, he was scared of that.

569
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,000
So the way that comes out from fear.

570
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:25,460
Of not succeeding in what you're doing, sometimes it's not the right way the kids, in this case, will get the message.

571
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:36,159
They will have to maybe remove the layers and understand the intention behind the way you were leading them.

572
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:42,760
So he made me learn as well that you cannot lead from fear because it doesn't always work.

573
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,639
So those are the three answers I'm throwing there.

574
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,980
And that is an amazing answer from Jesus to Mikel, your husband and your dad.

575
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:52,940
What a great thought.

576
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,179
That's a fascinating way to think.

577
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,659
Final question, Loretta, been great to spend some time with you.

578
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,639
Again, I'm going back to this passion we have for collaboration.

579
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,880
And you can see the passion for you and the way that you lead your life.

580
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,380
And it's been full of diverse interests and around the globe.

581
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,199
Has there been anyone you thought, well, I'd love to collaborate with them?

582
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,019
It could be from any of your passions, from acting days.

583
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,940
Or from Live Love Better.

584
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,440
Or is there anyone, is there a name that springs to mind that you've thought,

585
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,199
that'd be a great person to collaborate with?

586
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,179
I don't have one person.

587
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,280
I mean, obviously, when I was in Hollywood, I would have loved, I don't know,

588
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,760
Spielberg to call me or things like that.

589
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:41,980
But in reality, in my essence, I just pray every day for having the opportunity

590
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,000
to collaborate with people.

591
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,639
That.

592
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:48,619
Are amazing in what they're doing.

593
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,400
And they live what they're doing from their hearts.

594
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,699
I love being around those people because they inspire me.

595
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,139
They teach me a lot.

596
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,579
There are so many things I don't know and that I'm really bad at.

597
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,099
And you need to learn them because it's part of, I don't know, now with my company,

598
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:15,920
Live Love Better, I'm good at some things, but I'm really bad at others.

599
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,960
But a company needs all the legs, right?

600
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,940
Or in acting, I love acting, but I also love producing, script writing.

601
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,920
So to be around people that are amazing in the areas I'm not good at,

602
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:40,960
and they enjoy doing those things, and they really have a call in their hearts

603
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,099
for doing them, I love being around them and learn from them.

604
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:45,940
Because it's...

605
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:49,280
It's really inspiring and I love learning.

606
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,400
And sometimes, as I said, it's people you randomly meet,

607
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,820
that they are amazing in, I don't know, in something.

608
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:05,019
And I would be with them like for hours asking questions and learning from them.

609
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,460
I think you can learn a lot deep and quick if you are with someone

610
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,179
that really lives what they're doing and are excellent.

611
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:18,800
And they're experts in their essence in what they're doing.

612
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,119
So those collaborations are fascinating for me.

613
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,380
And Lorena, on that note, we are super excited to collaborate with you

614
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,139
in London in September and we'll send out some more information

615
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:30,000
how you can come and join.

616
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,119
Lorena, I'd encourage you, if you want to hear more, go and purchase

617
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:36,400
It Starts With You, Lorena's brilliant book.

618
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,519
It's a great guide to the authentic life that Lorena's talking about,

619
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,420
living without fear, living from your heart.

620
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,900
I certainly learned a lot today.

621
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,679
So from our conversation, it's great to spend some time with you.

622
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,679
I really, really appreciate it.

623
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:50,079
Thanks, Lorena.

624
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:51,260
Thank you.

625
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,159
Thank you so much.

626
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:54,519
I'm looking forward to see you in person in September.
