1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,939
How do you bring empathy, care and vulnerability into the elite sporting world of the AFL,

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,179
which has been dominated by alpha males and old school mentality, to change the way we

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,660
now think about coaching forever?

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:20,899
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,699
The idea of self-improvement and leadership, both on and off the field, has been a lifelong

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,559
passion of mine.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,600
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective, and I've had the privilege

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,159
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts, that have helped

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,799
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership, where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,359
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:01:03,189
In 2016, Luke Beveridge coached the Western Bulldogs in the AFL to their second premiership

12
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,489
in the club's history, ending a 62-year drought.

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,969
He has twice been recognised by his peers as the Outstanding Coach of the Year in 2015

14
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,150
and 2016.

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,969
Last season, 2021, he coached the Bulldogs to just their fourth grand final in close

16
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:19,489
to 100 years in the VFL-AFL competition.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,849
His playing career extended over a decade and more than 100 AFL games.

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,010
Luke Beveridge is universally respected for his sense of purpose, his vision and his leadership.

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,069
Bevo, it's always great to spend time with you.

20
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,049
Thanks for joining me on the podcast.

21
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,230
It's a pleasure, Dars.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,890
Thanks for having me today.

23
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,409
Now, Bevo, I feel fortunate enough that I crossed over with you for a few years in the

24
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,209
early 90s.

25
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,129
That's the start of my career.

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,950
And you'd been drafted from the Melbourne Football Club to our club.

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,530
And I don't think I've had this conversation with you, but I wanted to start here because

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,709
there are a couple of moments that have always stayed with me from the impact you had on

29
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,890
me as an 18 or 17 or 18-year-old at that stage.

30
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,069
And this sense of presence I always felt you had.

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,170
And there's two moments that I thought of in preparation for this chat.

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,110
There was a time, and I don't know if you remember this, but first-year player, you

33
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,270
think you're ready to play.

34
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,210
You're not getting a game.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,509
I remember being really down.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,990
I was thinking that perhaps that wasn't an opportunity that I was going to be able to

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,330
fulfill.

38
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,129
And you came and sat next to me and you just said, hey, mate, you're going to be a really

39
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:20,569
good player.

40
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,349
In fact, you're going to have a great career and you're going to be fine.

41
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,669
And I remember thinking, geez, how did he come to know that that was a time I really

42
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:28,129
needed that?

43
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,270
There were more senior players and guys that had been around.

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,830
And there was a second occasion.

45
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,250
We won a reserve grand final that year, one of those years, you might remember.

46
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,090
And I remember at the end of one night, late at night, I had a couple, might have been

47
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,770
carrying on a bit.

48
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,270
I was in a round with the coach and you grabbed me and said, hey, mate, you're better than

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,449
that.

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,409
And you sort of pulled me aside.

51
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,389
I remember, and it stuck with me, I'm thinking, not many people at 2.30 in the morning have

52
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:54,250
the presence to have a conversation like you did.

53
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,930
And it stayed with me for a long time.

54
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:57,509
Do you remember having that presence?

55
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,449
Do you remember having that impact on people even in the early days of your career?

56
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,629
I think I might have remembered you looking at me like you wanted to snot me that night

57
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,349
when I pulled you.

58
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,129
I don't think we were probably in the right state to be being too serious.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,909
I'm not too serious about life, but I think, you know, the journey that I was on and some

60
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,969
of the struggles that I'd had probably in the early parts of my career and learning

61
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:30,710
to persist and persevere and probably being on the edge a lot of the time, I think I understood

62
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,909
what some players were thinking and what they were going through.

63
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,689
It was a daily and weekly emotional rollercoaster.

64
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,129
And I don't really remember.

65
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:48,689
You know, not many of my ex-teammates have ever said to me, like you just did, and I

66
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,490
really appreciate that.

67
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,090
It means a lot to me to us, that I had an influence because maybe I reached out.

68
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,889
But I like to think that, I think, you know, obviously we're going to be talking a little

69
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,409
bit about leadership, you know, today, but I like to think that I always looked at outside

70
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,810
of my own sphere and thought about other people's emotions and what they were feeling.

71
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,009
And for me,

72
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:18,009
I think that's where really powerful, impactful leadership starts.

73
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,569
You know, that's always been my belief.

74
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,009
I've always, you know, trying to describe you or summing up Bevo is almost the impossible

75
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,009
task.

76
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:31,129
And I don't know if you sense that as well, but to me, you've always had this great emotion,

77
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,610
great connection, great empathy for people.

78
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,750
And perhaps those stories that I shared before are evidence of that.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,509
You always, it always felt to me like you were thinking about how other people were

80
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:41,509
going at any particular time.

81
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,009
Yeah.

82
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,790
And how they were going at any particular stage and a great love for people.

83
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,889
You know, I use that word love on purpose because not many people in our era would have

84
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,209
felt that way, but you also, if you cross the line with you Bevo, there's a line and

85
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:59,430
you can be pretty direct when that line's crossed and maybe even a little bit brutal

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,170
when that's the case.

87
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,629
Is that a fair way to describe it?

88
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:04,629
Yeah, maybe.

89
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:08,889
I think my default is to love and care for people first.

90
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,889
I give people chances.

91
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:21,189
If there are accidents or unintentional outcomes where people's best intentions were there.

92
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:26,170
But I must admit, I don't give people many chances when the early read is that they're

93
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,810
not a good person or that they're selfish and they won't hesitate to do wrong by people

94
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,810
around them.

95
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,290
I don't tolerate that.

96
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,769
And unfortunately, I think what happens is 99% of the time, you're a good person and

97
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:51,149
you're a caring person who wants to help others whenever you can and on the odd occasion

98
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:57,490
where maybe there's some emotion and it is a bit edgy, that's sometimes what you're remembered

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,490
for.

100
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,709
And I'm sensitive around that because it's still a part of me and in what I do now, I've

101
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:07,069
got to be really careful that there's no controversy.

102
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,069
Yeah, it's a fascinating insight, Bevo.

103
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,069
I mean, to me.

104
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:18,449
I think that's as great a part of you as any part, the care and the love comes out.

105
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,709
But I love the fact that people around you know exactly where they stand and always have

106
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,709
done.

107
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:29,069
I think even from that really young age, knowing you at that time, you could stand pretty clearly

108
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,170
on where you're still with Luke Beveridge.

109
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,889
Is that something that you try and soften a bit when you get older or it's just that's

110
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,629
your DNA and that's who you are?

111
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,790
I think I've matured like all of us.

112
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,790
You know?

113
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,569
I've made myself a little bit better.

114
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,670
I'm fortunate that I've been lucky in life, you know, in different stages of my life.

115
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:56,129
I've worked hard and not just in my working life, but in my relationships with my family.

116
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,930
I've had stability.

117
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,370
I'm fortunate in many, many ways.

118
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,430
And I don't think I was, I think I believe I was a later mature.

119
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,430
I had that.

120
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
I had that.

121
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,430
I had that.

122
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,430
I had that.

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,430
I had that.

124
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,430
I had that for quite a while.

125
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,509
But my personality was probably a little bit volatile for too long.

126
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:21,290
And probably until, you know, into my early 30s, I think that was when I really came around

127
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,750
and coaching really helped me with that.

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,769
Because you're not only technically and tactically in control of something, you're a manager

129
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:36,550
and you've got to make sure that the human resource and what you're trying to achieve

130
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,310
with managing personalities and emotions is on point.

131
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,490
And that hastened, I think, my maturity at that point in time.

132
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,290
But it was a bit late.

133
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,829
You know, I wish I was like that in my early 20s.

134
00:07:49,170 --> 00:08:00,129
And I definitely cared for you, Luke, and my teammates and everyone that I've ever played with and been involved with in sport.

135
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:08,329
But I think in totality, I didn't grow up enough, you know, in my 20s.

136
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:16,670
And you think that sort of volatility, which is pretty common for young competitive, you know, players, alpha males, I think we all had that.

137
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,050
I can put my hand up and, you know, hopefully soften as you get older as well.

138
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,470
But part of it was probably needed in that environment as well, do you think?

139
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,949
But you look back and think, God, if I had a better handle on that like I did in my 30s, I might have had better outcomes earlier, is it?

140
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,230
Yeah, possibly.

141
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:38,309
There's no doubt that when you reflect, there's sliding doors moments in your life and in your career where, at times,

142
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,789
you say your football career could be over.

143
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:55,090
I always used to think if I got suspended, my position at any of the clubs I played with wasn't secure enough to endure too many things that were undisciplined.

144
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:05,210
I feel like I played the game hard enough, but I really, as far as being disciplined in the game, I was pretty good away from it at times.

145
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,149
As far as a confrontational aspect, I wasn't.

146
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,309
So.

147
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,629
So good.

148
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:20,470
But I think I, because I was so sensitive to that, I generally made good decisions to prolong my career and sustain what I was doing.

149
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:31,830
Could I have handled and managed relationships, especially managing up and, you know, with coaches and out?

150
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,870
Definitely.

151
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,269
You know, because I just, I wasn't mature enough in my thinking to understand.

152
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,750
You know, where they were coming from at times.

153
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,370
But I've really got no regrets with any of that.

154
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:56,090
I just, I just feel like if I understood my surrounds and my environment better, and I didn't spend enough time to do that.

155
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,330
Yeah, it's an interesting reflection.

156
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,889
I want to come back to some of that, Bevo, because I'm fascinated by your thoughts on that.

157
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:07,429
But I wanted to change tack and jump into a story that you've spoken about, but to me is still under.

158
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,289
And I think it's a good thing that you're saying that you're a senior coach.

159
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,210
And I think it's a good thing that you're a senior coach.

160
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,230
I think it's a good thing that you're a senior coach.

161
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,250
I think it's a good thing that you're a senior coach.

162
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,250
What you achieved at your old football club, St.

163
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:18,210
Bede's, Mentone, in the three premierships in a row, never done before in Australian rules.

164
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:22,129
Never done before in Australian sport, really, to take a team from C grade.

165
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,169
You went back to your old club.

166
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,230
You're an assistant coach.

167
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,529
They got relegated to C grade.

168
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:27,990
You win the grand final.

169
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,629
It was your first year as senior coach in C grade.

170
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:36,029
Tell me it's one of the great grand finals in football history, 47 points down, and you pull off a remarkable victory.

171
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,230
You're playing at that stage and have a massive.

172
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:48,809
You go to B grade and win, and then the team goes to A grade and wins the A grade against the side that the collegians, they told me, were on paper the far superior team.

173
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,049
It beat you by 100 points only two weeks earlier.

174
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,710
And we're talking about you doing that with almost the same players.

175
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,870
Eight played in all three, but you didn't go and pay money and recruit better standard players from AFL.

176
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,570
It is truly a remarkable sporting story in every sense.

177
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,210
When you look back on it, what are your memories and what do you think?

178
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:23,710
Yeah, my overriding thought is always how grateful I was for guys like Matt Beasley, the president, and those eight players that played in all three who just totally committed to what we were trying to do on and off the field.

179
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:33,009
And all the volunteers and helpers around the football club, that is always my overriding sense and feeling.

180
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:36,169
I'm really grateful for, in particular, the players.

181
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,009
Because they've essentially...

182
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,350
Provided the opportunity that I've had at AFL level and where my coaching has gone.

183
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,149
And I never lose sight of that.

184
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,350
They were just amazing.

185
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:56,269
And in the A section, premiership team, 20 of the 22 were St. Bede's alumni.

186
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,049
They were former students.

187
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:59,350
We had five under-19s.

188
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,549
Sam Anstey, who wasn't part of the alumni, was teaching at the school at the time.

189
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,350
And the other guy who didn't go to St. Bede's...

190
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,370
He's Jamie Maddox, who's now our development manager at the Western Bulldogs, which is an interesting irony.

191
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:23,210
So that was amazing when you think of the amateur nature of the game, you know, with the Vafa.

192
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:35,629
And, yeah, talking about sliding doors moments, you know, in that C section grand final, at one point, it was 21 goals, 12 to 21 goals, 11.

193
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,750
And, you know, can you fathom that?

194
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,570
Yeah.

195
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,070
And I think it was just amazing to see that score line, for there to be a point at the end, the difference was just amazing.

196
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,590
So I am very grateful.

197
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:50,090
I do feel fortunate and lucky in some ways.

198
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,190
I mean, if that game is two points the other way, the Ajax boys have got it over us.

199
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:07,070
But it was an amazing time, Darson, I think, when I'm really fortunate to be in this collaboration or the collaborative forum with...

200
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,250
with some really influential coaches.

201
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:21,429
And when you listen to Ange Postacoglu and Brian Gorgian and Eddie Jones and Neil Craig talk,

202
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:30,269
one of the things that comes through is they really believe in what they're trying to achieve, who they are, what they do, what they stand for.

203
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,149
They're prepared to take risks.

204
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,769
They coach on the edge.

205
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,889
And when I think back to those early days of coaching,

206
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:38,649
that's what I did.

207
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:48,970
And so in times of when you're challenged and there's some struggle in convincing people at different ends of the spectrum,

208
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,629
the belief in yourself and to stay true to what you believe in, it's just absolutely imperative.

209
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,690
And those guys I just mentioned, they just epitomize that.

210
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:05,769
And it's been great to listen to them because it's a reminder to me that, yeah, stay, you know, continue to believe in what you do.

211
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,769
Because it's, you know...

212
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:14,210
It's fostered some success, notwithstanding amazing contributions from a lot of others.

213
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,750
You'll love to talk to you about that in a moment as well,

214
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,710
the collaboration that is a passion of mine through the work we're doing with my great friend Matt Waterwitz and Alita and the Alita Connect program.

215
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,529
But I just want to go back to some beats for a moment because I rang a couple of your old teammates in preparation for this.

216
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,809
And I just want to get a sense.

217
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:31,509
I've read about it.

218
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,190
I've heard about it.

219
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,610
I've spoken to you about it.

220
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:37,409
To find out from their point of view and the words that sort of came up were,

221
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,870
this was the best three years of my life.

222
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,629
The way that Luke Beveridge made me feel through that time, I've never felt better about myself as a person.

223
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,309
You know, I might have been a 6 out of 10 player at best.

224
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,250
He made me feel and play like a 9 out of 10 player at the time.

225
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,450
And, you know, in an amateur setting, you've got people going to work.

226
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,809
Like, it's something amazing, mate.

227
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,509
It's really an incredible story.

228
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,210
It's, you know...

229
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,169
I love that the emotion runs freely with you, mate.

230
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,889
And I could hear emotion in their voices when they were telling the story, just how special that era was.

231
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:15,970
You know, how does that make you feel?

232
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,269
Yeah, emotional, mate.

233
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,129
It was.

234
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:27,590
It was an amazing part of all of our lives because I suppose the game, you know, we grew up loving.

235
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,929
For it to culminate in something like that was just, you know, incredible.

236
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,470
And, you know, the connections.

237
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:45,470
And as far as the friendships and the relationships, the things that endure and are long-lasting and they still remain.

238
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,309
We had a great social environment too.

239
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:51,809
We'd celebrate victories as well as anyone.

240
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,389
And I'm a great believer in that, you know, how do you measure success?

241
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:02,370
How do you identify and celebrate little successes or milestones along the way?

242
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,529
I mean, whatever it is, you have to make sure that you do.

243
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:06,950
You recognise your achievements.

244
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,190
It's not all about winning the trophy at the end of the year.

245
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,149
It's about what happens during the week and that week in competition.

246
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:23,149
And we definitely didn't miss out on an opportunity to bond and connect through small achievements,

247
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,330
which to us were just great, great moments in time.

248
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:34,509
And I think, you know, even this weekend, it's the anniversary of Paul Brennan's passing.

249
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,330
Paul was our ruckman in the game.

250
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,629
In the C and the B years.

251
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:46,769
And Paul was one of four boys who came to us from Udith Vale Aspendale, including Chris Jamerson and Sam Anstey,

252
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,429
who I mentioned before, and Anthony Scafidi, who was Andrew Scafidi's older brother.

253
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,529
And Andrew was already playing with us.

254
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,090
And those four young men in particular, it was only four players.

255
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,710
They had such an impact on the football club just through their personalities.

256
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,150
They weren't all senior players.

257
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,289
And Paul was overweight.

258
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,990
He was at the time and he wasn't fit.

259
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,829
And he just knuckled down.

260
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,230
He worked his, you know, he just worked so hard to be a part of the team.

261
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:15,809
And he was.

262
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,369
He was only six foot two and a half as a ruckman.

263
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:25,269
And Brezza was a police officer who, yeah, who took his own life.

264
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,190
But so this, the boys meet at the pier in Mordialloc.

265
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,150
And as a ritual, they jump off in memory of Paul.

266
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,210
And I've only really just been caught up in it last year.

267
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,490
And now, and I got a text yesterday to say, hey, we're doing it again.

268
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:47,289
And that's a sort of, you know, triumph from tragedy, sort of the whole thing.

269
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,269
But yeah, it was when, if any of the boys, obviously one of the boys said it was probably

270
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:58,049
some of the best years of my life, it definitely was for me.

271
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,769
And I think that's the, I'm lucky again and fortunate that after that experience,

272
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:06,450
it didn't matter who I coached.

273
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,250
Because I was.

274
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,349
I was satisfied.

275
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:15,930
You know, I was full to the brim with the game and I could have walked away and not

276
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,630
been a part of it, but I love it too much.

277
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:24,990
And so now in times where it's not going so well, the memories of, of what we all went

278
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,009
through and now with what we've been through with the Bulldogs, there's so many great memories

279
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:36,829
and positive things to reflect on that they override, you know, the challenges and, and

280
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:37,230
the negatives.

281
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,069
And it's pretty easy to reflect on them and, and turn your state of mind in the right direction.

282
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,269
I think the incredible thing, Bebo, for me is that you've been able to take that same

283
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:52,509
essence now into the professional environment and create those same relationships and that,

284
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,589
and that same feel.

285
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,970
And a lot of what you did when you first took on the senior coaching role in 2015, and I'll

286
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,009
talk about, you know, your impact at Collingwood and Hawthorne as well as some beads at some

287
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,630
stage over this chat.

288
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,230
But, but really, you know, we weren't allowed.

289
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,710
We weren't allowed to celebrate prior to you bringing that in to AFL football.

290
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:15,390
It was frowned upon if you were seen to sing a song too loud or a particular, if you're

291
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,430
a club like the one you coach and I played for that we love, that's why they're no good.

292
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:20,970
Look at them.

293
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,910
They can't, they've never won anything and they celebrate.

294
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,410
You changed so many of those things that were, were set in stone.

295
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,890
Was that a conscious thing or is that just you being you?

296
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,849
I think a combination of both.

297
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,190
Um, I don't think it's too difficult.

298
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,990
I think it's too difficult to work out that unified outfits, you know, whether it's teams

299
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:47,309
or groups of people are more a chance to achieve something significant, um, if they're bonded

300
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:53,630
and, and, and if they want to do things for each other and what greater opportunity is

301
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,710
there than after winning or achieving something together that you actually really celebrate

302
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,950
the contributions of, um, of your peers, of your teammates, um, of your fellow workmates

303
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,990
right on, right then and there, you know?

304
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:07,230
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

305
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,730
and make sure that, that you recognize and thank each other for, for what you're doing.

306
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,250
And, and if you walk away thinking, oh, well, we've got to focus on the next one, you've

307
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,210
just missed out on one of the golden opportunities to, to make your establishment, make your

308
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,690
organization even stronger.

309
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,769
So I've always felt that it was critical to do that.

310
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:37,009
Um, you know, there's some, I think there's some literature, well, I know there's some

311
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:42,329
how we can get it wrong when we don't acknowledge, you know, little successes, you know, whether

312
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:48,609
it's our children or, or whether it's our, our players and we're all in need of a pat

313
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:54,930
on the back and we, we're all looking for affirmation, positive affirmation and, and

314
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:02,230
we have to continue to search for opportunities to, to recognize and, um, and make sure people

315
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,990
feel good about themselves because they're, they're doing their best and, um, you know,

316
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:15,369
I think alcohol, alcohol is obviously a drug that, um, is a bane in our society in moderation.

317
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:23,170
I think it can really facilitate in the right, in the right, um, you know, amounts can, can

318
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,369
start the conversation as long as you, as long as you jump off, you know, step off pretty

319
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:27,750
early.

320
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,869
Um, and, and there's no doubt that sometimes even back then at St. B's, we probably took

321
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,869
it too far and got it wrong at times because intoxication.

322
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:40,650
Isn't the right way to end up and, and that happened here and there.

323
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,789
But, um, yeah, I consciously went after it and, um, and, and I must admit probably selfishly

324
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:55,089
as well that yearning to be part of a club environment that, um, was, was special at

325
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:55,650
the time.

326
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,210
You just didn't want to leave.

327
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,490
And, uh, and I think we all got caught up in that and, you know, the game at this level

328
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,849
now, the professional national level, you can't do that.

329
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:06,990
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

330
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:13,750
and unfortunately, um, you know, you, you're fragmented, um, and, and you, you go away

331
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,130
and you sort of, you subgroups and now, cause there's a lot of night games, there's not

332
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,349
an opportunity to do it too often, but when there is again, you know, we really pursue

333
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:26,549
that where we can at the Bulldogs cause it can be really powerful.

334
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,410
Sounds such a simple thing, isn't it?

335
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,430
To celebrate those small moments, but it is a great legacy of your leadership.

336
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,569
It wasn't, uh, allowed, you know, in the space of Australian rules football and I think you

337
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,730
really brought that to the forefront along with many other things.

338
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,509
Changing tack again, so many things I want to come back to Bevo that you've said, but

339
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,089
I needed to ask you, I wanted to ask you about your, your, your grandfather, the legendary

340
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:52,089
Jack Beveridge, who was part of the, the machine, the four premierships in a row in the 1930s

341
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:52,710
at Collingwood.

342
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:58,109
And I was reading your story again in the last 24 hours at 27 years of age, he moved

343
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:58,569
to the West.

344
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,509
It was depression era.

345
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:04,230
So to support the family and financially they go to Western Australia is an incredible impact

346
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,410
on the West Perth footy club and changes so much.

347
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,130
So much about them.

348
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,650
He then goes to Launceston as captain coach, wins a premiership, uh, Horsham the year

349
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:17,250
after and, and, and wins a premiership, incredible, you know, legacy of success.

350
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,009
And, and, you know, they talk about him as a voracious reader and learner and someone

351
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,829
who was really interested in how he can impact the world.

352
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:27,789
It feels like a lot of that DNA is in you.

353
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,230
Can you tell us a bit about your relationship with him?

354
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,170
Yeah, he actually finished at Colerain, I think in the end too, you know, and they,

355
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,970
yeah, he, he got knocked out at the start of a grand final, which was interesting.

356
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,890
Um, um, they actually won that grand final, but he, he was a publican too.

357
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:51,170
He ran the Colerain pub for a fair while and, um, and Jack and Mercia, his wife, uh,

358
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,210
they, uh, they had great relationships with, with the locals and, um, and I managed to

359
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,630
take dad back there a couple of years ago and just have one last beer.

360
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,369
Um, dad's, you know, probably nearer to the end than the start, as we know.

361
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,710
And I think it was good for him to, to get back there and experience that.

362
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:15,490
But, um, my, my main connection with him was usually on a day when I couldn't go to

363
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,950
school, uh, if I need to be looked after, I'd go around and spend some time with, with

364
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,269
Jack and Mercia and he was, he was immobile by then, you know, and he was fit and strong

365
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:27,410
during his playing days.

366
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:33,849
But I think, you know, managing a hotel and, um, and dealing with, uh, with different things,

367
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,970
he, both of them became heavy smokers.

368
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,289
Um, and I think I used to probably smoke 15 or 16 cigarettes passively every day when

369
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,450
I was sitting in their lounge room.

370
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,309
Um, but, um, you know, he, he didn't say a lot.

371
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,930
He, he seemed really wise and, you know, he had that really, it was almost like he had

372
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,589
that old Collingwood head, you know, that really wise, you know, sort of Wiedemann type

373
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:02,789
head, yet it was my grandfather, Jack Beveridge.

374
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,789
So it's been some special times.

375
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:05,730
I, I remember.

376
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,589
We used to go around there on Christmas day and, and, and play cricket.

377
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:17,630
They lived in, um, a court in, uh, in Hyatt and I was batting one day in part in play.

378
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,329
He was, um, in his mid seventies, but he came out, he walked out and he, he was standing

379
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:28,109
in between cover and mid off and, and I, I thought I got one off the middle and he just

380
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,589
stuck his left hand out and caught it.

381
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,410
And, uh, I think I would have only been about seven or eight years old and I spat the dummy

382
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,309
and I couldn't believe the reflex.

383
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,289
I says, oh, I just didn't think he had it in him and he just stuck the mid out and caught

384
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:41,450
it.

385
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,349
And so there's some special memories there.

386
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,009
Um, actually when he, when, when he, when they, they both passed within about four days

387
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:56,589
of each other, uh, and when, uh, mom and dad and the estate was wound up and the house

388
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:03,029
in Hyatt was to be sold, they actually lived next door to a biker gang and, um, and I didn't

389
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,769
really understand.

390
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,769
I was pretty young and, uh.

391
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:13,390
And, and the auction was about to start and the auctioneer, um, had, had done his, um,

392
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,130
his early blurb and he was about to get into, uh, the selling of the house or the auctioneering

393
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,990
of the house and about six or seven bikers walked out the front of, uh, of the house

394
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,269
next door and you reckon the house got sold?

395
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,109
So it was passed in at a, you know, a moderate price and I think it was sold to the state

396
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:33,509
government as a commission house.

397
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,390
And, uh, so, uh, the inheritance.

398
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,170
Um, probably dropped off by about 20 or 30 grand, I think, thanks to the next door, next

399
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:41,670
door neighbors.

400
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,170
Um, can you see the synergy though, Bevo, in, in that story and your eye and my, I spoke,

401
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:52,150
you know, to you a moment ago about some beads and the incredible story of that, but you

402
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,369
know, you, you went back into the AFL system at Collingwood, they win a flag in 2010 and

403
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,809
you'll be too humble to talk about your influence, but the Collingwood insiders tell me it was

404
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:01,190
profound.

405
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:05,309
Your time at Hawthorne, I think there was two premierships in that period of time, you

406
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,230
had a massive impact.

407
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,309
On the whole group and their defense in particular, and, and then we'll get to the Bulldogs in

408
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:16,630
two years and what, and what you've achieved, but it feels as though that's a very, uh,

409
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,410
similar path to your grandfather's.

410
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,269
Is there, is there a sense of history about that or?

411
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,710
Yeah, maybe a little.

412
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:28,029
I mean, I, I sometimes, you know, you, you think back in wonder or what, what par achieves

413
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,230
seemed like everywhere he went, they won a premiership, you know, everywhere he coached,

414
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,009
um, and sometimes played.

415
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:36,210
He, uh, you've just mentioned.

416
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,390
A few of them does, whether it be Launceston or Horsham or West Perth, it's just everywhere

417
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,710
he went and, and obviously the Collingwood machine and the four flags.

418
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:49,230
And, uh, um, as I mentioned earlier, you know, he, he would sit here and he'd be the first

419
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:55,130
to say what I said about how gratefully he was back then for, you know, his teammates

420
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,049
and, and how hard everyone worked to achieve something.

421
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,690
Um, but yeah, as far as synergies go and, you know, probably feeling fortunate and lucky

422
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,210
in the game, you know, there's many of, many of us who have, you know, have, you know,

423
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,190
been really involved in the game for long periods of time who just don't taste, you

424
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,309
know, any sort of tangible success.

425
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:19,069
And I played in some junior flags at St. Peter's, you know, we, we, from under 11s to 15s, we

426
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,309
just used to win every year.

427
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,230
Um, and I played in, um, you know, reserves one with you, Darcy, at the Dogs and played

428
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,490
in some losing ones as well.

429
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,369
But, um, you know, until St. Pete's, you know, I, as far as senior footy goes, it was an

430
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:34,950
open book.

431
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:41,650
And, um, for it to go the way it has and to be involved in so much club and team success.

432
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:47,829
So I just, I feel really privileged and, and I suppose, yeah, there, there is some, um,

433
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,349
some synergy there in that we're, we're probably both really fortunate that the game has allowed

434
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:54,250
us to experience those times.

435
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:54,829
Yeah.

436
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:55,789
Both incredibly humble.

437
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,250
I suspect if, uh, Jack Beveridge is sitting here, I think we'd be hearing a similar type

438
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,710
of, uh, of language.

439
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,250
Um, I wanted to touch on you for me.

440
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:04,930
You're such a, you're such a, you're such a, you're such a, you're such a, you're such

441
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,529
a unique leader and we're talking leadership and you've had a diverse range of things in

442
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,109
your life from, you know, working at Austrac, which is a government agency that tracks,

443
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:19,009
um, laundered money effectively, you know, from, from crime and, um, you know, studied

444
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,569
various things at different stages.

445
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,190
I'm not sure if this is true, but I think when you did your business career, you took

446
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,609
a fashion subject just as a bit of an offshoot.

447
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,529
I like to remind people of that.

448
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,309
The youngsters.

449
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,750
Might be the only thing you failed at, potentially, if I can be so bold.

450
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,529
Well, qualifies you to be a critic though.

451
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,710
Why the, how did you end up at Austrac?

452
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,730
I mean, for someone listening to you and your sporting background, a government agency,

453
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,529
I, you know, you, why did you end up there?

454
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:53,230
Yeah, I worked at the tax office for seven years and they, um, really grateful, uh, they

455
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,549
sponsored me and put me through university and I, I graduated, um, through the union

456
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,450
of New South Wales.

457
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,730
I studied by distance and that was probably the busiest time in my life.

458
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,569
At the end of, um, completing that degree, cause I was, I was on a couple of subjects.

459
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,049
I was coaching some beads.

460
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:18,130
I had a young family, um, Kai and Noah were born, Dana and I, um, so we were looking after

461
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,490
a family.

462
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:24,309
I was working full time and, um, so I was studying late at night and I, there weren't

463
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:25,470
enough hours in the day.

464
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:30,309
So you had to sort of give up on a bit of sleep and, um, and when I graduated and I,

465
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:33,309
I'd moved up the, the rungs or the levels within.

466
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:41,690
I was in the ATO and I'd got to the executive level and, um, and at the time the, um, the

467
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,529
financial transactions act, uh, had been repealed and, and the anti-money laundering counter

468
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:56,349
terrorism finance act had just, um, reached Royal assent and Austrac were the administrator,

469
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:01,170
um, the, you know, the government agency that oversaw that out of the attorney general's

470
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:01,349
office.

471
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,730
So they advertised for some positions.

472
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:09,730
And cause I was in compliance or investigations, it, it matched, it suited my skillset, but

473
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,450
it was just a different body of legislation.

474
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:17,329
And, uh, and, but there were great opportunities to teach, um, small, medium, large business

475
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:19,849
on how to comply with the new legislation.

476
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,950
And, um, and, and, and I needed to change.

477
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:27,809
I've always either, if I haven't got a new job or a new role, you know, within the sort

478
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:33,730
of three or four year mark, um, I've moved agencies and, and it, it had got to the point

479
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,210
where the tax office, I was probably seeing it out to finish my degree and time seemed

480
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,210
right.

481
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,490
And, um, the geography is right though, cornered Burke and William and, um, and I enjoyed working

482
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,730
in the city and, uh, and I was looking forward to, um, the challenge of, uh, and, and learning

483
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,490
too, you know, learning more about, um, other areas in commerce, but probably more the finance

484
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,490
sector.

485
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,630
Uh, and, uh, and so I moved on.

486
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:08,500
Although it's, uh, it's, it's fascinating.

487
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,859
I was reading a book I really enjoyed over the summer called Range and I, and I've got

488
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,339
the author's name off the top of my head, but I'll, I'll put it in the show notes afterwards

489
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,900
so people can look it up if they're interested.

490
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:25,019
And the book's sort of thesis is that people who achieve great, um, legendary status in

491
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,980
life and, and, uh, and find their true meaning and, and great to sample a range of different

492
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
things.

493
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,980
To me on the outside, you're the most unlikely tax office compliance officer in history,

494
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
but when you hear you describe it, there's great.

495
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,599
There's creativity in that.

496
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,700
And someone who's incredibly creative as you are, you know, to be able to delve into that

497
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,319
world and then have the other pursuits that you've had in the sporting life and your family

498
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,839
life and other areas that have, uh, did you see that package has sort of come together

499
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,059
now, you know, to, to form the person that you are and doing a role feels to me like

500
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,140
you're born to be a coach.

501
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,059
You're born to do this, but you've sampled a lot of things along the way to, to get there.

502
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,059
Is that, does that make sense?

503
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,059
Yeah.

504
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,859
And I, you know, the, the fascinating thing for me is, and I mentioned earlier, I don't

505
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,940
feel like I'm maturity.

506
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
Really enough.

507
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
You know, I was a terrible secondary school student.

508
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,599
I, I had football on my mind.

509
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,119
I wanted to be an AFL player, VFL at the time.

510
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,500
And, um, I, I lent on a great mate of mine, Anthony Lance, who was studying, um, the right

511
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,940
subjects to be a physiotherapist and him and I were both studying mass science.

512
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,819
So he, he really helped me at the end of year 11, his notes were on point.

513
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:35,940
Um, and I figured I'd do the same in year 12 and, and it didn't all come together.

514
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
I, I, I definitely couldn't.

515
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
Yeah.

516
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
I graduated okay.

517
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:46,319
And I started off, um, pursuing an environmental studies degree at Rusden, but I, I just wasn't

518
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,319
a good student.

519
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:51,019
I pulled the pin and it coincided with me playing senior footy at Melbourne, um, as

520
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,019
an 18 year old.

521
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:56,500
So I'd kind of had enough and I went, went, went over and, um, started mowing some lawns

522
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,700
and became a gardener for a little while.

523
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:05,599
But I, I, what happened when, um, I finished my AFL career at 29, I needed to get busy

524
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,940
with a career.

525
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:15,960
And the, the tax office had just advertised for many, many positions, um, the implementation

526
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,079
of GST was about to occur and there's a mobile education workforce that was about to hit

527
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,079
the road.

528
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,579
And I wanted to be part of that purely because of the opportunities and the pathway forward

529
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:28,579
for me.

530
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:35,380
Uh, I managed to, um, land one of those positions, um, and ultimately when I realised there was

531
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,820
an opportunity to study at tertiary level.

532
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,960
Through the tax office, I, I pounced on that as well.

533
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,880
And I ultimately, I was probably the perfect remote student.

534
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,860
I was that paranoid about failing anything that, that, you know, possibly the, the degree

535
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,260
would be over because I couldn't see myself coming back to it.

536
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
It was all or nothing.

537
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Yeah.

538
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
And I studied extremely hard.

539
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,619
I, I was probably the model tertiary student, you know, as, um, I was self-driven, I was

540
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:04,960
willing to sit down at night, open the books.

541
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
I was really interested in the law.

542
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,460
And it was a law based, uh, a law faculty degree, but I, I, I really, you know, I enjoyed

543
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,960
the fact that I was achieving something different and I was now good at something that I wasn't

544
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,980
good at as a, as an 18 year old.

545
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,679
And I think, and that's where my appetite and capacity, capacity to read started to

546
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,679
kick in.

547
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:34,099
Cause beyond the law books, I started to have an appetite for different types of literature,

548
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,940
um, broaden my knowledge.

549
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,119
I started to have an appetite for different types of books, you know, and that helped

550
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,480
me, you know, as I was, as I was, uh, teaching the, the conversation of the law, the book

551
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,559
I was making out of, the, the, the, the book I was making out of, um, um, the first book

552
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,480
that I'd published in edition, um, I started to keep track of the content.

553
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,519
I'd put out the books that I'd made out of, um, the book I was making out of, and so,

554
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,139
so, um, I, I read it and I, and I, I made it more short and more meaningful, more, you

555
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,139
know, you know, more sophisticated.

556
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:03,739
And I, I learned a lot from that, um, this, this, this, this, you know, the, this, this,

557
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:04,739
you know, and it, I, it was just, it was an amazing experience.

558
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:05,739
Yeah.

559
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,179
story, isn't it? For me at 29 years of age, you're coaching some beads, you're studying the law,

560
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:14,760
you're working the tax office, and you mentioned Noah and Kai and Dana, your beautiful life. We're

561
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,260
all in love with Dana, I think, when you were younger and your childhood sweetheart. How do

562
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,920
you manage? I love talking to leaders about managing all that. How do you get that right

563
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,119
without one of those wheels falling off? And even just family life in general, how have you managed

564
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,780
that through your work and family balance? Yeah, I was fortunate that the boys were really

565
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:43,460
young at the time and they were low maintenance in a way. And so my number one priority was

566
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,500
I didn't miss out and they didn't miss out on the father-son stuff. And that's why the books

567
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:56,679
wouldn't come out until they were in bed. And so nothing was really compromised. I was able to fit

568
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:04,760
everything in and probably my sleep patterns went from eight or so hours a night to maybe

569
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,519
six, sometimes five and a catch up later on in the week. And I think I haven't really ever gone

570
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:16,500
back to the eight hour pattern, even though you probably need to have a bit of a sleep in here

571
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,400
and there or get to bed early. But yeah, I think just prioritizing, getting the balance right.

572
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,840
The kids were never less important than anything. They were always at the top of the list and Dana

573
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,679
as well, making sure that she was okay. Dana's a nurse and she took,

574
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:43,940
some time off work and she's an unbelievable mother and life partner for me and making sure

575
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,980
our relationship was always strong. So I think the balance was right and the footy was,

576
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:57,159
probably thankfully Dana really enjoys the game and the boys, you want to expose them to it

577
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,800
because it's important that they play team sports and the boys have always loved the game as well.

578
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,159
So,

579
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,119
um,

580
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,739
in the,

581
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,079
early parts of my coaching,

582
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,420
it was easy to expose them when they were really young to,

583
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,860
and take them down to the club and,

584
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,360
and Dana would,

585
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,860
uh,

586
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,159
you know,

587
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,460
involve herself here and there.

588
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,920
So I think on balance,

589
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:16,719
I got it right.

590
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,500
It's just that the work commitments at times,

591
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,300
um,

592
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,199
you know,

593
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:21,360
they,

594
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,539
they,

595
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,739
they were pretty measured.

596
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,860
I suppose always on a level where you could,

597
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,679
uh,

598
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:28,639
and predictable that it was,

599
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:31,820
wasn't going to encroach into some of the other priorities.

600
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,739
Um,

601
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,599
changing gears slightly from that,

602
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:34,940
uh,

603
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,460
Bevo,

604
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,219
I caught up with Marcus Bond and Pele,

605
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,039
who's the captain of your team at the moment,

606
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,920
the Bulldogs and,

607
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,420
and,

608
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,960
um,

609
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,659
you're going to be an iconic player if he's not already at 25 years of age,

610
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,840
I think Marcus is still.

611
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,099
And,

612
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:49,139
and I asked him about you and,

613
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:49,500
and,

614
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:49,880
uh,

615
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,380
and I'm paraphrasing here and he said,

616
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,480
he said,

617
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:01,000
Bevo to me is the person that has asked himself the big questions in life and he's comfortable with the answers and comfortable in his own skin.

618
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,260
Does that sort of resonate with you,

619
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,460
Bevo?

620
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:03,920
Does that make,

621
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,500
make sense?

622
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,059
That that description?

623
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,960
Uh,

624
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,139
well,

625
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,820
I think it's a great compliment if,

626
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,260
if he thinks that way,

627
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,679
he,

628
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,179
um,

629
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:12,739
and that's where,

630
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:13,199
you know,

631
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,260
talking about gratitude and how fortunate we are to,

632
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,780
to work and,

633
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,119
um,

634
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,019
relate and be friends with,

635
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,860
with different people now in our lives.

636
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,820
He's just a high end,

637
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:26,699
um,

638
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,760
individual in person,

639
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:28,980
you know,

640
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,820
his integrity,

641
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,619
his character.

642
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,280
And,

643
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,559
and I,

644
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,059
I think that's part of the,

645
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,960
um,

646
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,099
the challenge with,

647
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:42,980
with many of us who are searching for who we want to be and how we should manage our own personal space.

648
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:48,900
It's recognizing when sometimes people are just a better human beings than others.

649
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:49,559
And,

650
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,059
uh,

651
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:50,780
and he's,

652
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,659
he's just a,

653
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,139
an incredible human being and,

654
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:54,639
um,

655
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,099
allowing him to be autonomous in what he does,

656
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,059
but also learning,

657
00:39:59,059 --> 00:39:59,340
you know,

658
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,679
he's,

659
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,980
he's going great benefit from also the collaboration that you put together for,

660
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,500
for him,

661
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:04,760
you know,

662
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,199
with him being able to relate to guys like Pat Cummins and Rob Sitch and,

663
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,139
and some of the other people in there.

664
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:11,639
Andy Lee.

665
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,320
Andy Lee.

666
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,599
Yeah.

667
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:12,900
You know,

668
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,599
in that forum,

669
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:14,960
it's allowed me,

670
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,860
because part of the early part of his football life,

671
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,219
I missed his first year,

672
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,039
Marcus,

673
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,159
but it enabled me to,

674
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,039
and it challenged me to,

675
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,760
um,

676
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,320
to guide him a little bit and,

677
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,199
and help him with his thinking in different ways as,

678
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,079
as it did with,

679
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,440
with Bob and Easton and,

680
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,179
but they were in a different,

681
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:34,860
um,

682
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,239
stages of their lives and,

683
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,780
and,

684
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,059
uh,

685
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,840
and their footy careers.

686
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,019
But it got to a point with Marcus where,

687
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,119
um,

688
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,679
you know,

689
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:43,179
he was,

690
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:44,639
he was really exploring,

691
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,360
you know,

692
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,099
his own influence outside of what anyone else was thinking.

693
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,420
And,

694
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
and I think the,

695
00:40:52,300 --> 00:41:01,639
him being able to speak and listen in that forum and different things he's exposed to at the moment have really shaped him even more.

696
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:01,880
And,

697
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,239
and he's got a,

698
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,500
an inner confidence that,

699
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,320
um,

700
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:07,559
that his about life balance is right,

701
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:07,860
but,

702
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,340
but he is influential and he's comfortable with himself.

703
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,039
I think if he says that I've asked myself the questions and,

704
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,619
and I'm comfortable with the answers at the,

705
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,619
at the tender age,

706
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,179
I think he's 25 now at,

707
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,800
you know,

708
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,500
I reckon he's almost done the same.

709
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:25,099
And this is what I'm saying about,

710
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,460
I wish I was more like that when I was his age and I was nowhere near it.

711
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,079
Um,

712
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:31,760
so it's respecting that,

713
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,280
acknowledging,

714
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,159
acknowledging that and allowing him to be powerful because he is not allowing him.

715
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,260
I don't need to allow him.

716
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:38,559
Now,

717
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,840
if I tried to stop him,

718
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,360
he'd quickly barge through it,

719
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,159
um,

720
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:42,900
because he,

721
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,420
he should,

722
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:43,940
and he would,

723
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,519
and he could,

724
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:45,500
uh,

725
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,059
because he's just so highly respected.

726
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:48,500
So,

727
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,300
um,

728
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm really comfortable now that,

729
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,059
you know,

730
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,059
he and I work more in a partnership,

731
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,179
um,

732
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:55,480
than,

733
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:56,460
than say,

734
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:56,780
uh,

735
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:57,440
um,

736
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:58,340
you know,

737
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,119
him being the two I see he's,

738
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,079
he's,

739
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,179
he should be more,

740
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,500
influential than me as far as how the playing group pursues the behaviors of both him and

741
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:09,739
I.

742
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:11,300
And he definitely,

743
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,300
he is.

744
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,500
And,

745
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,840
and sometimes he's unsure about how far to push that.

746
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,079
And,

747
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:16,860
and that's the,

748
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,239
the humility in Marcus Spontanpelli.

749
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,460
And,

750
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,900
and I think he gets the balance right.

751
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,579
Yeah.

752
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:22,860
It's remarkable to hear you say that,

753
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,519
uh,

754
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:23,840
you know,

755
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,059
Bevo,

756
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,940
that you're allowing,

757
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:26,360
you know,

758
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,880
the hierarchy of coaching that we,

759
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,460
um,

760
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,039
experience would never have even thought of talking about being in partnership.

761
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:32,440
And,

762
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:32,880
you know,

763
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,219
as you said,

764
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,480
you get a once in a generation type of person.

765
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,300
He's a special,

766
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,199
special human being,

767
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,840
that young man.

768
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,119
And to,

769
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,300
to have that and,

770
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,820
and clearly that relationship with you is,

771
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,079
uh,

772
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,960
is unique.

773
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,239
And I,

774
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,559
again,

775
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:43,739
mate,

776
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:44,059
I love it.

777
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,739
I can hear the emotion in your voice.

778
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,960
My wife always says to me,

779
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,119
I don't think boarding school was your friend,

780
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,159
didn't allow you to,

781
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:50,440
uh,

782
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,380
to experience emotion because it wasn't your friend then.

783
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,880
But I,

784
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,000
I love how comfortable and free you are with,

785
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:56,639
with your most.

786
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,559
Thanks for mentioning the,

787
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,260
the Alita Connect space because,

788
00:42:59,420 --> 00:42:59,739
you know,

789
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:00,639
we're really passionate about,

790
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,219
um,

791
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:01,760
my old friend,

792
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,639
Matt Waterwitz and I,

793
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,440
and can I ask you to talk a little bit about it?

794
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,219
You mentioned that,

795
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,460
that it's been positive for Marcus,

796
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,800
but for you with,

797
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,440
with Eddie Jones from English rugby and,

798
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,079
and Neil Craig,

799
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,099
who coached the Crows and,

800
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,780
and a high performance background,

801
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,820
uh,

802
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,840
at the elite level in every,

803
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,079
every sport just about,

804
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:16,360
and,

805
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,059
and Ansh Poster Collier is doing incredible things at Celtic.

806
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:19,719
Amazing.

807
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,719
As the first Australian coach.

808
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,019
Yeah.

809
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,679
Um,

810
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,079
I remember talking to you about it and,

811
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:23,699
and as always,

812
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,079
you always like to think things through,

813
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,760
but it feels like it's been a real,

814
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,639
a real positive for you.

815
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,239
Oh,

816
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,739
it's been such an,

817
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:30,780
an ear opener,

818
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,400
an eye opener,

819
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:31,739
you know,

820
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,420
to listen to their experiences and,

821
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,760
and,

822
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:35,719
you know,

823
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:35,960
there's,

824
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,719
there's various throwaway,

825
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,500
um,

826
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,019
key messages to take away from most of our discussions,

827
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:42,440
you know,

828
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,219
but the,

829
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,519
probably the overriding thing that comes out of everything is if you're in your comfort zone,

830
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:48,380
you're in the wrong zone,

831
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:48,679
you know,

832
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,460
you're always on the edge and,

833
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,579
um,

834
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,360
and there's a lot of differences in,

835
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,000
in what we do based on whether it's the international stage or,

836
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,099
um,

837
00:43:59,659 --> 00:43:59,840
and,

838
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,920
and ownership of,

839
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,739
of different organisations,

840
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,320
and,

841
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,639
you know,

842
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:05,840
Ange is obviously coaching Celtic and the ownership,

843
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,619
all right,

844
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,840
is very different to a,

845
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,159
an AFL club,

846
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,219
um,

847
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,900
that's really owned by the members and it's a non-profit organisation and when you think about Brian Gorgian and,

848
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,039
and the owners of the different basketball teams that he's coached and,

849
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:22,119
um,

850
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:23,760
and what's,

851
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,659
what is really clear is how challenging the coaching and the educational piece has been in China for,

852
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:33,840
for Brian when he,

853
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,179
you know,

854
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:40,699
he coached for about 10 years in China when you think you're standing in front of your whole roster and they can't understand what you're saying,

855
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:41,300
you know,

856
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,300
and you've got interpreters there,

857
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,559
what,

858
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,760
what an amazing,

859
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,760
enormous challenge that would be and,

860
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,719
and he's talked about that and,

861
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,199
and Ange similarly when he's coaching Yokohama in Japan,

862
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,019
the,

863
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:52,300
the,

864
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,079
the language barrier is significant.

865
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:54,659
Uh,

866
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:54,780
he,

867
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,460
he must be so relieved that as much as the Scots have got pretty hefty accents,

868
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,659
they still understand,

869
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,380
you know,

870
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,739
his,

871
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,940
his English and his Australian,

872
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:04,599
um,

873
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:05,599
angle.

874
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,239
Uh,

875
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,179
so it's probably a bit of a relief that he doesn't need the interpreters,

876
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,380
although he's brought some Japanese boys over,

877
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:12,260
uh,

878
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,440
he's doing an amazing job.

879
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:13,579
And,

880
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,300
and when you think about the pressures of coaching national teams,

881
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,079
Brian's just,

882
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,559
you know,

883
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,380
experienced coaching,

884
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:20,579
um,

885
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,860
the Australian basketball team to the bronze medal in Tokyo.

886
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,500
And now,

887
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:25,340
you know,

888
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,719
Eddie Jones coaching,

889
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,400
you know,

890
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,579
the,

891
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,619
the English rugby union team.

892
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:30,179
Oh,

893
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,619
just fascinating.

894
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,900
You know,

895
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,179
to,

896
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,139
to listen to them talk about,

897
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,719
you know,

898
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,980
who speaks to them about the expectations and,

899
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,900
um,

900
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,960
and how they stay in their,

901
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:41,679
their own,

902
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,639
um,

903
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,179
right positive headspace and who they talk to.

904
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,539
And that's where Neil Craig's such a great confidant for,

905
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:48,420
for Eddie,

906
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:49,139
because he's,

907
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:50,019
he's,

908
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,500
he's a custodian of,

909
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:52,159
um,

910
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,079
of Eddie's,

911
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:53,840
um,

912
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,300
wellbeing as much as anything.

913
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,739
And he's an advisor and he,

914
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,619
and he helps him,

915
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:58,400
um,

916
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,360
find context and perspective in different things.

917
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,099
Uh,

918
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,199
but it's just been really,

919
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,119
really rewarding and,

920
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:04,599
and they're,

921
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:05,639
they're very wise men,

922
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,559
uh,

923
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,780
very experienced men.

924
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,300
And so it's been great for me to listen to them and,

925
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:10,780
uh,

926
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,980
talk about their experiences.

927
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,159
And the idea initially,

928
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,820
Bebo was,

929
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,260
you know,

930
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,639
to have this forum with,

931
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:15,840
uh,

932
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,880
like-minded people.

933
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,599
And clearly you guys share commonality,

934
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,500
but it really potentially private.

935
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,960
And the conversations are yours and,

936
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,239
and,

937
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,639
and yours alone and initially facilitated,

938
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:26,420
uh,

939
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,000
by Matt,

940
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,159
but we're excited,

941
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,500
you know,

942
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,380
people are listening to,

943
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,980
to people like you talk about it.

944
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:31,179
And so,

945
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,699
geez,

946
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:33,739
that'd be something that would be beneficial in my life.

947
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:34,059
And we're,

948
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,019
we're curating these,

949
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,239
these groups now of,

950
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:36,519
uh,

951
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,599
diverse people in different areas.

952
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:38,940
And,

953
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:39,360
and,

954
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:39,800
you know,

955
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,119
to me,

956
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:40,820
the idea of,

957
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,519
you know,

958
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:41,699
it's,

959
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,800
it's more corporate term,

960
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,579
but having like your,

961
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,480
your own personal board there for you to reflect with and learn from and create,

962
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:47,900
we're,

963
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,059
we're excited about what that looks like.

964
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:50,440
Do you,

965
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,019
do you see merit in it beyond the elite sporting context for people to be able to form these

966
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,800
forums and collaborative groups?

967
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,599
A leader connect is what we're doing.

968
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:57,800
The,

969
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,440
it under the banner.

970
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:58,800
Do you see,

971
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,699
do you see merit in that?

972
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:00,300
Uh,

973
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:00,900
absolutely.

974
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,019
Absolutely.

975
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,760
And it's quite simply,

976
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,460
you know,

977
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:04,699
you,

978
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,280
I mean,

979
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,880
the,

980
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,059
you don't know what,

981
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,440
what you haven't exposed yourself to or what you don't know and,

982
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,300
and listening to others talk.

983
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,980
And sometimes,

984
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,340
um,

985
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,719
you know,

986
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:20,579
you hear examples or you see examples that are very similar to things that,

987
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,480
um,

988
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,579
you've experienced in your life and to hear different perspectives and,

989
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:25,699
um,

990
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,780
and understand the way that successful people have gone about it.

991
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,119
And even,

992
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,739
even to listen to the failures and the,

993
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,559
and the disappointments is,

994
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:36,360
is a great opportunity to learn,

995
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,440
um,

996
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,420
you know,

997
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,039
what to do or what not to do.

998
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:40,699
And sometimes,

999
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:41,679
you know,

1000
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,420
you can get a lot of things right and still ultimately come up short.

1001
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:45,760
And that,

1002
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,139
that's,

1003
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:47,420
that's a really important,

1004
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,000
um,

1005
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,300
leveling message to,

1006
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,139
to all of us,

1007
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:50,420
you know,

1008
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:50,619
and I,

1009
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,219
but I think there's a real power in us,

1010
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,039
um,

1011
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,679
it being together and,

1012
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,139
and,

1013
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:56,659
and,

1014
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:58,599
and the group think and,

1015
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,280
um,

1016
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,780
and sharing and even the support,

1017
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,059
support aspect of it.

1018
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:02,519
You know,

1019
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:02,920
we,

1020
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,599
we quite often communicate and there's,

1021
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,260
there's the essence of,

1022
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,659
of,

1023
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,119
of the friendship and,

1024
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:14,360
and having each other's back is there as well.

1025
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,780
And I think there's a great power in that,

1026
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,179
especially in times of need when you're not so sure of yourself.

1027
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah.

1028
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:20,320
Brilliant,

1029
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:20,539
mate.

1030
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:20,800
It's,

1031
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,179
uh,

1032
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:21,920
it can be,

1033
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,800
I'm assuming a lonely job at times,

1034
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,119
isn't it?

1035
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,980
When you're at the helm of a very public sporting,

1036
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:26,659
uh,

1037
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:27,599
organizations and,

1038
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:27,900
and,

1039
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:28,679
you know,

1040
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,719
sort of digressing for a moment,

1041
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:30,760
uh,

1042
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,280
you know,

1043
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,260
probably been an issue.

1044
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:33,659
If you look at AFL,

1045
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,280
a lot of,

1046
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,559
uh,

1047
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,420
the mental health of,

1048
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,460
of some of our senior coaches has been a huge challenge and probably in

1049
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,199
sport around the world,

1050
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,199
never more pressure applied on one leader in one role.

1051
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:44,840
Is that,

1052
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,800
is that something that,

1053
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,260
you know,

1054
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,079
you're aware of and concerned about?

1055
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,199
We seem to have overlooked just how,

1056
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,579
how stressful it's been for a lot of people in the role that you do.

1057
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:53,639
Yeah.

1058
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,260
What's evolved over the years is the reaction and the impact on people around

1059
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,559
you.

1060
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:00,780
And,

1061
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,360
and,

1062
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,000
and how that impacts you more than the criticism of your own performance.

1063
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,440
Like I,

1064
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,860
I can quite easily deal with,

1065
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,659
um,

1066
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,599
whatever the assessment will be of,

1067
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:13,159
of my performance,

1068
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:13,880
because I know,

1069
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,760
you know,

1070
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:15,800
most,

1071
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:16,639
uh,

1072
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:16,860
you know,

1073
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,380
99.9% of anyone who reports on sport will pick something apart and,

1074
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,500
and take a really,

1075
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,539
um,

1076
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:28,880
uh,

1077
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,139
you know,

1078
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,500
take a magnifying glass,

1079
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:30,760
to,

1080
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,860
to your performance and,

1081
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,920
and pick out where,

1082
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:33,380
you know,

1083
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,440
the improvements need to come from.

1084
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:35,699
But,

1085
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,719
but also,

1086
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,400
you know,

1087
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,900
that the same population will jump in and praise when the time is right as

1088
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,099
well,

1089
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:44,500
you know,

1090
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:44,679
and,

1091
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:45,639
and,

1092
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,719
and I understand that.

1093
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,519
And occasionally there's someone who's more on the negative side than the

1094
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,199
positive side.

1095
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,019
And I think that's something that stands out every now and then.

1096
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:54,960
Um,

1097
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,139
so I can always process that for me,

1098
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:00,480
but what people around you,

1099
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,880
in particular family and friends,

1100
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,119
they'll react,

1101
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,079
you know,

1102
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:05,719
in a,

1103
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,760
in a really emotional way to any negativity towards,

1104
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,480
towards you.

1105
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,840
And then you've got to go and deal with that.

1106
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:11,559
And,

1107
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:12,920
and so sometimes,

1108
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:13,900
you know,

1109
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,139
you,

1110
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:16,219
the less you say the better,

1111
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:16,920
you know,

1112
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,099
and,

1113
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:17,440
and I,

1114
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,780
and I think this is a thing with clickbait and how the headline doesn't

1115
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,719
match the,

1116
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,239
the content of the story.

1117
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,400
Um,

1118
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,260
there's a reaction to the headline and some,

1119
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,400
well,

1120
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
have you read the story?

1121
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,679
And then a lot of people don't read the story.

1122
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:30,480
and that,

1123
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,420
so,

1124
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:33,780
and it's only there because you've spoken or,

1125
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:34,260
you know,

1126
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,579
and,

1127
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:36,219
and sometimes now,

1128
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,639
you know,

1129
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:36,800
you,

1130
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,159
you're,

1131
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,460
you're reluctant because you think if I speak,

1132
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,599
there's going to be six articles.

1133
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,440
I don't know what they're going to say.

1134
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,820
I don't know what the headline is going to be.

1135
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:49,800
So I think as far as your own headspace and your own wellbeing goes,

1136
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:50,800
uh,

1137
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,059
yeah,

1138
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:51,320
the,

1139
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,960
the support around you and the,

1140
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,820
the positive,

1141
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:54,960
um,

1142
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,719
interaction that you get from not only your own staff,

1143
00:50:58,719 --> 00:50:59,659
but definitely,

1144
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:02,900
I think you look for it from people you manage up to,

1145
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,639
uh,

1146
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,000
really feeling that support and being probably less judgmental at times.

1147
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,920
If you've got that,

1148
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,219
you know,

1149
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:10,280
you're really fortunate.

1150
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,860
I've had,

1151
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:11,880
you know,

1152
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,780
mostly I've experienced that,

1153
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,719
but there's times when you don't feel supported.

1154
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:16,559
Uh,

1155
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:17,519
and they're probably the,

1156
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,019
the most challenging times.

1157
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:20,119
Cause if you feel like,

1158
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,000
uh,

1159
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,179
you're slipping away from your own organization,

1160
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:24,219
then you,

1161
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:24,960
then you know,

1162
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,719
you're in a bit of trouble at that point in time.

1163
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:27,179
And,

1164
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
and to arrest that slide,

1165
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,300
it's,

1166
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,780
it's sometimes just too much of a slippery slope.

1167
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:37,059
Now moving towards a series of questions I've been asking all the guests,

1168
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:38,639
but before I can't believe,

1169
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:38,940
uh,

1170
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,260
and I can't leave this interview without talking about 2016.

1171
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,320
Bevo,

1172
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,199
and I'm biased because it was one of the most enjoyable days of my life being

1173
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:48,860
there on the ground,

1174
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,440
uh,

1175
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,980
working on the day and,

1176
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,239
and,

1177
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,860
and what that day meant to so many people,

1178
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,579
as I said in the intro,

1179
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:54,800
62 year gap,

1180
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,219
you take over in 2015,

1181
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,480
um,

1182
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:58,940
the so-called experts,

1183
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,980
in,

1184
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:00,159
uh,

1185
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,260
the industry is saying the Bulldogs have never been further away from success at

1186
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:03,880
that time.

1187
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:04,340
Uh,

1188
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,619
the captain is disillusioned with the club and he asked to be traded and he's

1189
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:09,559
traded to GWS.

1190
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,860
There was 700 games experience walk out.

1191
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:14,320
There was all sorts of turmoil and drama going.

1192
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,940
You walked into an environment that needed a lot of care,

1193
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:18,440
you know,

1194
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:18,699
to,

1195
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:23,760
to say it was a 501 chance that you would win in two years time is probably,

1196
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,199
um,

1197
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,960
underestimating it in some ways.

1198
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,400
And then you,

1199
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,920
you achieve that in two years.

1200
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:28,900
You look back,

1201
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,099
I mean,

1202
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:32,000
I know you move forward in this industry really quickly,

1203
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,860
but what do you think when you,

1204
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,940
when you look at that achievement?

1205
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,820
I'm ultimately very proud of,

1206
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,579
of what,

1207
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,059
what everyone achieved,

1208
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:41,579
you know,

1209
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,179
during that,

1210
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:42,800
um,

1211
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,739
you know,

1212
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:45,260
that little snapshot of,

1213
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,260
of the last,

1214
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:46,579
uh,

1215
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,260
seven years.

1216
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:47,920
Um,

1217
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:49,719
the,

1218
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,719
when you think about the complexion of the,

1219
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,199
the Bulldogs team and it was a little bit piecemeal and,

1220
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:55,820
um,

1221
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,880
so system wise to be able to implement,

1222
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,380
um,

1223
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,880
to be able to champion it as a group and for the players to totally buy in and,

1224
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,239
and push it in,

1225
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,400
in such a,

1226
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,059
um,

1227
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,159
meteoric direction was,

1228
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,119
um,

1229
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:11,940
yeah,

1230
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,159
it was,

1231
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:12,619
it was,

1232
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,199
it was unbelievable.

1233
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,079
it was,

1234
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,639
it was brilliant at the time.

1235
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:17,900
And I,

1236
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,880
and I think that,

1237
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,360
you know,

1238
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:23,519
post the 16 year and the challenges that we've faced,

1239
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,260
um,

1240
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:24,920
you know,

1241
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,119
behind the scenes and you,

1242
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,099
and you mentioned,

1243
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,460
mentioned the mental health.

1244
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:28,739
Um,

1245
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,380
we talked about the mental health earlier to us.

1246
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,239
These are the hidden things that,

1247
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,639
that can affect performance.

1248
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:35,039
And,

1249
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:38,440
and I think one of the things that we can really be proud of now is we,

1250
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,840
we never really wavered from,

1251
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,639
you know,

1252
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:42,719
strong beliefs in,

1253
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,219
in the core of what we do.

1254
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,840
Um,

1255
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:46,900
and a lot of our people,

1256
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:47,679
you know,

1257
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:49,820
have just been so stoic and,

1258
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,239
um,

1259
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,500
I mean,

1260
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,940
the playing list has turned over,

1261
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,639
turned over significantly,

1262
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:54,940
um,

1263
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:56,079
through that,

1264
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:56,480
uh,

1265
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:56,860
through the,

1266
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:58,059
through recent years.

1267
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,800
But,

1268
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,059
yeah,

1269
00:53:59,139 --> 00:53:59,360
I mean,

1270
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,019
the overwhelming emotion is,

1271
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:01,340
is,

1272
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,900
is a great sense of pride.

1273
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,659
Um,

1274
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:04,519
and,

1275
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,099
and I still,

1276
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:06,559
I've mentioned it a couple of times.

1277
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:07,619
I think if you see,

1278
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,599
if you look at the,

1279
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:10,320
the looks on the Bulldogs players,

1280
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,159
um,

1281
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:14,519
faces at the end of the 16 grand final,

1282
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:15,460
it,

1283
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:16,099
it,

1284
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:19,219
they're not ones of satisfaction and jubilation.

1285
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,460
I don't think that to me,

1286
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,239
they look surprised.

1287
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:21,699
It's like,

1288
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:22,000
you know,

1289
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,300
that just actually happened.

1290
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:23,699
You know,

1291
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:24,699
and I think that was the,

1292
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,360
the look on most of,

1293
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,260
um,

1294
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,219
the,

1295
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:28,639
you know,

1296
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,139
anyone,

1297
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,079
whether you're a supporter of the club or whether you're directly involved,

1298
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:33,539
you know,

1299
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:34,400
in a work capacity,

1300
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,960
there was a significant element of surprise.

1301
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:37,219
Yeah,

1302
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:39,099
the emotion in the MCG that day,

1303
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:41,780
even the neutral supporters could just sense that there was just something

1304
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,199
historic and special.

1305
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,340
It was an energy in that stadium that I've never felt before.

1306
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,340
Clearly biased because it's something I wanted to see my whole,

1307
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,980
uh,

1308
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,739
sporting life.

1309
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,079
But,

1310
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:51,579
uh,

1311
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:52,900
it was just a unique,

1312
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:54,800
extraordinary achievement and,

1313
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:54,960
uh,

1314
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,880
more to come on that front.

1315
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,340
But,

1316
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,500
well,

1317
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:58,179
dimensions of leadership is something we're,

1318
00:54:58,219 --> 00:55:01,219
we're passionate about seeing if there are some common traits with leaders,

1319
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,000
uh,

1320
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,800
diverse from,

1321
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,139
from different areas of,

1322
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,920
of sport and industry in the arts.

1323
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,360
But one of the things we're identifying is the idea of self-leadership.

1324
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:09,519
If,

1325
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,340
if I ask you about self-leadership,

1326
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,980
what do you think of when I,

1327
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,119
when I pose that to you?

1328
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:15,860
Uh,

1329
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,820
is this,

1330
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,679
this will sound like it,

1331
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,860
it's not off the cuff,

1332
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,239
but I,

1333
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,019
I often,

1334
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:22,460
Rachel Robertson,

1335
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,320
um,

1336
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,780
is a,

1337
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,880
is a fine author.

1338
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,880
And she says that,

1339
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,199
uh,

1340
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:30,099
leadership isn't a title.

1341
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:30,639
It's a,

1342
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:32,380
it's a set of behaviors and,

1343
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:33,460
um,

1344
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,219
and I,

1345
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:34,460
and,

1346
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,059
and essentially that's it for me,

1347
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:36,320
you know,

1348
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,980
self-leadership for me is,

1349
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:38,579
is having,

1350
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:39,960
because there's,

1351
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,639
there's always,

1352
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,960
we can be leaders in many ways or what type of leadership is it?

1353
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:45,400
You know,

1354
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,900
is it a toxic type of leadership or is it a,

1355
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,400
a really positive,

1356
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:50,219
um,

1357
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,000
influential,

1358
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,340
um,

1359
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,559
not even influential is not the right word.

1360
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:55,360
Is it,

1361
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,300
is it a positive,

1362
00:55:56,699 --> 00:55:57,099
um,

1363
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:58,699
um,

1364
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,900
is it in the right space type of leadership?

1365
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:03,280
And if you get,

1366
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,780
if the set of behaviors that personally you,

1367
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,159
you live by and the,

1368
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:08,579
you know,

1369
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,480
we always talk about values and behaviors almost in the same context.

1370
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,780
If they're all in the right spot,

1371
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,559
um,

1372
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,260
if you're going to have any influence on,

1373
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,139
on yourself,

1374
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:17,780
uh,

1375
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,639
or anyone else,

1376
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:20,920
then it can only be positive if you,

1377
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,940
if you get all that right.

1378
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,300
So,

1379
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,619
um,

1380
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,019
self-leadership for me is to make sure that,

1381
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:26,619
um,

1382
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:27,139
you know,

1383
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:27,539
day in,

1384
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,559
day out that I'm,

1385
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:29,900
I'm true to who I,

1386
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,059
who I believe is,

1387
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:32,739
is a good person and,

1388
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,179
um,

1389
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,340
and making sure that you behave in a way that society expects you to.

1390
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,260
Yeah.

1391
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,619
Beautiful,

1392
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,039
uh,

1393
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:39,420
answer.

1394
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:42,360
And I think anyone who's had any time with you would not question that in,

1395
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,219
in any way,

1396
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,900
shape or form.

1397
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,800
It's the essence of you.

1398
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,079
And,

1399
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:45,340
uh,

1400
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,000
you know,

1401
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,420
for me from the youngest possible age,

1402
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:47,860
um,

1403
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,239
you know,

1404
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,719
I've seen that about you.

1405
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:49,860
We,

1406
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,840
we see leaders really consciously thinking about how they positively impact others in

1407
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,440
their environment.

1408
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,920
And that's another,

1409
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,519
uh,

1410
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:57,320
essence of you.

1411
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,460
But do you consciously think about that positive impact on others?

1412
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:01,760
Yeah,

1413
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:01,940
I,

1414
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,420
I do.

1415
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:02,840
And I,

1416
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:03,659
I think it,

1417
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:04,360
you know,

1418
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,320
the essence of,

1419
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:05,760
um,

1420
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,000
use the word essence again,

1421
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:07,260
but,

1422
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:07,980
um,

1423
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,039
leaders sometimes can be really outspoken and,

1424
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:12,599
uh,

1425
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:12,980
and we,

1426
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,059
we need to be at different times,

1427
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:17,579
but the listening aspect is critical,

1428
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:18,460
you know,

1429
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:18,699
and,

1430
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:22,860
and ensuring that people feel enabled and,

1431
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,260
uh,

1432
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,460
and that they've got their own space and that they can be influential.

1433
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:27,619
And if you don't,

1434
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:28,500
um,

1435
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:30,539
listen and contextualize and,

1436
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:33,380
and just nudge and guide rather than tell and,

1437
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,480
and push,

1438
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,360
uh,

1439
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,079
then you're not going to allow others to become who they should be in a positive

1440
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:39,460
way.

1441
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,320
And I'm sensitive to,

1442
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,199
um,

1443
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,199
not just our,

1444
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,119
well,

1445
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,159
our playing group are critical in that space,

1446
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:46,460
but,

1447
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,119
but our,

1448
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,639
our coaches and people who we work with,

1449
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:50,760
um,

1450
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,880
listening and,

1451
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,460
and seeing what they want to do in their own influential space and,

1452
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,980
and helping them on their way is,

1453
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,760
I think is as critical as,

1454
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,659
as me,

1455
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,659
um,

1456
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,360
taking something in a direction.

1457
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,320
Yeah.

1458
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:06,420
Brilliant answer.

1459
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:07,739
How do you go about,

1460
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:08,239
uh,

1461
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,340
creating and sharing your vision?

1462
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,780
I know this is a real passion area for you about how you do it.

1463
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,300
Can you share a bit about how you go about,

1464
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,719
you know,

1465
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:17,760
creating and sharing that vision?

1466
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,480
Yeah,

1467
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:19,780
I,

1468
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:21,920
I think we,

1469
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,260
we got some,

1470
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:23,340
um,

1471
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:24,519
and if you,

1472
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:25,719
if you talk to people in,

1473
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,559
in different,

1474
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:27,739
sectors of,

1475
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,519
of commerce,

1476
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:29,500
um,

1477
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:29,820
you know,

1478
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:29,940
the,

1479
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,219
the old death by PowerPoint,

1480
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,320
um,

1481
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:32,940
you know,

1482
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,480
will come up.

1483
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:33,719
I,

1484
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,159
I went through some horror years at,

1485
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,820
in,

1486
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:37,199
uh,

1487
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,559
in government agencies where,

1488
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,320
you know,

1489
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,599
new initiatives or,

1490
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:41,559
um,

1491
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,179
things that needed to be executed,

1492
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,219
um,

1493
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,679
were being rolled out in,

1494
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:49,019
in an educational sense.

1495
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:49,219
And,

1496
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,519
and you'd get a PowerPoint presentation,

1497
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:52,599
um,

1498
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:53,579
come across your,

1499
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,139
your shared drive and you go and look at it and it's 90,

1500
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:56,599
uh,

1501
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:57,159
slides.

1502
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,079
How's this going to go?

1503
00:58:59,079 --> 00:58:59,380
You know,

1504
00:58:59,380 --> 00:58:59,800
when you,

1505
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,920
if you've got an audience of 60 people and you're going to tick through 90

1506
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,380
slides,

1507
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,920
what's their capacity of that?

1508
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:06,699
And,

1509
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:07,300
and so,

1510
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,039
but the question back then,

1511
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:10,380
because the understanding of,

1512
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,159
um,

1513
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:12,400
effective learning and,

1514
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:15,280
and the right way to get messages across,

1515
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:17,619
it isn't considered well enough in,

1516
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:18,539
in,

1517
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:19,119
uh,

1518
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:19,940
in different sectors.

1519
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,480
We don't really understand how important it is to get it right.

1520
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
So as far as,

1521
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,559
um,

1522
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,420
I usually try and take a bit of a different angle and,

1523
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,900
and it's mostly around,

1524
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,159
um,

1525
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:35,159
the power of connection and,

1526
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,559
and also the,

1527
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,139
some of that metaphoric language and the escapism.

1528
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:41,219
And it's okay to,

1529
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:42,179
for other,

1530
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,820
for things that are sort of a bit abstract to resonate with you,

1531
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,480
if it gets the most out of you and other people.

1532
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:49,139
And,

1533
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:49,539
um,

1534
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,239
and for,

1535
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:51,659
it's okay for the,

1536
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:51,940
you know,

1537
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,579
whether it's music and,

1538
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:54,679
and movies or,

1539
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:55,300
or literature,

1540
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,000
it's okay for that to be the connector,

1541
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,980
for that to be the medium that brings us together.

1542
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,039
It's not artificial.

1543
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,380
It's what we enjoy.

1544
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,139
It's what we love.

1545
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,599
And there's a real power in that.

1546
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:07,739
And so I probably try and do it,

1547
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,360
you know,

1548
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,639
in,

1549
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,000
in ways that are a little bit left field than,

1550
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:11,800
than,

1551
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:12,440
uh,

1552
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,699
than the words and the,

1553
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,139
um,

1554
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:16,280
and the historical language around leadership.

1555
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,139
Yeah.

1556
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:17,679
It's a great,

1557
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:18,039
uh,

1558
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:18,940
strength of yours.

1559
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,099
And,

1560
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:19,559
you know,

1561
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:20,039
as I said,

1562
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,260
the authenticity comes through when you,

1563
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,659
when you hear your ideas and your thoughts on it.

1564
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,079
Um,

1565
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:25,360
you know,

1566
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,239
curiosity is something where it seems a common trait in leaders.

1567
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:28,659
They're,

1568
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,840
they're curious and they approach their learning and their development often

1569
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,360
through curious.

1570
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,420
And you listen to your life and,

1571
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:37,199
and you love absorbing material and content and,

1572
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:37,860
and reading.

1573
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,260
Do you,

1574
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,059
do you think about your learning through,

1575
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:40,940
through being curious?

1576
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,219
Yeah,

1577
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,719
I do.

1578
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,079
And I love the word curious.

1579
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,059
There's a,

1580
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:45,699
um,

1581
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:48,340
a great book called the explorers.

1582
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,000
Um,

1583
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,000
and T.E.

1584
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:51,739
Lawrence is,

1585
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,260
is Lawrence of Arabia.

1586
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:53,619
You know,

1587
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:54,960
when I was a young kid,

1588
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,219
you know,

1589
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:58,420
there were all these old movies and Lawrence of Arabia kept,

1590
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,139
um,

1591
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:01,219
showing itself on,

1592
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:01,559
on,

1593
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:02,260
on a channel,

1594
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:02,860
um,

1595
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,900
at some point in time.

1596
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,039
But in this explorers book,

1597
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,900
it talks about curiosity being one of the seven traits of the great explorers.

1598
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:10,199
Um,

1599
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:10,900
and,

1600
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:12,119
you know,

1601
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:14,119
essentially if you are,

1602
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,079
um,

1603
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:17,619
a great explorer or an explorer in,

1604
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:19,039
in any sense of the word,

1605
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:21,360
you're trying to get out of your comfort zone and,

1606
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,960
and then explore new things.

1607
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:23,579
Um,

1608
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:24,820
and so,

1609
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,619
being ever curious about,

1610
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:27,519
um,

1611
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:28,519
what's out there,

1612
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:31,860
what you might be able to learn from or use or,

1613
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:36,179
or even the life experience and the physical aspect of being in the ocean or,

1614
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:37,780
or what the different,

1615
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,360
um,

1616
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:40,159
what different environments can throw at you.

1617
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:40,820
I,

1618
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,519
I think it's,

1619
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:41,800
it's,

1620
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,719
it's a word that really resonates with me.

1621
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:44,219
And,

1622
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,219
you know,

1623
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,500
we,

1624
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:46,440
uh,

1625
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,400
we don't talk about internal themes and messages too often,

1626
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:49,719
but,

1627
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:50,880
um,

1628
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:51,480
you know,

1629
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:52,820
part of the historic,

1630
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,860
um,

1631
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,059
message around,

1632
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:55,380
you know,

1633
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,760
I think a lot of people were inquisitive about salty dogs,

1634
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,019
you know,

1635
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:01,340
back when we won the flag and,

1636
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:02,179
you know,

1637
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:02,380
that,

1638
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,179
that internal theme and the text,

1639
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,019
um,

1640
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:05,980
uh,

1641
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,380
you know,

1642
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,099
in the,

1643
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:10,179
in that book is about facing your fears and,

1644
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:10,940
um,

1645
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,139
and,

1646
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,780
and being curious and being okay with that.

1647
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,719
And even if it doesn't work out for you,

1648
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,239
and I think that's the thing,

1649
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:18,659
um,

1650
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:21,360
is feeling okay about it not working out,

1651
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:22,059
um,

1652
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,840
when you've explored your curiosities.

1653
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:24,880
Yeah,

1654
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,119
it's,

1655
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:25,440
it's,

1656
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:25,900
it's brilliant.

1657
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:26,320
And,

1658
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:26,820
you know,

1659
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:27,539
as you said,

1660
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:27,780
they're,

1661
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,300
they're private,

1662
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,519
often the internal themes,

1663
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:29,820
but,

1664
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,159
uh,

1665
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,019
generous enough to open up about that.

1666
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:32,219
And,

1667
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,440
uh,

1668
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,500
and you share with me a copy of that book,

1669
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:34,699
which,

1670
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,460
which I loved,

1671
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:36,119
uh,

1672
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:36,280
uh,

1673
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,159
for those listening,

1674
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,500
you know,

1675
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:37,960
to have,

1676
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,579
you know,

1677
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,380
players armed with something that's meaningful from you and,

1678
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:41,659
and,

1679
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:42,659
and that bonding,

1680
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:43,079
it,

1681
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,099
it seems abstract,

1682
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,440
but it had massive impact on me reading it.

1683
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,059
And then looking back and understanding what,

1684
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:48,940
what you created,

1685
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,559
it's,

1686
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:50,639
it seems as though,

1687
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,519
you know,

1688
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:52,519
it might be left of center,

1689
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,420
but there is a connection that works with it.

1690
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:54,739
Uh,

1691
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
is it hard to land for you?

1692
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,019
I mean,

1693
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:57,280
do you,

1694
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,280
do you ever not land them?

1695
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,619
Do you ever,

1696
01:02:59,159 --> 01:02:59,599
do you ever?

1697
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,380
Absolutely.

1698
01:03:00,539 --> 01:03:00,900
Yeah.

1699
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,239
And,

1700
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,059
and I think,

1701
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:02,300
you know,

1702
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,400
some of our best,

1703
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,380
um,

1704
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:04,940
ones,

1705
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:05,320
yeah,

1706
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,800
cause you can't reuse them.

1707
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:07,699
Um,

1708
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:09,239
I don't think I've ever reused one,

1709
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:09,480
but,

1710
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:10,519
uh,

1711
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:12,659
some of your best ones just haven't,

1712
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:13,539
haven't worked out.

1713
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:13,900
And,

1714
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,199
um,

1715
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:15,880
but I think young Sam,

1716
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:16,519
uh,

1717
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:17,239
Sam Darcy,

1718
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,300
um,

1719
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,300
Marcus,

1720
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:20,280
and,

1721
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,099
and this is part of,

1722
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:21,519
you know,

1723
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:22,260
he's influenced,

1724
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:22,500
but,

1725
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:23,500
he,

1726
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,559
he presented the new seven players at the club with,

1727
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,900
with the Salty Dogs book a couple of weeks ago.

1728
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,659
So Sam's,

1729
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,519
Sam's got a copy.

1730
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,599
It's part of the indoctrination of our new players.

1731
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:33,340
And to understand,

1732
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:33,599
hey,

1733
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,059
we need you to do this.

1734
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:36,599
It's okay to,

1735
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:36,980
um,

1736
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,239
to feel uncomfortable about it.

1737
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,860
But essentially from here on in,

1738
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,019
you,

1739
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:41,800
you step into,

1740
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,440
you know,

1741
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,840
a bit of a new world.

1742
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,300
And if you're not,

1743
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,079
um,

1744
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,019
exploring outside of your own comforts,

1745
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:49,300
then you,

1746
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,300
you're probably not,

1747
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,139
um,

1748
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,400
getting the most out of yourselves.

1749
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,699
And you,

1750
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:53,619
and it's,

1751
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:54,300
and ultimately,

1752
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:55,400
um,

1753
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,139
you know,

1754
01:03:56,139 --> 01:03:56,539
you're not,

1755
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,300
you're not doing what the team really needs you to do.

1756
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,280
And so I imagine it's a pretty quick read.

1757
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:03,039
Um,

1758
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,219
but I'm hoping that all of our new players who received that text,

1759
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:06,920
um,

1760
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,059
it's,

1761
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:08,420
uh,

1762
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:10,460
it's probably to play somewhere,

1763
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,159
whether it's in a drawer or whether it's,

1764
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:12,460
you know,

1765
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,000
stored away.

1766
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,960
I'd like to think that they know where it is.

1767
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,320
It's a simple message.

1768
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:16,980
Um,

1769
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:18,000
but yeah,

1770
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,900
ultimately the,

1771
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:21,539
the week to week angles that we take.

1772
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:22,079
Yeah.

1773
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,239
You always take a risk.

1774
01:04:23,619 --> 01:04:24,019
Um,

1775
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:25,000
but I,

1776
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,300
I,

1777
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:29,500
I'm a great believer that you've got to put the work in and you've got to make sure that,

1778
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:29,900
um,

1779
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,099
it's fresh.

1780
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:31,840
Um,

1781
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:32,699
it's real,

1782
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,159
it's new.

1783
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:33,539
It's,

1784
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:34,019
um,

1785
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,980
there's a creative aspect that doesn't go too far that,

1786
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:39,139
that your players and your team appreciate.

1787
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,280
Um,

1788
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:40,900
but,

1789
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,079
but ultimately you've got to bring it back to them and,

1790
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:44,880
and the team.

1791
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,099
And,

1792
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,400
and there's a way to do that.

1793
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,739
And yeah,

1794
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:48,860
I'll put the hand up.

1795
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,119
And so I haven't always got it right.

1796
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:50,699
Yeah.

1797
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:52,059
For those listening that don't understand,

1798
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,400
there's a unique sort of history going on for my son's 18 and Sam,

1799
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,880
and he's just been drafted under Bevo's care as a,

1800
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,239
as an old teammate and now going full circle Bevo and,

1801
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:02,579
and,

1802
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:02,840
and,

1803
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,840
and then seeing it from a parent's eyes and hopefully is there in the background to,

1804
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,780
to support and,

1805
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,179
and he's going to live his own chapter,

1806
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,260
however that plays out.

1807
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,500
But I loved it.

1808
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:12,619
If you don't mind me sharing this,

1809
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:12,880
uh,

1810
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,000
I felt the first cup,

1811
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:15,239
different era we played in and,

1812
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,800
and even to get a word with a senior coach or I felt even for them to know who you,

1813
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,760
who you were or anything about you was a stretch,

1814
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:21,960
but,

1815
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,019
probably understandable given the time.

1816
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:25,480
But one of the first things,

1817
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:25,960
uh,

1818
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,539
you did was,

1819
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:29,619
was pick him up and take him to dinner at your house with Dana and,

1820
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:30,980
and Beck and I,

1821
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:31,139
my,

1822
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:31,400
we,

1823
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,679
we love this because to me,

1824
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,440
I would have been that nervous about going to senior coach's house and I wouldn't think

1825
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:35,820
about what I,

1826
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,519
what I was going to say.

1827
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,039
His main concern that night Bevo was that there's two things he doesn't eat,

1828
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,260
pumpkin and bananas.

1829
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:41,579
He said,

1830
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:43,280
what if Bevo serves pumpkin soup?

1831
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:43,739
And I said,

1832
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,619
it looks like you're eating pumpkin soup,

1833
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:45,960
my,

1834
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:46,380
uh,

1835
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,219
my young friend.

1836
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:47,539
So,

1837
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:47,820
um,

1838
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,699
new generations,

1839
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,019
they think differently.

1840
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:51,880
I'll,

1841
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,659
I'll move on to,

1842
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,039
um,

1843
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:54,460
to the next dimension of leadership.

1844
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:54,840
There's a,

1845
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,900
there's a couple more communicating with clarity is something we're identifying with leaders.

1846
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,119
Do you think about the way you communicate?

1847
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:02,559
Yeah,

1848
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:03,000
absolutely.

1849
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:03,500
And,

1850
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:03,940
um,

1851
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:04,360
yeah,

1852
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,599
setting the scene and providing context,

1853
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:07,559
um,

1854
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,280
is,

1855
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,880
is absolutely critical for,

1856
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:10,880
uh,

1857
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:12,539
for all of our,

1858
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:13,840
all of our people.

1859
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:14,579
Um,

1860
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,800
but I think it gets back to,

1861
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:17,460
you know,

1862
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,940
the learning mediums,

1863
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,320
you know,

1864
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,000
and to continue to think about,

1865
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,320
uh,

1866
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,340
how do you,

1867
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,739
in a group,

1868
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,940
in a group setting,

1869
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:29,739
how many can actually process the spoken word?

1870
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,079
You know,

1871
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:30,639
is there,

1872
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,380
if you speak for 10 minutes,

1873
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,599
what are they going to take in?

1874
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:36,900
Most of us,

1875
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,219
I think,

1876
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,760
have got a real appetite for the visual mediums,

1877
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:39,940
you know,

1878
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,159
whether it's pictures or videos and,

1879
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,340
and it's such an effective way to get your message across.

1880
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,400
And,

1881
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:47,900
um,

1882
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:48,380
and the,

1883
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,739
the physical side of it,

1884
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:49,980
you know,

1885
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,300
actually,

1886
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:50,840
you know,

1887
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,300
whether you're working with people,

1888
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,219
walking through or demonstrating and,

1889
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,079
and,

1890
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,239
and being physically active,

1891
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:56,860
which you can't always do in a,

1892
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,900
in a normal workspace.

1893
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:58,719
Um,

1894
01:06:59,139 --> 01:06:59,340
he,

1895
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,820
he's really valuable in what we do,

1896
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,159
obviously,

1897
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:01,519
we're,

1898
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:01,880
you know,

1899
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,599
in a high skill game sense,

1900
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:04,780
um,

1901
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:06,000
type discipline.

1902
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:06,860
But,

1903
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,380
um,

1904
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:08,280
but yeah,

1905
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,579
so as far as the communications go,

1906
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:13,019
exploring the,

1907
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:14,920
the best mediums,

1908
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,360
um,

1909
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,079
reminding people how they can do it better.

1910
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:18,719
And,

1911
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,219
uh,

1912
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:21,059
and that constant loop of feedback,

1913
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:23,639
especially with our coaches as they think about this,

1914
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:24,380
you know,

1915
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,460
understand your audience.

1916
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,360
Um,

1917
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:27,920
because the one-on-one,

1918
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:29,000
um,

1919
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:30,739
connection is a little bit simpler.

1920
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,980
It's just when you,

1921
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:35,039
when you've got a group catering for all is,

1922
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:35,380
is,

1923
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,500
is the most challenging.

1924
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:37,079
And,

1925
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:37,440
um,

1926
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,380
and I think,

1927
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,679
you know,

1928
01:07:38,739 --> 01:07:39,460
I probably,

1929
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:40,440
you know,

1930
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,039
as far as the spoken word goes,

1931
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:42,260
I,

1932
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,519
I've always been,

1933
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:44,860
uh,

1934
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,840
somewhere between a mumbler and,

1935
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:48,320
and a reasonable orator.

1936
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,239
Um,

1937
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:50,659
and I get,

1938
01:07:50,659 --> 01:07:50,699
you know,

1939
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:50,960
you can,

1940
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:51,579
you can get lazy,

1941
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:52,280
you know,

1942
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:52,440
and,

1943
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,539
and I think I'm,

1944
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:53,860
I'm,

1945
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:56,639
I've become more conscious about pronouncing,

1946
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,800
um,

1947
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,619
my words a little bit better because I,

1948
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:00,239
I,

1949
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:00,519
I've,

1950
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:01,300
I've been,

1951
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,559
I'm pretty laid back most of the time.

1952
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,460
And,

1953
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:06,400
and I think that can be construed as,

1954
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:07,400
um,

1955
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,559
you know,

1956
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:10,019
almost being a,

1957
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,059
um,

1958
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,739
it starts to connect to connect you with your history.

1959
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:16,220
And if you,

1960
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,279
you come known as,

1961
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,920
as a skateboarder more than a coach,

1962
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:19,659
you know,

1963
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:20,060
so,

1964
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,039
so,

1965
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:21,659
uh,

1966
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:21,699
I,

1967
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:22,060
I,

1968
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,380
I've become a little bit more mindful of,

1969
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,439
of pronouncing my words and,

1970
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:26,800
and,

1971
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,859
and making sure that,

1972
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,199
um,

1973
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:30,380
I get the message across in a fluent way.

1974
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:33,119
We're seeing leaders really value collaboration,

1975
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:33,380
Bevo,

1976
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,079
maybe more in this generation than ever before.

1977
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,239
How do you view collaboration?

1978
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:39,939
Oh,

1979
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,180
that,

1980
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,920
it's interesting when you consider with,

1981
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:46,020
you know,

1982
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,600
what we do as coaches and,

1983
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,279
and managers,

1984
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,819
we've all got some kind of ego.

1985
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:51,779
You know,

1986
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:52,000
we've,

1987
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,439
we're all come from a,

1988
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:54,079
um,

1989
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,560
a self-belief platform or premise at times and,

1990
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:01,760
and collaboration for me is really understanding or,

1991
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,140
or acknowledging that you definitely haven't got all the answers and we really

1992
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,140
need to listen and open,

1993
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,659
open ourselves up to,

1994
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:09,520
um,

1995
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:10,420
conversations.

1996
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:11,640
And,

1997
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,640
and I think if you've got a really intense,

1998
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,539
um,

1999
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:19,699
sort of self-absorbed and overarching egotistical,

2000
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:20,060
um,

2001
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:20,619
um,

2002
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,199
egotistical way of doing things,

2003
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,579
you're going to be less collaborative,

2004
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:24,579
um,

2005
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,500
and you're going to miss out.

2006
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:25,840
So,

2007
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:26,859
you know,

2008
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:27,359
I,

2009
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:27,880
the,

2010
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,960
we mentioned these really influential coaches like Brian Gordian and Ange and

2011
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,220
Neil,

2012
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:34,859
um,

2013
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:35,739
Neil Craig and,

2014
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,979
and Eddie Jones.

2015
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,119
And there's a,

2016
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,979
there's a deep seated humility in their personalities.

2017
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:44,020
They don't think they've got all the answers.

2018
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:44,800
They're willing to listen.

2019
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:45,779
They're willing to talk.

2020
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,300
And it's a reminder to,

2021
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,140
to me and to anyone who,

2022
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:51,060
who,

2023
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:51,359
uh,

2024
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,020
who wants to better themselves that you need to go in with an open mind,

2025
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:56,619
contribute where you can,

2026
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,460
but really learn from others.

2027
01:09:58,699 --> 01:09:58,920
Uh,

2028
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,520
I just think it's absolutely critical that you park the ego,

2029
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,600
um,

2030
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:03,119
and,

2031
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:04,720
and you have a good time with it and you,

2032
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,619
and you really take away the nuggets,

2033
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:07,880
write your notes,

2034
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:08,859
um,

2035
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:11,640
take an angle from what someone else has said,

2036
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,279
as is there's so much to benefit from,

2037
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:14,840
from other,

2038
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,359
what other people's experience has been and what they've got to say.

2039
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:18,939
Yeah.

2040
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:19,880
Beautifully said,

2041
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:20,220
uh,

2042
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:20,439
again,

2043
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:20,600
mate,

2044
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,460
two final questions.

2045
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,060
We've been asking,

2046
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:22,520
uh,

2047
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,140
all the leaders I've been fortunate enough to sit alongside and enjoy this

2048
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:26,800
experience.

2049
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,000
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

2050
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:33,300
Greatest leader in my life.

2051
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,159
Oh,

2052
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,000
what's your second question?

2053
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,039
Can I come back to that one?

2054
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:37,439
Yeah.

2055
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,680
A bit of think time.

2056
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,260
Uh,

2057
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,380
if you could collaborate with anyone in the world and it could be on anything,

2058
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:42,699
Bevo,

2059
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,359
it could be your love of surfing.

2060
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:47,800
It could be coaching collaboration where we're interested in.

2061
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,659
If you could collaborate,

2062
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:49,960
it might be in a rock band,

2063
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:50,340
Bevo,

2064
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,479
who would you collaborate with?

2065
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:52,420
Well,

2066
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:55,760
right at this point in time,

2067
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,960
I'd say Peter Garrett.

2068
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:57,979
Is that right?

2069
01:10:58,079 --> 01:10:58,279
Yeah.

2070
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:04,920
I've been thinking a lot about Peter Garrett and I've always admired him fiercely.

2071
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:05,520
My,

2072
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:07,539
my interests,

2073
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:08,819
my desire to,

2074
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:09,600
uh,

2075
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,880
be more influential in,

2076
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,079
in the first nations space and recognition of,

2077
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:15,560
you know,

2078
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,300
indigenous rights and reconciliation has,

2079
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,800
has really escalated over the,

2080
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,119
the last few years.

2081
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,039
A good friend of mine,

2082
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:24,800
David Quinn,

2083
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:25,819
uh,

2084
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:28,779
Paul Thompson have been influential there behind the scenes with me.

2085
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,520
Obviously Peter has,

2086
01:11:30,939 --> 01:11:31,239
you know,

2087
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:33,359
had a huge passion in that space.

2088
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,399
He's,

2089
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:34,939
um,

2090
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:37,680
he's want to,

2091
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:37,939
uh,

2092
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:38,399
influence,

2093
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:39,039
you know,

2094
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,340
our thinking around the environment.

2095
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,800
And obviously a lot of the,

2096
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:42,260
um,

2097
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,760
a lot of the songs that Minot Oil have sung and,

2098
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,020
and that they've written over the years have,

2099
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:47,680
have been,

2100
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,260
you know,

2101
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,340
really sensitive to the environment and definitely first nations people.

2102
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,920
And his journey for me has been fascinating,

2103
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:55,220
you know,

2104
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,239
for him to go into politics and,

2105
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:59,279
and not last a long,

2106
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:01,039
long time at federal level.

2107
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,880
I'd love to sit down and talk to him about why not,

2108
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:04,699
because for me,

2109
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,260
he's just one of the most standup,

2110
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,180
um,

2111
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,579
characters that Australia has ever,

2112
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,760
um,

2113
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,380
had the benefit of,

2114
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,319
of being exposed to.

2115
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,560
And when you think of the diversity of,

2116
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:20,340
of him,

2117
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,199
you know,

2118
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:21,760
as a,

2119
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,159
as a,

2120
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,500
as an artist in the music industry,

2121
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,100
but then as a politician,

2122
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,260
um,

2123
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:30,520
and as a freedom fighter and a rights preserver,

2124
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,500
what an amazing person.

2125
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,319
So I'd,

2126
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,279
he'd be probably number one in the,

2127
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:37,180
in the way I've been thinking recently.

2128
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,079
Um,

2129
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,880
because I just think he's just such a,

2130
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,319
an amazing human being.

2131
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:42,060
And,

2132
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:42,260
uh,

2133
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,600
he'd be probably at the top of my list.

2134
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:48,779
And the courage to go on the inside and go through the path at his age.

2135
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:49,680
And he could have had,

2136
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,180
you know,

2137
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,560
toured around the world and,

2138
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,460
and kept doing that.

2139
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,739
That would have been a pretty hard thing to give up.

2140
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:54,300
I suspect,

2141
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:54,739
you know,

2142
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:56,079
mid-air at all for that period of time.

2143
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,880
But I'm going to go in and try and,

2144
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,979
unless it changed from the inside and then the hand grenades got thrown at him everywhere.

2145
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:05,199
But the humility of his exit and the class with which he,

2146
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:05,560
you know,

2147
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:08,020
with all sorts of mud being thrown his way,

2148
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:08,420
you know,

2149
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:08,739
it'd be,

2150
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:09,880
it'd be a great conversation.

2151
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:10,500
I'd love to hear.

2152
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,159
Absolutely.

2153
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:13,340
A transcript of you two getting together.

2154
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:14,479
So I've given you some think time,

2155
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:14,659
mate,

2156
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:14,779
on,

2157
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,800
on the greatest leader in your life.

2158
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,119
Is there anything or anyone,

2159
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:20,159
or is it a handful of people?

2160
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:21,420
Yeah,

2161
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,840
I mean,

2162
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,420
so many influential people on the way to us,

2163
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:29,239
but the guy who stands out for me is a guy named Neil Jensen.

2164
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:37,960
Neil was the one who set up the financial intelligence units in Australia.

2165
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:38,460
He,

2166
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,560
he was CEO of AUSTRAC,

2167
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:47,840
but the Australian FIU and the Canadian FIU were the most powerful financial intelligence units in the world.

2168
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,140
Now he was involved in helping other countries,

2169
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,159
set their own up,

2170
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:52,739
um,

2171
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,500
where essentially,

2172
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:54,420
you know,

2173
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:54,619
the,

2174
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,020
the data capture and the analytics around trying to detect money laundering,

2175
01:13:59,319 --> 01:13:59,960
um,

2176
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,979
and the mechanisms that surround that.

2177
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,539
He was the one who was guiding and influencing,

2178
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,739
um,

2179
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,939
AUSTRAC really has got two main offices or back when I worked there,

2180
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:10,840
um,

2181
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,680
and one's in New South Wales and one's here in Melbourne.

2182
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:13,939
And,

2183
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,199
and Neil happened to be based in,

2184
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:17,420
in Melbourne at the time.

2185
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:18,180
And,

2186
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:18,619
um,

2187
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:20,760
and what struck him?

2188
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,779
What struck me was he would walk the floor as a CEO.

2189
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:25,079
He'd,

2190
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:26,220
he'd talk to everyone.

2191
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,779
He'd shake hands with those he could.

2192
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:33,260
He knew everyone by their name and he'd call them by their name.

2193
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:33,560
And he,

2194
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:39,899
he was at pains to make sure that anyone new to the agency would feel welcome.

2195
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:40,220
And he,

2196
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:41,220
he was a CEO.

2197
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,380
Other people could do that,

2198
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,340
but he felt it was important for him.

2199
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:45,960
And this is a government agency.

2200
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,140
This isn't a private,

2201
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:48,180
um,

2202
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,420
entity that he owns or runs.

2203
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:50,699
Yeah.

2204
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:51,060
He,

2205
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:52,640
you might say,

2206
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:52,899
well,

2207
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:53,720
he,

2208
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:55,199
it's not part of his roommate,

2209
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:55,600
you know,

2210
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:56,520
but he,

2211
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:58,560
he thought it was absolutely critical.

2212
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,880
And there was a real power in that because people knew he cared.

2213
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,060
And so as far as,

2214
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:04,960
um,

2215
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:08,600
the influence from the top down and the relationship piece,

2216
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,920
it was really strong.

2217
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,619
There were great connections there at AUSTRAC.

2218
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:12,779
And,

2219
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,180
and the reason why he stands out so much is he retired.

2220
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,939
And during the,

2221
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:19,420
uh,

2222
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,399
transition into,

2223
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:21,319
uh,

2224
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:22,260
the new legislation,

2225
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:25,739
they recruited a lot of senior management from other government agencies.

2226
01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:30,300
And there was a new CEO who came in and the whole environment changed.

2227
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:33,340
And that personable,

2228
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,159
um,

2229
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:37,979
caring aspect of the organization went within the space of six months.

2230
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:39,100
And,

2231
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:45,039
and I realized how much of an influence Neil Jensen had on AUSTRAC as an agency.

2232
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,239
And for me,

2233
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:50,579
it was just so tragic that that agency now was in the,

2234
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,460
the state that it was.

2235
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,920
And I experienced the change and that even the toxicity that now existed,

2236
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:56,640
um,

2237
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,460
in some of the teams because it wasn't being led well.

2238
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,420
And,

2239
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:00,579
uh,

2240
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:03,960
it was fascinating to me to see the two extremes.

2241
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:04,319
And,

2242
01:16:04,539 --> 01:16:05,039
and so,

2243
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:05,279
yeah,

2244
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,100
he was a great example for me of how to do it right.

2245
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,779
That strikes such a chord,

2246
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:10,199
Bevan.

2247
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:13,239
I'm glad you shared that story because it goes to the essence of what,

2248
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:13,680
you know,

2249
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,699
I'm really passionate about and we're really passionate about in this leadership space is that your ability and the way you described that,

2250
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,300
it's not a,

2251
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:26,100
a really big thing to do to know people's name and shake their hands and make them feel special in that moment.

2252
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,260
But your ability to impact people and change their lives,

2253
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:31,239
we spend so much of our time at work.

2254
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:34,180
So for those people then to have that removed,

2255
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:41,579
then it was probably someone who just didn't have the leadership skills or the understanding or hadn't put time into or may have been well-meaning,

2256
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,199
didn't understand the impact,

2257
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:47,659
but you can cause misery by the environment you create.

2258
01:16:47,779 --> 01:16:50,199
And for a lot of people feel trapped there and that affects their,

2259
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:50,579
their family,

2260
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:51,960
that affects their relationships,

2261
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,260
affects their kids.

2262
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:59,199
It's a massive flow on effect because we're not sharing the idea that we can be better in this space.

2263
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,779
So I'm glad you shared that story.

2264
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:02,319
It really,

2265
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:04,300
it's the essence of what we're really trying to capture.

2266
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:05,239
Absolutely,

2267
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:05,859
Darson,

2268
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,119
you know,

2269
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:06,920
just quickly,

2270
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:07,960
there's no doubt,

2271
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,439
Neil Jensen saw the worker and the person,

2272
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:11,300
you know,

2273
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:19,960
his empathy and his range took over when he was talking to Luke Darcy as a person rather than Luke Darcy as the administrative clerk or whatever your role might have been.

2274
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,060
Yeah,

2275
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:27,140
he was more interested in how you were and how your family was than he was in you doing a good job.

2276
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:27,659
And,

2277
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,300
and that meant that the,

2278
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:32,079
that worker was compelled or felt,

2279
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:32,579
you know,

2280
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:38,619
some responsibility and drive to do a good job because he knew or she knew that the CEO cared about them.

2281
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:39,500
Um,

2282
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:44,119
and I think that's a challenge for people in authority or in senior positions.

2283
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:46,460
If they haven't got great depth,

2284
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,119
um,

2285
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:47,960
emotionally,

2286
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,960
they need good people around them,

2287
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,739
to help them with that or to help the staff with that.

2288
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:54,720
Um,

2289
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:55,260
and,

2290
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,300
and recognizing that in any organization is,

2291
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,000
is a critical starting point.

2292
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:00,680
And,

2293
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:01,020
uh,

2294
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:01,859
but Neil did it right.

2295
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,680
I went to school with,

2296
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,119
uh,

2297
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:05,000
um,

2298
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,600
a young fellow named Matt Connell and Maddie and I don't,

2299
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,960
we don't see each other anymore.

2300
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:12,619
And the most humble person I ever met in my life.

2301
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,439
And he never wanted any credit for,

2302
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,279
for anything.

2303
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:18,380
And,

2304
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:19,720
and I think he,

2305
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,060
he taught me a lesson as a,

2306
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:23,119
as a young fella around,

2307
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,000
you know,

2308
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,180
when to step back and,

2309
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,560
and when to step forward.

2310
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:27,760
And,

2311
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:28,460
um,

2312
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:29,840
and he was,

2313
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:30,180
he,

2314
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,079
he was the epitome of,

2315
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,659
of almost being too humble,

2316
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,359
you know?

2317
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:35,520
And,

2318
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:35,920
um,

2319
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,100
and I look for that,

2320
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,899
that humility in,

2321
01:18:38,979 --> 01:18:39,960
in leaders and,

2322
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:40,960
um,

2323
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,600
and dispersing recognition in,

2324
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,500
uh,

2325
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,279
in good times,

2326
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:47,779
but the willingness to,

2327
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:48,239
uh,

2328
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:48,920
to,

2329
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:49,260
you know,

2330
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,699
take responsibility when,

2331
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,380
when things don't go so right.

2332
01:18:52,939 --> 01:18:53,380
Um,

2333
01:18:53,659 --> 01:18:54,539
and,

2334
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,060
and so I,

2335
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:56,500
you know,

2336
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:56,699
I,

2337
01:18:57,039 --> 01:18:57,319
I,

2338
01:18:57,319 --> 01:18:57,579
I,

2339
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:57,619
I,

2340
01:18:57,619 --> 01:18:58,560
at the moment I,

2341
01:18:58,859 --> 01:18:59,720
like in my life,

2342
01:18:59,800 --> 01:18:59,920
I,

2343
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:01,460
I don't know,

2344
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:03,859
there's probably not been one standout,

2345
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:04,659
uh,

2346
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:05,079
person,

2347
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:05,600
but if I,

2348
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:06,279
you know,

2349
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:06,960
I think about it,

2350
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,140
you were on the political spectrum and you,

2351
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:09,939
you think about,

2352
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,159
say Jacinda Ardern at the moment and,

2353
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:16,800
and she just seems to me like a very strong woman who's got the balance right,

2354
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,779
um,

2355
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:18,699
in that regard.

2356
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:19,659
Um,

2357
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,119
also,

2358
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,039
um,

2359
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:22,039
I've gone down a political,

2360
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,960
political angle a little bit here.

2361
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,659
Um,

2362
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:25,520
but it,

2363
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,340
but it is a,

2364
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,500
it is something that I,

2365
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,180
I really look for in a great leader is,

2366
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:31,079
is that humility.

2367
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:31,840
And,

2368
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,199
um,

2369
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:34,500
there have been some outstanding ones and,

2370
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:35,220
um,

2371
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,479
I just wish I could spit them out at the moment.

2372
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,539
Could I ask you to go childhood friend?

2373
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,180
Why don't you see each other?

2374
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,720
Is it just the evolution of life and.

2375
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:43,399
Yeah,

2376
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:43,819
essentially.

2377
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,119
I mean,

2378
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:44,380
we,

2379
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:44,899
we,

2380
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,119
after year 10,

2381
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:46,539
we,

2382
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:47,180
sorry,

2383
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,500
after our secondary schooling,

2384
01:19:48,699 --> 01:19:48,880
we,

2385
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,220
um,

2386
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,140
yeah,

2387
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,359
we just parted ways and,

2388
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:52,880
and Matt went off and studied and,

2389
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:54,079
um,

2390
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,579
and yeah,

2391
01:19:55,579 --> 01:19:57,720
we just don't see each other anymore,

2392
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,300
unfortunately.

2393
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:58,760
And,

2394
01:19:58,899 --> 01:19:59,699
uh,

2395
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:00,119
he,

2396
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:00,539
uh,

2397
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:06,420
it's interesting that I think all of us felt the same way about Matt and for him to be,

2398
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,800
he was such a,

2399
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:08,579
um,

2400
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:10,399
as far as football goes,

2401
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:14,319
he was such a hard in and under type physical player.

2402
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,960
And then off the field,

2403
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,300
he was,

2404
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,180
he was such a,

2405
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,239
a generous caring type person.

2406
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:20,539
And my,

2407
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,239
my,

2408
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:21,920
my father,

2409
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:22,579
John,

2410
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,279
um,

2411
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:25,659
brought me up on a appetite on a,

2412
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,300
on a menu of,

2413
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,199
um,

2414
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,819
mean Joe green who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

2415
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:37,159
And Joe green was famous for being just such a great and beautiful human being off the

2416
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:38,500
field and,

2417
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:38,819
uh,

2418
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:40,300
being caring and generous in,

2419
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,479
in what he did for others,

2420
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:43,560
but on field across the white line.

2421
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:43,920
And it's,

2422
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,319
he's,

2423
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,060
he's a different,

2424
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:46,479
different person,

2425
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:47,720
a different customer.

2426
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:48,859
Um,

2427
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:51,060
ferocious in the way he played the game.

2428
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:52,140
And,

2429
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:52,539
uh,

2430
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,779
and that balance of,

2431
01:20:53,859 --> 01:20:57,100
of on and off field has always resonated with me.

2432
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,619
And,

2433
01:20:57,739 --> 01:20:58,000
uh,

2434
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,960
and so I look for that,

2435
01:20:59,319 --> 01:20:59,859
uh,

2436
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:00,220
in,

2437
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:00,920
in other people,

2438
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:01,840
the competitiveness,

2439
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:02,659
but the,

2440
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,600
um,

2441
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:04,340
you know,

2442
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:04,500
the,

2443
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,260
the lighter side in them and that they're,

2444
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,439
they're willing to,

2445
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:08,020
um,

2446
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,380
show their emotions and,

2447
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,659
and reach out and care and,

2448
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:11,479
um,

2449
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,340
and definitely praise and,

2450
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,300
and,

2451
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,640
and make other others feel good about themselves,

2452
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,640
um,

2453
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,340
at any opportunity.

2454
01:21:18,859 --> 01:21:19,220
Well,

2455
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,979
I think I said that one stage at the start of this Bevo,

2456
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:22,640
uh,

2457
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:25,180
I found very hard to get the words out to,

2458
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:25,779
to describe you.

2459
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:27,279
Maybe you did it yourself with Joe Green.

2460
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:28,680
I'm not familiar with his work,

2461
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,760
but that empathy,

2462
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,619
that care for others,

2463
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,819
being a great human being,

2464
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:34,399
but also fiercely competitive and loyal.

2465
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,039
Uh,

2466
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:40,060
I look forward to reading more about him because that is who I'm staring in front of a unique leader in every sense,

2467
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,300
mate.

2468
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:40,739
I've always,

2469
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:41,060
uh,

2470
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,500
valued the fact that we crossed over and,

2471
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:43,859
um,

2472
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:44,640
I love spending,

2473
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:45,039
uh,

2474
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:45,920
any time with you.

2475
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,859
So thanks for joining us today.

2476
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,260
Very flattering,

2477
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:48,720
Darcy.

2478
01:21:48,859 --> 01:21:50,000
I appreciate it.

2479
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:50,220
And,

2480
01:21:50,579 --> 01:21:50,899
um,

2481
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:51,800
you know,

2482
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:52,539
what you're doing,

2483
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,020

2485
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,659

2486
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:57,100
uh,

2487
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:59,199
and I'm really grateful to be a part of it.

2488
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:00,100
So I really thank you.

2489
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:00,979
Thank you for that.

2490
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:01,180
And,

um,

2492
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:03,680
I've really enjoyed the chat.
