1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,580
I really loved the conversation this week on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,439
It truly was a great pleasure to sit down with five-time Olympian

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,000
and the 2010 gold medal winner, Lydia Lassler.

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,739
Listening to Lydia's story, hearing about her attitude towards excellence

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,699
was incredibly insightful from her early years making the tough decision

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,579
to give up a sport she loved to then move into a completely new area.

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,659
Her attitude towards parenting and now her thoughts on business

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,320
and entrepreneurship, incredibly insightful.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,219
Her documentary, The Will to Fly, is brilliant and was labelled

10
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,380
by the Huffington Post as 2016's most inspiring film.

11
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,240
This crossover between sport and leadership is something that I have been exploring

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,179
at the business I co-founded with my great friend Matt Waterwitz called Alita.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
It's a place where leaders can collaborate and learn from one another.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,560
We've been fortunate enough to work with some incredible leaders

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,579
in our program, Ange Postacoglu from Celtic, Arsenal's Mikel Arteta,

16
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,340
the Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Mike Dunlap, just to name a few.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,299
And if you're interested in this space, you don't need to be a global superstar coach

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,079
to be part of it.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,159
You can find all about it at alitacollective.com.

20
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,359
I encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program

21
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,540
to understand how people like Lydia are collaborating and leading in their world.

22
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,299
Lydia Lassler was awarded the prestigious The Don Award by the Sport Australia Hall

23
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,540
of Fame for her gold medal winning performance in the aerial skiing

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,260
at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.

25
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,180
Four years later, in the Olympic final in Sochi, Lydia became the first female ever

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,180
to attempt a quad twisting triple somersault known as a back full double full full,

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,500
a feat at the time that was only considered available to the men.

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,159
And despite not landing that jump, her courage was rewarded with a bronze medal.

29
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,579
Lydia's brilliant documentary about her life, The Will to Fly,

30
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,280
has motivated and inspired many with her courage.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
Perseverance and dedication.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,699
Lydia, it's always great to see you.

33
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,900
It's been a long while and nice to see you on the line from Finland today.

34
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,639
Yeah, it has been a while.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,900
Thank you for having me.

36
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,080
It's great to see you as well.

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,159
Now, Lydia, I loved going back and watching your story again.

38
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,319
The documentary is just brilliant.

39
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,199
I encourage everyone, if you haven't seen Will to Fly,

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,319
it's easily accessible on Apple or lots of platforms.

41
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,400
It's just incredibly inspiring to watch it again.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,379
But I didn't realize, the youngest possible age, Lydia,

43
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,280
you had in your mind about being an Olympic champion,

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,659
Olympic gold medal winner.

45
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,379
Tell us about where that came from.

46
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,800
Oh, it started early.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,740
It was probably around six years old.

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,340
So, and I, we were on a family trip to Cyprus where my dad's from.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,259
And we're sitting in this beach cafe in the 1988 Olympics we were on at the time.

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,960
And I was just, you know, kind of transfixed to the TV

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,439
while we're eating our tarra masalata, you know, in the beach

52
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,219
and just looking, what the hell is this?

53
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,259
What's this race?

54
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:09,199
You know, they're swimming.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,379
And there's running and there's all kinds of sports.

56
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,300
And, yeah, that was probably my first introduction to the Olympics

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,740
and just watching these athletes standing on top of the dice and crying

58
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,360
and, you know, the idea of, I guess, the best competing against the best

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,419
in something, you know, just really, it drew me in.

60
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,419
It really did.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,740
It's something that I've always fell in love with, you know,

62
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,659
the Olympic movement.

63
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,219
But, yeah, I think from that early age,

64
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,180
I really believe that was something that I was meant to be.

65
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,699
You know, I was meant to be in some kind of sport.

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,219
I didn't know what at the time, but I wanted to stand on top of that dice as well.

67
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:55,560
And, yeah, I think individual sports probably were more appealing to me.

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,219
But, yeah, just to be that individual, you know, having stood up on that dice is,

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,379
yeah, it was really compelling.

70
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,620
For a young kid that just didn't really know anything about structured sport

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,180
and didn't have the background.

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,659
Gymnastics was the early passion.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,939
You're an outstanding junior gymnast.

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,779
And then you got injured.

75
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,480
How unlikely was it from that moment on, I think it was around 16,

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,620
that you would go on and become an aerial skier?

77
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,240
Look, so many unlikely things have happened in my life.

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,680
So I'm just, you know, living in Finland at the moment.

79
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:35,319
And who would have thought I'm living in Lapland, the North Pole?

80
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,319
So.

81
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,699
So strange things happened.

82
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,139
And, you know, it was like those sliding door moments, I suppose.

83
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,139
But, yeah, I didn't make it as a gymnast, which was gutting, I think, for me,

84
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,139
because I knew I had the potential to.

85
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,120
But long story short, you know, I just missed opportunities there.

86
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,639
And then, yeah, got injured and just had to make that call,

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,819
which was horrible because, you know, you're young

88
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,819
and you feel like your whole world's kind of crashing down

89
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,339
because that gymnastics was up to that.

90
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,680
But at that point, my passion and my life, you know, I really loved it.

91
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,180
And it was my community and growing up with three older brothers,

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,759
it was a way for me to just get away from my brothers

93
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,720
and do something different as well, you know,

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,079
and be able to just stand on my own on something.

95
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,540
They wouldn't let me win anything else.

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,019
So it was an important part of my life.

97
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,060
And I just always knew, like, I had what it takes, you know,

98
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
to be the best.

99
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:42,660
And so for that to be kind of a non-event and to just not happen

100
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,959
was pretty gutting for me.

101
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,660
So I had to make the decision to stop because I was also realistic

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,199
and I'm like, it's not going to happen.

103
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,980
But I was looking for something else to do.

104
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,959
And at that time, I had, you know, as a gymnast,

105
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,379
I had a pretty good skill set in a lot of different areas.

106
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,540
I was very strong and disciplined and motivated.

107
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,339
So I looked at something.

108
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:11,019
I was kayaking at one stage and even rowing and loved the beach

109
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,319
and loved, you know, spending time at our holiday house down in Lawn.

110
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,660
So I loved surf lifesaving.

111
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,100
I grew up watching, you know, the Uncle Toby series

112
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,839
and wanted to do that as well or surfing.

113
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,819
So there was lots of, like, options of, like, where can I go?

114
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,579
What can I do?

115
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
I still want to be an athlete.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,519
And at that time, the Olympic Winter Institute had this really great idea

117
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,279
of recruiting ex-gymnasts.

118
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,279
They were first in the world to do so, recruiting ex-gymnasts

119
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,100
and seeing if they had the skill set or if we could develop the skills

120
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,319
for them to convert into aerial skiers.

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,060
So it was innovative because we, in Australia,

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,899
we didn't have a large pool of, you know, skiers.

123
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,860
It's not our main sport.

124
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,519
It's a short winter season.

125
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,100
But we do have a lot of ex-gymnasts.

126
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,300
And at the time, there actually wasn't much of an avenue, you know,

127
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,300
for us to go into.

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,759
Like, the college gymnastics wasn't really a thing.

129
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,879
And I did have a call from Cirque du Soleil at the time,

130
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,600
and they were just starting out.

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,939
So it wasn't big yet.

132
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,220
Like, it wasn't big at all.

133
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,680
And I had a call and they said, oh, look, we know you've retired and, you know,

134
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,480
would you be interested in, you know, coming to join us?

135
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,300
And I'm like, what?

136
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,740
I'm not a circus freak.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,439
No, thanks.

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,939
No, I'm not joining the circus.

139
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,079
Like, I'm better than that.

140
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,160
I could do something else.

141
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,000
And had I known it was going to be a really good career option,

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,139
and it is what it is today, I might have said yes.

143
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,819
But, yeah, so I turned that down.

144
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,759
But, yeah, so the Olympic Winter Institute got in touch and they said, Lydia,

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,259
you know, we know you're retired.

146
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you want to come and have a bit of a ski at Mount Buller and come

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,759
into the office and we'll introduce you to the sport of aerial skiing?

148
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:04,259
So I went in for a meeting and they put the VHS tape in and showed this

149
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:04,800
highlight.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I was like, oh, my God, this is the highlight reel of what aerial skiing is.

151
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,019
And I was just like, what is this?

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,259
Like, I had no concept.

153
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,519
I was not a winter person and hadn't skied before.

154
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,519
So it was so foreign.

155
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,500
But it looked so cool.

156
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,060
You know, these amazing athletes, you know,

157
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,240
flipping off these huge jumps and doing all these acrobatics in the air.

158
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,819
And, of course, it was a highlight reel.

159
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,220
It didn't show any crashes and it didn't show any hard hits that were to follow

160
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,559
pretty soon after that.

161
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,940
But it looked amazing.

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,919
And I think at the time, you know, seven, I was coming to, you know,

163
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,980
being 18 years old and the idea of, you know, gallivanting off to the mountains

164
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,600
and that time it was off to Canada and to Whistler Blackcomb and, you know,

165
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,100
and experiencing real mountains and real winter and this kind of adventure

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,919
was appealing because I'd, you know,

167
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,940
been this disciplined gymnast stuck indoors for quite a while and told what

168
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:04,980
to do.

169
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,320
So it was like liberating for sure, the idea of it.

170
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,179
But really it was just, you know, just mentioning the Winter Olympics

171
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,019
and I was like, hmm, this is cool.

172
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,059
Yes, please.

173
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,720
I didn't really ask too many questions after that.

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,899
I mean, and then two years later you're in an Olympic final in Salt Lake City.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,919
It's an incredible ability to get there.

176
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,039
And, again, watching back and watching your dog,

177
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,100
you had an incredible level of confidence at that age.

178
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:32,399
Yeah.

179
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,960
And, you know, you told people what you were going to do.

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,779
And, you know, senior people in the sport, you were getting stuck into them.

181
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,039
I mean, where did that come from?

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,659
Where did that full self-confidence come from?

183
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,159
Yeah, it's tricky.

184
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:51,460
Like I was – I think I was progressing really fast and I saw, you know,

185
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,960
a lot of weaknesses in the programs, like in the way competitors trained,

186
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,860
the way – I mean, it still didn't have much structure.

187
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,940
So freestyle skiing was pretty loose.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,500
When I started, still, like people rarely warmed up and the gym was just a thing.

189
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,600
And, you know, they were, you know, having a good time on the weekends.

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,700
And so it was actually, yeah, pretty loose.

191
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,379
And there was a really big gap between, you know,

192
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,799
the females and where the males were at when I started.

193
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
And I could just see those opportunities.

194
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,659
I saw them as opportunities.

195
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm like, oh, I want to close that gap, you know, want to fill that hole.

196
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,080
Because I couldn't understand why there was such a big gap

197
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,940
and why there was such a big gap.

198
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,779
There was such a big difference in skill level at the time.

199
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,860
It didn't – it doesn't – it's not explained by physical strength.

200
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,120
Like a lot of other sports, you can kind of easily say, well,

201
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,820
men are stronger than women or whatever you want to say.

202
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,080
But, like, it just – it's not that kind of sport.

203
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,320
It's very skill-based.

204
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,600
And, you know, you had six-foot guys doing these amazing tricks

205
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,899
and you had five-foot three guys doing these amazing tricks the same size as me.

206
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,059
So, you know, so it wasn't really based on any kind of physical, you know,

207
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
body set or anything like that.

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,100
And so I just saw opportunities.

209
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,000
And so I was a bit, you know, cocky.

210
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,299
I was very cocky at the start and just saying I'm going to be –

211
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,519
I've really believed that I'm going to be the one that's going to close those gaps

212
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,379
and I'm going to be, you know, setting a new benchmark, I suppose,

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,840
for the female aerial skiers.

214
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:23,620
And that was the mission.

215
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,860
That was like, right, that's the job, you know.

216
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,179
And that's what I wanted, you know.

217
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,179
I wanted to win everything.

218
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,460
But I also wanted to be a groundbreaker.

219
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,720
I think even more so.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,379
Like I think that's what really drove me every day, training with guys,

221
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,919
making sure my quality was at the same, you know, standard

222
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,500
or nipping at their heels as best as I could.

223
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,519
So with time and, you know, and I guess if you look at the program's evolution,

224
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,840
like when I started it was very unstructured and myself

225
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,580
and my teammate that was chosen at the time as these, you know, rookies

226
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,299
or basically guinea pigs to see if this process of turning gymnasts

227
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,799
to aerial skiers was going to work.

228
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,039
It went from being quite loose to then now, you know, 20-something years later,

229
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,960
like it's so structured and it's beautiful, it's meticulous, you know.

230
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,899
There's processes in place for our athletes.

231
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,820
There's training facilities in Australia.

232
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,000
They've got all the services they need.

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,980
There's medical support, which, you know, we didn't have when we first started.

234
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,500
And psychological.

235
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,600
Psychological support and, you know, to see all that kind of change over the years,

236
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,779
it's a beautiful process to witness.

237
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,299
Come back to the groundbreaking part of what you did and it's fascinating

238
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,419
that you had that, you know, such an early part of your career in a sport

239
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,080
you knew nothing about.

240
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,899
You'd never skied before, but in your mindset you're going to, you know,

241
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,620
break new ground.

242
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,820
I find that incredibly fascinating.

243
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,120
And as you said, they show you a tape of the highlight reel.

244
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,720
They don't show you how many times you're going to fall down.

245
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,820
Now, again, I watched.

246
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,200
I did it again last night.

247
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,399
I had seen it before, but it just reminded me of how ridiculously courageous

248
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,220
you and your colleagues are to sit at the top of that mountain.

249
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,539
You know, you've blown ACLs out before.

250
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,580
We'll talk about that.

251
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,399
To know, I still couldn't watch the replay last night.

252
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,379
You know, having done an ACL play footy before, I still find it hard to watch ACLs.

253
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,820
Same.

254
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,320
Let alone saying, okay, I'm in an Olympic final.

255
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,019
You know, I've had surgery.

256
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,059
There's a massive chance if that goes wrong,

257
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,059
I blow my knee out again.

258
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,259
Tell us about how you found and some of the crashes.

259
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,379
You had in training were just ridiculous.

260
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,980
You know, like it just looked like you were going to kill yourself at some stage.

261
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,679
I mean, how did you find that mental toughness?

262
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,879
What sort of practices did you get to get that resilience and mental toughness?

263
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,879
I think at the start of my career, like, you know, we talk about being a bit cocky

264
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,679
and probably mostly it was more to do with naivety, I suppose.

265
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,659
It was just, let's face it, the less you know, sometimes the better.

266
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,679
But, yeah.

267
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,860
It probably started with my coach at the time, his German coach.

268
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,100
And I was just learning how to ski.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,740
And he said, Lydia, Salt Lake City Olympics are in less than two years.

270
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,279
If you train really hard, there's an opening for you.

271
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,419
Because it wasn't like four women get selected onto the team and, you know,

272
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,539
there wasn't enough women.

273
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,240
So I'm like, right, you know, it's on.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,179
Yeah.

275
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,860
And so it started, the recklessness started there.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,179
Let's just call it recklessness.

277
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:37,980
Because it wasn't really monitored and it wasn't, I was just all go.

278
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,259
You know, I had some great things going on.

279
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,879
I was determined.

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,159
I was improving very quickly.

281
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,779
I had come in with a good skill set.

282
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,100
I had great balance.

283
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,139
I had great feel and all of those things, good acrobatic skills.

284
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,840
So, you know, it was a nice, smooth transition.

285
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,899
But on top of that, I put the work ethic in, you know, and I had talent.

286
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,100
So you mix those two.

287
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,440
You mix those two things together and you've got a good recipe, you know,

288
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,539
for success.

289
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:15,100
And so probably my biggest asset at that stage and my biggest downfall was the

290
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,320
amount of volume that I could pump out in terms of repetition,

291
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:29,519
in terms of hours on the hill, and had this ability to do enormous volumes

292
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,960
without getting bored.

293
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:40,779
And so my first jump to my 60th jump of the day would be the same or maybe even

294
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,519
better, whereas, you know, people kind of trailed off at about 20, you know,

295
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,120
and couldn't do the volumes.

296
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,460
So it was great because I improved really quickly and in no time had the skills

297
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,440
to compete in the Olympics.

298
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,759
But I didn't rest and I didn't, you know,

299
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,740
periodise and I didn't have any recovery and I didn't have any physio and, you know,

300
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,940
like I just burnt my body to the ground without realising at that point that it's going

301
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,600
to need to carry me another 15 years, you know.

302
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:22,840
So I was injured probably most of my career and in pain for a lot of it.

303
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,879
And it started early.

304
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,960
And so, you know, going into Salt Lake City, I was,

305
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,379
I had a cyst in my spine.

306
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,559
My left leg was going numb.

307
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,720
So I was going crooked off the jump because I couldn't feel the same balance

308
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,059
on my two skis.

309
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,019
You know, I had a torn shoulder that, you know,

310
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,740
slapped lesion and slapped hair in my shoulder that needed surgery afterwards.

311
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,120
I was an absolute mess.

312
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
But here I was believing that I could win a medal there.

313
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,159
I honestly went in thinking, nah, I can win a medal, you know,

314
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,500
and I had no business being there.

315
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,899
It was my first ever year competing actually that year.

316
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,720
And so I made the,

317
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,100
I made the finals and finished eighth place and my teammate,

318
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,880
Elisa Camplin, who was at the peak of her career, you know, won.

319
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,720
So a crazy kind of self-belief, which I have no idea where that came from,

320
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,440
and a good ability to block out pain and the fear associated with that.

321
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,359
Because at the time I remember being really frightened for my life,

322
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
actually, because I was really struggling.

323
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,460
I was, you know, skiing off crooked off the jump,

324
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:30,759
which.

325
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,440
Is not good in the air because then you're landing, you know,

326
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,720
crooked and then you're landing heavy on one leg and, and then, you know,

327
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,839
you get really quite beaten up on, on, you know, lopsided almost, you know,

328
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,160
so, so body was just in terrible shape.

329
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,740
And it took me after those Olympics,

330
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,799
it took me a good two years to iron myself out and kind of get straight again.

331
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,859
And, and even now, if I don't look after, you know,

332
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,740
that back injury and, and, you know, knees and shoulders and things like that,

333
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,579
that have kind of come over the years, um, yeah, I'm in trouble, you know?

334
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,380
So self-management is, you know, really important thing these days,

335
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,359
which I didn't really care or didn't really take into account then,

336
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,000
and had no one to really guide me and say, Liv, you, you know,

337
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,079
you're doing a bit too much, let's slow it down a bit,

338
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,900
or I think your shoulder's torn or, you know,

339
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,460
In fact, you're insane, Lydia, we need to give you a break.

340
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,339
We need to, I mean, there was a bit of vision reminding, uh, where you, you,

341
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:34,359
you had a, uh, pre-Olympic tournament at the Bird's Nest, uh, stadium in China,

342
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,039
and they, uh, they build the, the slope inside the stadium,

343
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,519
and then you look up and there's not a net to the left.

344
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,339
No.

345
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,160
And you think if, if, if you, if you get that wrong,

346
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,859
you're literally, someone's going to die.

347
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,380
Yeah.

348
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,039
And you're catching an elevator up to that height.

349
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,779
I've got an insane fear of heights.

350
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,000
I felt nervous just watching it again to, to, to watch it.

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,380
I mean, I'm fascinated.

352
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,420
You say you had a great ability to deal with pain and, and clearly you did.

353
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,960
Great ability to overcome fear.

354
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,000
And I, you know, watching your eyes on the top of those slope, knowing that you've got

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,079
those things going on with a torn shoulder, I mean, was there something specific to, is

356
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,119
it just who you are or did you learn some techniques to be able to control that nervous?

357
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,319
Because a lot of people listen to this who, you know, who are anxious, who struggle with,

358
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,920
you know, uh, fear and anxiety daily.

359
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,819
I mean, how can they tap into a bit of Lydia Lassoy?

360
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:22,819
Yeah.

361
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:27,200
And I, you know, I was scared a lot, you know, and, and pain a lot and worried a lot, especially,

362
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,759
you know, starting to do these triple somersaults.

363
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,839
And, you know, you go to bed at night and you're like, oh gosh, my knees really saw

364
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,440
or, oh gosh, it's going to be a blizzard tomorrow.

365
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,039
I hope I get through it, you know, like, like those kinds of feelings, um, going to bed

366
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,900
at night, which is not, I don't miss that at all now sitting in the comfort of my home,

367
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,059
you know, a few, few years on and sipping a cup of coffee, like I don't miss that feeling

368
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,000
of being anxious and worried and scared.

369
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,759
Um, but, um, over the course of my career, you know, I wised up.

370
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,759
Like.

371
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,779
I started out reckless and then 2006 Torino Olympics, where I blew my knee at the Olympics

372
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,940
for the second time in six months was the end for me, um, in terms of being reckless,

373
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
that was it.

374
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:17,140
I didn't want that up and down, you know, um, cycle of being injured and coming back

375
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,500
out of it and having to fight back and cause I was good, you know, I was really talented

376
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,819
and really good and I knew I could win an Olympics.

377
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,380
So I reached out for help.

378
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,839
So I think step one, anxious, depressed.

379
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:37,819
Worried constantly, or feeling like you are not where you want to be, not where you should

380
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:44,059
be, like don't worry about should or could or what, where you want to be, um, reach out

381
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,059
for help.

382
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,180
Set one, I think like, and I, and at that point I, you know, blown my knee and I, and

383
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,220
everyone else was kind of, well, you know, you get the feeling people are going to start

384
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,019
to write you off after you've blown your knee twice and they start to think, well, I don't

385
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,759
think she's going to have the heart or the.

386
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,859
Courage to, or the, to come back, you know, and be able to be successful and you feel

387
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:05,859
that.

388
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,519
And, but inside I was like, no, that's not going to happen.

389
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,119
You know, like I know I can do this.

390
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,900
I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.

391
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,299
And I need help.

392
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:24,660
And so after, you know, 2006 and probably in the lowest point of my career, I just found

393
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,740
I'd, I'd been reading, um, I've been reading some books on, on, um, um, um, you know, um,

394
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,880
like I've read heaps of mental training books just to try and get an edge and to give me

395
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,859
the skillset to be able to calm down in stressful situations.

396
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,319
And you can learn so much.

397
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,119
You learn so much from these days, podcasts, you know, it was amazing.

398
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,680
Like you can learn so much, but I read a lot of books and, um, the book, one book that

399
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,940
really resonated with me was a book called sports mind.

400
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,420
And if you're actually, if you're an athlete, it's a, it's a, it's like a Bible.

401
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
It's amazing.

402
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,859
Um, but if you're anyone.

403
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:57,859
Yeah.

404
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:01,680
And I read it and I thought that I should read it as a book.

405
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Because I read it every single day when I went to the gym.

406
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
And I think so.

407
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,599
I've got, I've read it every single, every single day.

408
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,660
So the book is pretty strong.

409
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,359
I was so, so proud of it, um, but yeah, so, so, and this book talked a lot about that.

410
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,900
And so I did read it.

411
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,359
And what it did for me was I read it and I was like, you know, the most important thing

412
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,559
I'm, I'm, I'm so excited to read this book because it's so, so important to me and, I'm

413
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,019
so, so happy to read it.

414
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:27,140
I love it.

415
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,519
I love it.

416
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:27,579
And I read it.

417
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:32,539
I have, you know, the funds at the time to engage Jeffrey Hodges,

418
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,380
the author, and he's from Queensland.

419
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,660
He's amazing, probably the most pivotal person in my career

420
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:46,400
and really focused on NLP, so Neuro Linguistic Programming.

421
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,660
So he's not a psychologist but he's an NLP trainer and, you know,

422
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,619
quite incredible.

423
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:55,900
And read his books.

424
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:57,279
They really resonated with me.

425
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,420
He bought his CDs and on the CDs there was, you know, these lectures

426
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,960
but I guess lectures on self-confidence, visualisation,

427
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,759
positive mental attitudes, motivation, like how to do all these things,

428
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,859
like real tangible skills.

429
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,160
And, you know, I just listened to them religiously really

430
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,980
and also with those with daily visualisations,

431
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,900
which really helped me a lot, unpack a day and get ready

432
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,960
for the next one, you know.

433
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,259
And so after Toreen.

434
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,460
I thought, bugger it, I'm going to give this guy a call

435
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,700
and I flew up to the Sunshine Coast and went and saw him

436
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
and, you know, took him through what I'd kind of been through

437
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,519
and felt like I knew him already because I'd been reading his material

438
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,519
for so long and listening to his voice on the visualisation tapes

439
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,759
and he looked at me straight in the eye and he said,

440
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,119
Lydia, you've created everything that's happened to you.

441
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,960
And I'm like, you know, how disordinary.

442
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,099
You've just come out of surgery.

443
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm like, you bastard, that's really mean.

444
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,079
And, you know, because every thought, you know,

445
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:13,599
then leads to some kind of action or behaviour and you do that long enough

446
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,140
and it becomes a habit and a pattern.

447
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,740
And he was spot on that I was, you know, a lot of the things I'd done

448
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,920
in the past, the past Lydia, that overtrained,

449
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,779
that had some limiting beliefs.

450
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,359
But, you know, one of them was if you work hard, you'll be successful.

451
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,180
And so he taught me how to change that and how to flip that

452
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,240
and just transform that belief, you know, about working smarter,

453
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,140
not harder, you know.

454
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,519
And then there was a positive shift.

455
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,839
From there it was a change and he taught me the skills on, you know,

456
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,019
there's so many little techniques and when you're standing up on top

457
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,480
of the hill and there's so many distractions that could possibly come in,

458
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:56,720
you know.

459
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,400
Someone might say something or a bird might fly in front

460
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,119
or someone might crash just right in front of you, you know,

461
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,880
and something bad, you know, has happened just in the jump before

462
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,819
or you've just had a bad crash and you're trying to pick yourself up.

463
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,180
And in those moments, you know, the skills of just being present,

464
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,140
you know, being where you are and understanding your cues.

465
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,279
So, okay, I could think about all the bad things that are going

466
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,279
to happen to me right now or I could actually just focus on the things

467
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,619
that are going to let me do this.

468
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,339
Jump safely and successfully.

469
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,720
So, hit your take.

470
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,559
And just keeping those kind of things really simple, you know,

471
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,759
and you practice that long enough and it becomes habit.

472
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,900
And so when you get into those situations and stressful situations

473
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,940
and rather than being a deer in a headlight, you know,

474
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,599
where you just freeze and you don't know what to do,

475
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,079
you can pull out the, you know, the tools out of the tool bag and go,

476
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,700
right, this one for this one, you know, this one for this one.

477
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,319
And breathe and all of these things that help you just stay present,

478
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,640
stay in that place where you can actually focus and be confident.

479
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,059
You know, it's a state that you can change instantly just

480
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,960
by the way you carry yourself, by the way you talk to yourself, you know.

481
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,599
Yeah, and being able to set yourself up for a good day by asking empowering

482
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,460
questions, not ones that will disempower you.

483
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,700
What if I don't do this?

484
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,339
You know, or I don't feel I've prepared enough or I always get nervous

485
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,740
in front of the crowd or, you know, whatever it might be for you.

486
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,339
Like listen to the way, I guess, you're speaking to yourself

487
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,119
and just try and reframe it.

488
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,259
But there's so much.

489
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,700
There's so much, I think, mentally that we can all learn and do.

490
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,859
But it just, you know, like that make a really big difference

491
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,740
and it just as much as we train our muscles, I think it's so important

492
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,700
that we actually train our minds so it doesn't kind of, you know,

493
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,759
lead us down that rabbit hole and get out of hand.

494
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,039
If there's ever a sport or an athlete to sum that up, you know,

495
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,140
brought to life again for me just seeing, you know,

496
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,920
it's pretty immediate, isn't it, when you've got a ramp

497
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,000
and you're going at 60 k's an hour and you're going to do four flips

498
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,119
and try and land, you know, if you're not, the risk is enormous.

499
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,799
And I love what you said, you know, reach out and get some help

500
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,880
and, you know, very different sport, Lydia, lucky enough to play.

501
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,099
But always when you're out of form and you're anxious about,

502
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,420
geez, am I good enough?

503
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,880
To play and you start thinking about wanting to play this great game,

504
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,980
you're in that space straight away or you can't control that outcome

505
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,299
but you could always go back to things that, you know,

506
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,720
help you to be good in the first place that you could control,

507
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,039
how hard you worked or how hard you ran or how you supported your teammates

508
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,720
or how you used your voice or there are all these things

509
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,079
that no one could take away from you.

510
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,220
And when you're sort of drilled into that, you know,

511
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,500
it tended to make life a lot easier rather than that anxiety around,

512
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,660
geez, if I don't kick five goals, I'm in a world of trouble.

513
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,960
I love hearing it from you all.

514
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,539
You know, sports point of view.

515
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,140
I want to go forward, Lydia.

516
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,960
It's the quad twisting triple somersault.

517
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,500
It just, it looks like the most ridiculous thing anyone would ever think

518
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,759
to attempt in their life.

519
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:09,700
Busy.

520
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Busy is one word.

521
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,000
I would describe it again as crazy.

522
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,079
And you do it in an Olympic final.

523
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,480
You know, you build up to that.

524
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,940
You're a mother at that stage and, you know,

525
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,059
you're already an Olympic gold medalist so you've done everything you needed to do.

526
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,359
The fact that you had the motivation to do it, but, I mean,

527
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,059
it was such an amazing.

528
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,819
It was such an amazing thing to attempt an Olympic final.

529
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,259
Tell us why that was so big for you.

530
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,180
Look, at the time, it was just on my bucket list kind of thing, you know.

531
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,460
It was something that had drove me through the sport, you know.

532
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,660
When I said before, like, I wanted to jump like a guy and that was,

533
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,440
if I could do that trick, that meant that I had achieved that, you know.

534
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,440
And so my goals, I guess, were, yes, I wanted to win an Olympic medal,

535
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,319
but once I'd won that or actually Olympic gold medal, that's what I wanted.

536
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,640
But after that, it's kind of like, what now?

537
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
What haven't I, you know, kind of done yet?

538
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,720
And there's still lots of things left undone.

539
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:11,400
Don't get me wrong, but that was one of them.

540
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,519
That was an important one, one that when I got to Olympic finals,

541
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,319
prepared to kind of sacrifice everything for, you know.

542
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,119
So it was what motivated me for that quad.

543
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,019
I'd had a baby.

544
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,420
I had Kai, my firstborn, after 2010, after I'd won.

545
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,299
I'd had time off, which I believe every athlete should do.

546
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,759
It just gives you great perspective, have a break from the sport,

547
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,099
find some other things that in life are fulfilling

548
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,640
and that you can see yourself doing after sport, I suppose.

549
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,859
That was really important for me and helped my transition.

550
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,559
But then, you know, I had Kai and, again, people thought,

551
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
oh, she's not going to have the heart to come back.

552
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,140
And, you know, it's like being injured.

553
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,599
And I think women are amazing these days.

554
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,099
They're doing all kinds of things, having surrogates and things.

555
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,619
I was like, ooh, that idea did not come into my mind,

556
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,859
but how cool would that have been?

557
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,519
Outsource that one.

558
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,920
I think, yeah, outsource everything.

559
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,019
But, no, it was good growing a baby and coming back from it, you know,

560
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,740
and that whole process was amazing.

561
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,059
And the only reason why I wanted to come back was because I wanted to,

562
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:23,579
you know.

563
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,519
At that point in life, I had a family and had business already set up.

564
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,079
And so the thing that drove me and pulled me back was the sport.

565
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,259
Being an athlete was what I loved to do.

566
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:40,859
And this idea of there's something still that I haven't done yet that I want to do,

567
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,779
you know, and it took me a long time to get there because of injuries and,

568
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,839
you know, like the whole ring marole of being an athlete.

569
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,579
It's not like linear.

570
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,240
It's up and down.

571
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,480
And so I was at that point.

572
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:55,359
I'm like, this is my kind of last push.

573
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,380
I want to get to this trick.

574
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,599
And it wasn't easy.

575
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,799
I had, you know, Kai in tow.

576
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,119
And so I had a lot of help with my mum and my husband, Latay,

577
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,460
and they flew around with me and my mother-in-law as well to help me manage

578
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,839
and cope with being a mum and an elite athlete and, you know,

579
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,079
running a business on the side.

580
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,240
And when I look back now what I was managing at that point in time in my life,

581
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,680
my head kind of spins off because it was a lot.

582
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,220
It was like a lot.

583
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,220
It was a lot of intensity.

584
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:31,440
And so, yeah, that quad was all about that comeback to the 2014 Olympics was

585
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,740
about building up to this quad twisting triple somersault and being the first

586
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,400
woman to do it.

587
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,720
And that's what I wanted.

588
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,079
And so my coach at the time, Mishroth, who coaches, you know,

589
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,019
one of our athletes still, Laura Peel, you know,

590
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,400
he just bought into my ideas.

591
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,099
He really did.

592
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,559
And I think.

593
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,480
I think that's really important to have that support from your coach

594
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,079
and the team around me.

595
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,160
And so my, you know, Geoffrey Hodges at that point was solidified into my team.

596
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:11,200
He was part of the furniture and coach and physios and trainers as well at the VIS.

597
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,160
So they all bought into what I wanted to do.

598
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,960
That was really important because I felt like everyone was on my team and,

599
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,019
you know, because I didn't have to do it to win, you know.

600
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:23,220
And sometimes.

601
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,279
We back down.

602
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
We only do what we need to do to win, you know, nothing more.

603
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,640
Definitely not less, but I didn't need to do it, but I wanted to.

604
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,599
And so got to the, you know, to 2014 Olympics.

605
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,420
I didn't have the preparation that I wanted to.

606
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,859
It was quite a difficult season leading into those Olympics with really crazy

607
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:48,220
weather.

608
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,420
And so being a bit smarter, we had to choose when,

609
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,099
to do this trick, you know, and,

610
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,779
and not to take risks before we actually even get to the Olympics, you know.

611
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,740
And so the opportunity in the window just didn't present itself at our Olympic

612
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,519
training camp.

613
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,279
It was as an average temperature of about minus 25 degrees.

614
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,279
And so it was freezing.

615
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,180
It was cold and, and my body wasn't, you know,

616
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,359
coping and it just wasn't the time to throw this new trick down, you know,

617
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,200
and, and leading into that, you know,

618
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,660
that we just had bad weather days.

619
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:30,619
And so the opportunity to present itself until about three days before the

620
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:36,420
Olympics or maybe even two and actually there in training and,

621
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,740
you know, got, you know, used to the new, new side in Sochi.

622
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,599
And, and so that takes, you know,

623
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,660
a day or so and got up to speed in my tricks and was feeling good.

624
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,279
And, and that was the time I looked at my coach and like, I think,

625
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,160
I think we go like, this is now feeling good.

626
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,960
And like the time.

627
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,900
And so it's at the end of the day, I was, I was the last jumper of the day.

628
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,859
It was starting to get dark and I started to, you know,

629
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,599
visualize doing this trick.

630
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,699
And when you kind of visualize and you start doing the movements,

631
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,159
everyone knows what you're doing.

632
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,579
So all the competitors and the coaches start, you know,

633
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,159
got their phones out and started crowding down at the Olympics.

634
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,940
They could literally, they could see you as soon as you got into that routine.

635
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,780
Everyone's going, hang on a minute, it's on here.

636
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,159
And they heard whispers.

637
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,000
That she's going to do it.

638
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,679
Yeah.

639
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,139
And, or that I'd been training it, but I hadn't done it yet.

640
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,099
Hadn't had the opportunity.

641
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,340
And so everyone's like slid down underneath the jumps and I'm like, Oh God,

642
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,039
here we go.

643
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,000
And, you know, I felt green.

644
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,079
I wanted to vomit and, and, you know,

645
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,639
skied in and, and, and relied on all the, you know,

646
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,920
the training that I had done.

647
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,000
So I'd practice it on, on the water ramps.

648
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,380
I'd practice it on trampoline, but it's still a thing, you know,

649
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,139
when you're doing it for the first time on snow,

650
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,820
it's scary and you just hope everything kind of kicks into gear.

651
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,659
You don't forget and do the deer in a headlight.

652
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,480
Anyway, skied down, went off the jump.

653
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:02,659
I was fine.

654
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,539
I was like, Oh, this is good.

655
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:05,340
I know what I'm doing.

656
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,719
I could see everything and skied away.

657
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:11,820
And I'm like, did it, you know, and this is at the Olympics.

658
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,199
I've turned around and every single person, my competitors, the coaches,

659
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,460
this is, you know,

660
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,199
this is the Olympics where everyone is in game mode and it's the most

661
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,079
competitive environment.

662
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,599
Ever.

663
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,360
They're all lined up and just cheering, you know?

664
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,079
And for me, that was like,

665
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:37,460
the Rocky soundtrack came on and it was my Rocky moment.

666
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,300
It was like, Oh, I did it.

667
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,079
And it was a really cool,

668
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,119
like really cool moment that no one really saw.

669
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,079
Like it, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't executed perfectly.

670
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,199
And, you know, you know,

671
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,059
I skied out of it.

672
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,320
It wasn't perfect, but it was such a milestone, you know,

673
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,579
for me and, and, you know, a lot of the, you know,

674
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:03,860
the women, you know, as well, and looking in and watching it,

675
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,820
the time and coaches that had all been, you know, part of it.

676
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,880
So for me,

677
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,980
that was one of the best moments of my kind of career a couple of days

678
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,659
before the Olympics.

679
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,159
So then anyway, it was done.

680
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:17,559
And, and I, you know,

681
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:21,099
remember going through some video feedback with my coach that night and,

682
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,019
and we made,

683
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:25,219
we made a plan and, and now that it was done,

684
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,760
like it was just so much lighter.

685
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,619
The monkey was off my back and, and he said, look,

686
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:30,800
we're jumping well.

687
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,460
And what do we want to, what do we want to do?

688
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:36,019
If you, cause it, the, the, the,

689
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:39,980
the competition was in fact a brutal format.

690
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,239
It was a good eight hour competition where you had to go through a

691
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,260
qualifying process and it was all elimination.

692
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,460
And then the final 12 would start,

693
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,699
they do a jump and then it would go to eight.

694
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,599
And then four, and then you jump for the finals for,

695
00:36:58,739 --> 00:36:59,579
for the medals, sorry.

696
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,699
So four people at the end, last people standing,

697
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,699
jump for a medal and you don't know what colour you're going to get.

698
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,579
And so I said, look, if we make it to the four, you know,

699
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,820
I think we should go for it.

700
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,739
And he's like, I think you're absolutely right.

701
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,639
So it was a plan that if I made it to the four,

702
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,960
which is hard enough in itself, then,

703
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,920
then we would never back down.

704
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:20,760
We would go for it.

705
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,980
So just an amazing moment.

706
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,260
And sport, I love hearing you tell that story.

707
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,340
And it freaked your opponents out too, didn't it?

708
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,800
A couple of days out before, yeah.

709
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:32,320
They stood and applauded and then it unnerved them all.

710
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,599
They went, if she's got this up her sleeve and she's prepared to do that,

711
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,679
you know, a couple of days out from Olympic competition,

712
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,659
she's next level.

713
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,639
And, you know, this really strong Chinese jumpers, you know,

714
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,559
got off the, put off their game, slightly letting into it.

715
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:47,960
It's brilliant.

716
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,320
If you haven't seen it, you go back and, as I said,

717
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,000
watch the incredible documentary, The Wheel to Fly,

718
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,079
it captures it, that moment, brilliantly.

719
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,679
And I love, as you said, that high purpose around,

720
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,019
you could have played safe in an Olympic final when you didn't.

721
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:04,920
You put it all out there and did something no one else has ever done before.

722
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,519
Can I, can I, you know, there's some questions I want to ask you at the end,

723
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,900
but you mentioned Latte, your husband, who was an outstanding skier for Finland.

724
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:17,639
He represented his country in the 1998 Olympics and the 1999 World Championships

725
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:21,000
and the men's moguls and his support throughout the journey.

726
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,599
You've had two boys, Kai.

727
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,500
And, Alec, can I ask a parenting question?

728
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,400
Because I love asking this from a leadership point of view.

729
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,659
The boys have got two incredibly disciplined, high achieving parents.

730
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,380
I mean, how does that flow through to them?

731
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,659
And what's your leadership like from a parenting point of view?

732
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:37,840
Oh, gosh.

733
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,039
It's, look, parenting's tough.

734
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,159
It's not easy.

735
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:50,139
We, you know, Kai is our firstborn and he's, he's, he's our kind of angel child

736
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,239
that does what he's told.

737
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,800
And we had him and we're like,

738
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,679
oh, we're awesome parents.

739
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,380
And then we had Alec who has a different, different, just, you know,

740
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,719
goes to the beat of his own drum and doesn't really listen to us

741
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,940
and does his own thing and does it his way.

742
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,599
So, and we're like, no, but there's an easier way.

743
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,440
And we know that there is, and you just trust us and do it.

744
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,039
And he's like, no.

745
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,880
So it's about just finding, I think, their strengths, you know,

746
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,079
encouraging them in what they, they like to do and,

747
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,760
and letting them be their own.

748
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,960
And there's, you know, risk in having, you know,

749
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,880
I guess parents that have, you know,

750
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,340
achieved at a high level before and trying to push that then onto the,

751
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,440
onto the children, especially if they're not ready or,

752
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,739
or they don't want it and there's no interest, you know,

753
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,960
and, and we're very mindful of that.

754
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,900
We don't, we instill discipline in,

755
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:51,739
in them in a way that is easy for them to do, you know,

756
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:52,460
make your bed.

757
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,659
Tidy up your clothes, clean up, do chores, like contribute.

758
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,159
And if you're going to do something, you know,

759
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,480
put some effort in and do it well and,

760
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,699
and trying to just give them opportunities,

761
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,179
trying to give them opportunities to say they can try different things,

762
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,619
try soccer, try tennis, try, you know, different little,

763
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,239
different sports that, that they're interested in and,

764
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,719
and finding their strengths, I think.

765
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,460
And, and then, you know, supporting them through that,

766
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,179
then, then giving, trying to just give them, I suppose,

767
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,760
as much opportunity as possible.

768
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,719
So that's, that's,

769
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,059
that's what we try and do when, you know, not definitely not try

770
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,880
and make them fit into, you know, a certain mold or our mold

771
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
or what we think, you know, they should do.

772
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,380
But I guess it comes, what we do have is the ability

773
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,780
to give them some guidance, especially,

774
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,380
particularly if they want to be athletes.

775
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,460
I think we can give them some really great, you know,

776
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,460
great advice and skillset that I didn't have, you know, growing up.

777
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:50,599
But what I did have growing up was support.

778
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,420
Um, no one could understand what I wanted to do or why it didn't make any sense

779
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,079
to them, but they, they supported me.

780
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,500
And so, um, yeah, that's what we try to do.

781
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah.

782
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,960
It's early, early days yet.

783
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,739
Um, and they, you know, showing their interest in,

784
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,400
in certain things and we co-parent, you know, there's no good cop,

785
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,000
bad cop.

786
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,400
We co-parent in a really equal way.

787
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,380
Um, Lattes had to play mum a lot and sometimes I play dad a lot,

788
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,500
you know, and it's just this,

789
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,780
this role that's actually, there is no mum and dad.

790
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,679
It's just the same.

791
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,559
We do the same things.

792
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:29,440
We both work, we both do chores, we both rear the kids, you know,

793
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,500
and, um, and so it feels like a pretty good unit and a really good team,

794
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,099
I suppose.

795
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,559
But yeah, it's a tricky one, isn't it?

796
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,900
Cause like I do watch the kids play sport and, and I'm like, ah, come on,

797
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:46,480
you know, don't, don't, you know, don't, don't give up now.

798
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,159
Keep going.

799
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,039
Come on, keep going.

800
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,219
Oh, listen, make sure you're listening.

801
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:50,199
And, you know, like,

802
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,320
and I want to shout from the sidelines, but I don't, I hold my tongue and you

803
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,260
can't, you just can't, you know,

804
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,860
you can't do that because you can't put that kind of pressure on them.

805
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,940
I don't think as, as young kids, they're just, I don't know if they might,

806
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,860
when you do, I think they, they turn the other way and get discouraged.

807
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,969
Leah, I've loved talking to different people with great leadership and,

808
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,650
and life stories like yours.

809
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,070
And we see common traits of what leadership looks like.

810
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,429
Most people, first of all, don't say, you know,

811
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,670
the term leadership doesn't necessarily resonate with them,

812
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,050
but your life has been incredible story.

813
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,289
And we see everyone's got a sense,

814
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,690
the first dimension I want to talk to you about of self-leadership,

815
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:40,570
this idea of being able to lead themselves first.

816
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:42,969
Does that term self-leadership resonate with you?

817
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,710
What does it mean to you?

818
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,969
Yeah, I think so.

819
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,650
In many ways it resonates, you know, I'm the leader of my life.

820
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,170
So, you know, we have, you know, yeah,

821
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,090
this life because we've engineered it that way.

822
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,909
It's not happened by chance or,

823
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,989
by, you know, some kind of extraordinary gift.

824
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,650
It's been a lot of grit and hard work and steadfast kind of resilience to stick

825
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,250
to what is important to you.

826
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:09,190
So lifestyle for me is important.

827
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,630
Being able to work abroad and, and,

828
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,090
and do what I want to do and give the kids these opportunities is important

829
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:16,530
for me.

830
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,969
So that's something that we've engineered over many, you know,

831
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,150
over many years.

832
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,849
And, and, and so leading your own life,

833
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:27,610
leading others, you know,

834
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,309
I've run a couple of businesses now for nearly 15 years from,

835
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,769
from overseas, from my laptop, from abroad.

836
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:37,309
And so I think, I think I'm a pretty good leader.

837
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:40,070
I'll have to ask everyone later on, but they don't say,

838
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,809
they don't seem to complain too much.

839
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,389
And, and, you know, that whole leading by example is,

840
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,449
is kind of true because, you know,

841
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,489
if I portray self-discipline and then if I give people a go and give them

842
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:54,710
independence to show me what they can do,

843
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,489
um,

844
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:59,610
and, and to do their job without breathing down their back is,

845
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,130
as I do my job without anyone breathing down my back,

846
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,409
I think it empowers people.

847
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:06,030
So I really try to give them the confidence to,

848
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,769
to get the job done, um,

849
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,849
and to,

850
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,889
to develop their skills and to encourage them to develop their skills.

851
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,070
Um, so that's kind of, you know, within, you know,

852
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:22,170
my remote workplace, that's, that's how I suppose I lead.

853
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,150
Um, I encourage them all to find,

854
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,050
you know, a balanced lifestyle as well.

855
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:31,409
You know, it's really important if you're happy at home,

856
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,489
you tend to be happy and productive at work.

857
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,230
Um, so balance for me is important and finding,

858
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,789
you know,

859
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:43,570
and that balance through your relationships and through your own learning

860
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,670
and through performance and career and, and through, you know,

861
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,230
giving back as well, like contributing, um,

862
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,750
I think is, is, is really important.

863
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,949
And so that's,

864
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,869
you know, I mentor athletes as well.

865
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,150
So I, in a way, you know,

866
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,989
I'm leading them or guiding,

867
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:05,389
guiding them through their own journeys and, um,

868
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,489
and teaching and,

869
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:10,289
and passing on and contributing in that way,

870
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,289
passing on things that I've learned,

871
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:14,849
which I believe is a lot about myself,

872
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,869
but also about the process of being successful.

873
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,869
So I really enjoy, um,

874
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,869
guiding athletes and giving them that kind of information.

875
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,389
Um, or, or helping them flesh through their own,

876
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,809
um, their own story, you know, not just story,

877
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,150
but process and,

878
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,150
and what makes a difference to their training and their,

879
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,289
their performance on a,

880
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:39,570
on a daily basis,

881
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,090
um, and help them find things outside of their sport that they're interested

882
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,809
in so that they can be a wholesome athlete,

883
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,489
you know, and a well balanced athlete.

884
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:49,630
So I really,

885
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,289
yeah, I think leadership for me,

886
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:54,210
um, you know,

887
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,329
my dad was,

888
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:55,590
you know,

889
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,349
ran his own,

890
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:56,710
he was,

891
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:57,070
you know,

892
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,590
an entrepreneur in his own right.

893
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,829
So he ran his own business.

894
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:02,510
And so that was instilled from a young age for me.

895
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,250
I never really envisioned myself working for anybody.

896
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:08,570
I've always thought I'll just be like dad,

897
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,929
you know,

898
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:11,070
run my own show and have school holidays,

899
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:12,630
have a lifestyle.

900
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,190
And,

901
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:16,369
and in certain respects that has definitely,

902
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,030
you know,

903
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:17,929
flowed through to me.

904
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:18,110
And,

905
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:19,590
um,

906
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,650
and our kids,

907
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:20,909
you know,

908
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,070
we're seeing it now leading,

909
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,989
leading our children through life,

910
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:24,190
you know,

911
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,989
they see mom and dad working from home.

912
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:26,710
Um,

913
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,409
they always have,

914
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:29,869
they've never gone to a nine to five job.

915
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:30,409
So they've no,

916
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:31,909
they don't know anything different.

917
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,429
So they might want to go to an office to work,

918
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:36,150
but who knows?

919
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,949
They might want to do what we do as well.

920
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,849
So I think you just,

921
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,369
yeah,

922
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:42,210
I think ultimately,

923
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,070
um,

924
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:46,170
if you can figure out how you want to live your own life and find that

925
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,530
balance that we all strive,

926
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:48,469
um,

927
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:49,369
you know,

928
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,289
start with leading,

929
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,690
leading your own life.

930
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:52,349
Um,

931
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,190
but it's important to empower,

932
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,070
our team as well,

933
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:57,269
even as an athlete,

934
00:46:57,269 --> 00:46:57,590
you know,

935
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,650
I was still leading that team of physio and coach and management and

936
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,070
telling them what I wanted to do and how,

937
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,530
and then we all did the little jobs to get there.

938
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:07,829
No,

939
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,650
I can't replace the physio and I can't replace the mental trainer and I

940
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,269
can't play replace the coach,

941
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:14,150
but you can empower them.

942
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:15,190
Brilliant answer.

943
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,449
And,

944
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:15,750
uh,

945
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,429
sums up what we see,

946
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:17,789
you know,

947
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:19,530
people in this type of,

948
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,070
uh,

949
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,110
environment lead in such a profound way.

950
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,889
And your language is,

951
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:23,329
uh,

952
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:23,670
you know,

953
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,489
really aligned with,

954
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:24,750
uh,

955
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,369
a lot of the people we're talking to about empowering other people,

956
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,070
empowering leaders is the title of this podcast.

957
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,829
And you can see you do it in a profound way and body ice that you

958
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:33,130
create,

959
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,909
you had lots of ice on your body on a long way to turn that into a,

960
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:36,989
into a business.

961
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:37,570
As you said,

962
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,530
that's given you a lifestyle and flexibility,

963
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,230
you know,

964
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,730
is another great part of,

965
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:42,610
of your story.

966
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:43,650
We see,

967
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,090
uh,

968
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,869
next dimension we're going to talk to you about is really conscious

969
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,449
leaders and how they positively impact others in their environment.

970
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,090
I really think about that.

971
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:51,690
I mean,

972
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,570
you work from home,

973
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,050
as you said,

974
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:53,210
you,

975
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:53,650
you gravitate,

976
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,110
gravitated to solo sports,

977
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,030
but how have you gone about positively impacting others?

978
00:47:58,369 --> 00:47:59,130
I think the,

979
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,550
it's really important to give back in any way you can.

980
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:03,210
Um,

981
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:04,690
whether that's for me,

982
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:05,230
it's,

983
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:05,889
um,

984
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:06,670
through our business,

985
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,010
you know,

986
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,289
we,

987
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:08,469
we definitely,

988
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:09,590
and you know,

989
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,269
with time over time,

990
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:15,389
I've become completely environmentally conscious and,

991
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,329
and sometimes climate anxious.

992
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:20,150
And so I want to do everything I can to be able to,

993
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:20,929
um,

994
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,349
to help there and,

995
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:22,909
and,

996
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:23,250
and,

997
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,030
and,

998
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,309
um,

999
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,869
contribute.

1000
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:25,230
So,

1001
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:25,489
you know,

1002
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,210
both of my businesses zone and,

1003
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,349
and body ISA,

1004
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:29,010
you know,

1005
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:29,190
we,

1006
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,750
we,

1007
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,329
um,

1008
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:34,570
contribute to 1% of the planet and try and do our bit and sourcing

1009
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:37,889
better solutions environmentally of our products.

1010
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:38,349
So,

1011
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,670
and so that,

1012
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,809
that is a pretty big part for me.

1013
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:44,730
We often then donate proceeds to other,

1014
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:45,429
um,

1015
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,070
climate action charities and,

1016
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:47,429
and,

1017
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,230
and groups.

1018
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:48,809
Um,

1019
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,590
so creating products with purpose,

1020
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,210
but very conscious of,

1021
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,809
of what we're making and whether there's a place for them in this world,

1022
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,469
and they're helping let alone destroying,

1023
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,170
you know,

1024
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:00,570
and not,

1025
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,010
not,

1026
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,710
not completely destroying the world.

1027
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,349
So,

1028
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:04,269
so that's,

1029
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:06,110
that's kind of really,

1030
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:06,889
um,

1031
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:08,690
important for me.

1032
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:08,929
And,

1033
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:11,110
and even though it's small business,

1034
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,510
it's,

1035
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,969
I like to think there is some positive impact,

1036
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:14,349
you know,

1037
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:15,170
for,

1038
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:15,530
for,

1039
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,130
for,

1040
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,530
for what we do in that way.

1041
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,150
Um,

1042
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,809
not let alone helping people recover from the injuries,

1043
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,590
but in a conscious way.

1044
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,030
Um,

1045
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,510
and then,

1046
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,190
yeah.

1047
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,289
So the giving back side of things is,

1048
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:28,849
I think,

1049
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:30,050
um,

1050
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,449
super important because that's,

1051
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:33,289
that's a cornerstone really like positive.

1052
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:37,730
How do you have positive impact is by leading in a professional way and being

1053
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,530
able to empower those around you,

1054
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:44,389
but also giving time and giving space and energy to others so that they can

1055
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,010
flourish.

1056
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:45,889
Um,

1057
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:47,630
for me teaching,

1058
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:48,090
you know,

1059
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,610
other people how to,

1060
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:50,929
um,

1061
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:51,769
how to,

1062
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:52,210
how,

1063
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,110
how to have a,

1064
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,789
not how to have a positive impact,

1065
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:00,909
but how to change the state from being a little bit flat and negative to lifting it up to

1066
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:03,769
being turning around to be positive and motivating.

1067
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:08,730
Because if you can change someone's state from being a little bit flat and unmotivated

1068
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:13,130
to motivated and charging like you're doing a bit.

1069
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,730
So I do that,

1070
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,809
whether it's in my business or one on one with athletes,

1071
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:17,349
um,

1072
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:19,809
and to the broader community that's,

1073
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,110
that's having really positive impact,

1074
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:22,570
you know?

1075
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,210
So I don't know if that's answered your question.

1076
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,829
It did beautifully.

1077
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:27,070
Uh,

1078
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:27,510
again,

1079
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,170
I love the way you think about that.

1080
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:29,710
Uh,

1081
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,010
you know,

1082
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,949
creating and sharing a vision is something we see really common trait.

1083
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,750
Your vision to change a sport that you didn't really know about until you're 16 is,

1084
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,710
is incredible story in itself.

1085
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:39,929
I mean,

1086
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:43,949
how did you go about and how have you gone in all your other areas when you've got a vision?

1087
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,670
How have you gone about creating it and sharing it?

1088
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,030
Yeah.

1089
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,610
As an athlete,

1090
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,650
so important and it was something that was really strong.

1091
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:51,670
Um,

1092
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,369
it's a good question.

1093
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:55,789
Because it's actually something that I even,

1094
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:56,150
you know,

1095
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,269
today struggle with a little bit outside of sport.

1096
00:50:59,269 --> 00:50:59,750
Um,

1097
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,250
and,

1098
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,369
and I think I play so much importance,

1099
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,210
I suppose on,

1100
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,250
on being an athlete in sport and,

1101
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,409
and having these really strong goals of,

1102
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:09,710
you know,

1103
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,769
winning Olympics and being a groundbreaker for so many years.

1104
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,929
And that vision was often very clear,

1105
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,650
you know,

1106
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:21,050
as an athlete and I did the work and I put all the pieces together to get there.

1107
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,250
And the process,

1108
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,690
the process is the same in business,

1109
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,650
having that same vision and passion for your business,

1110
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,210
I think.

1111
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,449
And then how,

1112
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:29,710
you know,

1113
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:33,730
putting the people in the places and the roles and responsibilities in order to get there.

1114
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,090
So I'm,

1115
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:41,329
I think I'm really good at breaking down vision into like little bite-sized pieces and creating that pathway and plan on how to get there.

1116
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,550
So I try to do that in,

1117
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,489
in business.

1118
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:46,969
And sometimes I,

1119
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,429
I'm not as disciplined to be quite frank.

1120
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:50,010
Um,

1121
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:50,989
you know,

1122
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:51,329
it's,

1123
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:51,730
it's,

1124
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:52,130
you know,

1125
00:51:52,130 --> 00:52:02,389
maybe I don't put as much importance on it because when you're an athlete and you have a time and a deadline and a date to be successful and are used by date as well,

1126
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,550
there's so much intensity and pressure and time pressure to,

1127
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,210
to put all your eggs in,

1128
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,530
into that one basket.

1129
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:10,570
Um,

1130
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,550
and so the vision is intense,

1131
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,670
but so is the process.

1132
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:15,929
Whereas in business,

1133
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:16,889
I slack off a bit,

1134
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,409
probably.

1135
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,610
I don't,

1136
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,030
I wouldn't,

1137
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,070
I'm not lazy,

1138
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,670
but it's not as like,

1139
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,969
it's just business and I'm not driven by money.

1140
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:26,050
You know what I mean?

1141
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,489
So,

1142
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,489
um,

1143
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:28,730
I like,

1144
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,809
love my businesses and I like that they have purpose and,

1145
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,349
and I am passionate about them,

1146
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:39,130
but I don't think I'm as passionate about them in the way I was as an athlete.

1147
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,969
If that makes sense to you.

1148
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:42,309
Makes sense.

1149
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:42,650
And,

1150
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,210
and I can't imagine lazy and,

1151
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:44,630
uh,

1152
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,690
you being mentioned in the same sentence ever.

1153
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:47,630
So I,

1154
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,150
I think that might be an overreach,

1155
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:49,710
but I get it.

1156
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,010
I mean,

1157
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:50,250
the,

1158
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,449
the,

1159
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:52,090
the lifelong pursuit of wanting,

1160
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:56,670
an Olympic gold medal and do that requires a level of focus that,

1161
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,190
you know,

1162
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,130
very hard to replicate,

1163
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,690
isn't it?

1164
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,369
In anything that you do outside of that,

1165
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,369
I suspect it's,

1166
00:53:02,469 --> 00:53:02,670
uh,

1167
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,989
not having done it,

1168
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:04,230
but,

1169
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,650
um,

1170
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:04,949
for me,

1171
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:05,269
for you,

1172
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,650
for me,

1173
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,170
it has been,

1174
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,250
it's just not as,

1175
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,090
um,

1176
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:09,530
yeah,

1177
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,570
I think in business as well,

1178
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,789
like there's a bit of smoke and mirrors,

1179
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:14,170
like,

1180
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,449
you know,

1181
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:18,190
there's people that say they can do a role and they don't deliver or,

1182
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:18,949
or,

1183
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:19,429
you know,

1184
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:21,670
it's not all what it,

1185
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:22,110
like,

1186
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,090
it's everything not is not as it often seems,

1187
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,949
whereas as an athlete,

1188
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:27,469
you can't hide behind anything,

1189
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:28,170
you know,

1190
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,670
if you don't put the effort and the work in and have that perfect preparation

1191
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,150
and even then still things can go wrong,

1192
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,389
but there's no,

1193
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:36,070
the,

1194
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:36,469
the,

1195
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:38,289
and you get the feedback in the sport,

1196
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:38,989
you know,

1197
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:39,610
directly,

1198
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:40,170
directly,

1199
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,610
and often that takes time in the other parts of your life.

1200
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:45,130
We see,

1201
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:45,670
uh,

1202
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,510
people who are leaders and,

1203
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,150
and pave new ground like you,

1204
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,329
Lydia,

1205
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,969
are really curious and curiosity is a common word.

1206
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:52,789
And through curiosity,

1207
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:55,809
they really continue to approach their learning and development.

1208
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,190
Does curiosity play a part in how you think about things?

1209
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,429
Oh,

1210
00:53:58,449 --> 00:53:58,909
absolutely.

1211
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,489
And,

1212
00:53:59,530 --> 00:53:59,929
you know,

1213
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:00,909
serial entrepreneur,

1214
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:01,530
if I don't,

1215
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:01,750
I,

1216
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:02,170
you know,

1217
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,230
love to explore new ideas and,

1218
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:05,710
and,

1219
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,150
um,

1220
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,170
then I lose focus on others and,

1221
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:08,630
you know,

1222
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,130
I'm wanting,

1223
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:09,530
yeah,

1224
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,550
I'm curious about a lot of things.

1225
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:12,070
Um,

1226
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,010
and,

1227
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:14,230
and I think that's,

1228
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:14,489
you know,

1229
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:14,769
how,

1230
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:15,510
I mean,

1231
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,190
I wear a lot of different hats and I think that's how I tame that curiosity

1232
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,329
by doing lots of different things,

1233
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:21,869
whether it's,

1234
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:21,949
you know,

1235
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:26,769
property development or running a business or mentoring or coaching kids or

1236
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,269
whatever it might be.

1237
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:28,809
Um,

1238
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:31,090
having lots of little things,

1239
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,489
you know,

1240
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:33,969
kind of taming that curiosity,

1241
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:34,730
but even still,

1242
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,329
like I'm,

1243
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,909
I love yoga and I'm probably moving more into that passion and,

1244
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:39,170
um,

1245
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:39,530
you know,

1246
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,969
studying kind of Eastern philosophies.

1247
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:42,010
And,

1248
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,050
you know,

1249
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,969
if I had time,

1250
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,489
I'd just send me to an ashram for three months.

1251
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:46,690
Like,

1252
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,349
just let me go because that's,

1253
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:48,969
I'm curious,

1254
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:49,570
you know,

1255
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:49,769
and,

1256
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:50,789
and I know that,

1257
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:51,869
um,

1258
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:56,349
yoga for me has really helped me in so many ways and can help a lot of

1259
00:54:56,349 --> 00:54:57,590
people as well,

1260
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,469
manage their stress and exciting body.

1261
00:54:59,710 --> 00:54:59,769
And,

1262
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:04,210
and so I know that the gift that it's kind of given me and longevity gave me

1263
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,309
through sport as well.

1264
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,070
Um,

1265
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:08,510
so I'm curious about that path that,

1266
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,230
that I want to,

1267
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:10,409
I want to explore it.

1268
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:10,949
So I started,

1269
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:11,449
you know,

1270
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:11,789
I've,

1271
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:12,349
you know,

1272
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:14,429
become a qualified yoga teacher,

1273
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,210
but you know,

1274
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,050
basic one,

1275
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,869
but I really want to expand that and,

1276
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:20,489
and go deeper,

1277
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,170
you know,

1278
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:21,849
into that,

1279
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:22,449
I think.

1280
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,309
And same,

1281
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,090
it's just the same with lots of things like,

1282
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:25,469
you know,

1283
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:25,949
surfing.

1284
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,369
I'm like,

1285
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:27,030
Oh gosh,

1286
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:27,429
I just,

1287
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:28,010
you know,

1288
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,150
I really want to learn.

1289
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,530
I want to learn how to be a better surfer.

1290
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:31,789
And,

1291
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,409
and,

1292
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:33,090
and,

1293
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:33,550
um,

1294
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:34,190
you know,

1295
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:34,670
yeah,

1296
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,230
it's just the same in every probably aspect,

1297
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:37,630
I suppose,

1298
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:43,230
like here living in Lapland and I've discovered a thrill for ski touring.

1299
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,750
And so now I want to learn and do an avalanche course because I want to be

1300
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,909
safe and be confident,

1301
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:48,670
you know,

1302
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,369
in my skillset to go off and do this ski touring.

1303
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:51,650
And,

1304
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:52,650
um,

1305
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,750
and it's the same,

1306
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:54,170
you know,

1307
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:54,989
with business or,

1308
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,510
you know,

1309
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:59,969
I've had so many digital marketers in my business over the last probably five

1310
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:02,110
or six years that I've had a gutful of them.

1311
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,469
So at the moment I'm building out my own ads.

1312
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,849
I'm learning how to do it because I'm frustrated that people haven't

1313
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:09,090
delivered.

1314
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,110
This is what I mean in business isn't always,

1315
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:12,750
you know,

1316
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:13,969
black and white and pure.

1317
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:14,789
Like it is sport.

1318
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:17,829
People kind of fudge the lines and say they can do things and not,

1319
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:18,969
not be able to do them.

1320
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,349
So I get frustrated and want to learn.

1321
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,869
And so I do.

1322
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:24,650
Yeah.

1323
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:26,530
But that spreads you thin a little bit.

1324
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,090
I love it.

1325
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:28,369
I mean,

1326
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:28,949
I love that answer.

1327
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:33,409
You went off into eight different directions and I'm sure another hour.

1328
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,590
I love that curiosity.

1329
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,630
But I'm curious.

1330
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:37,789
You are.

1331
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,050
There's no doubt about that.

1332
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,429
It's,

1333
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:40,030
it's brilliant.

1334
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:41,269
And,

1335
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:42,829
and you communicate with clarity,

1336
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:44,650
which is the next dimension we talk about a lot,

1337
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:44,929
really,

1338
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:45,530
you know,

1339
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,530
systematic leaders about how they communicate.

1340
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:47,929
Um,

1341
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:49,949
you've had to do that in business and in,

1342
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,030
in your sporting life.

1343
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:51,190
And,

1344
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:51,889
and every area.

1345
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:52,750
How have you thought about that?

1346
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,429
Oh,

1347
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,610
I think it's,

1348
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,469
you know,

1349
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:57,230
being able to wind down a day,

1350
00:56:57,369 --> 00:56:57,969
um,

1351
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,150
with three questions.

1352
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,849
I generally give me so much clarity for the next day.

1353
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:05,150
And that is what did we do well today?

1354
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:07,889
What didn't go so well?

1355
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,349
And what are we going to do tomorrow?

1356
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:12,670
And if you can answer those three questions,

1357
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,730
you're moving forward.

1358
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:14,230
You know,

1359
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:17,449
you're kind of with your team,

1360
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,070
um,

1361
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,550
individually,

1362
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:19,929
it doesn't really matter,

1363
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:21,289
but I think it's,

1364
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,750
it's just a nice way to unpack a day,

1365
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:24,409
um,

1366
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,969
and keep the momentum moving forward rather than dwelling on what hasn't gone

1367
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:30,030
well in the past or,

1368
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,230
or whatever that may be.

1369
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,630
And then,

1370
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:33,989
you know,

1371
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,730
next day,

1372
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:37,050
what to expect and what you're going to be working on and,

1373
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,989
and keeping that relatively simple.

1374
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,110
It sounds really simple,

1375
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:40,889
but it helps me.

1376
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:42,130
It's brilliant.

1377
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:42,710
I love it.

1378
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:43,610
Celebrating first,

1379
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,250
what you did well,

1380
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:48,090
and then a bit of reflection and then celebrate first.

1381
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,409
It's,

1382
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:48,889
it's a,

1383
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,289
I love the simplest,

1384
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:50,969
uh,

1385
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:51,909
things are often the,

1386
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:52,130
the,

1387
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,610
the best.

1388
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,889
It's,

1389
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:53,289
um,

1390
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:53,769
you know,

1391
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:55,510
something that everyone can relate to that.

1392
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,269
It's brilliant.

1393
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,070
We see collaboration as a really,

1394
00:57:59,070 --> 00:57:59,750
um,

1395
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:01,949
sought after trait for leaders now.

1396
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,190
They're really conscious about how they collaborate,

1397
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:05,710
who they collaborate with.

1398
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,110
Uh,

1399
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,150
what does that mean to you collaborating?

1400
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:09,230
Um,

1401
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:12,510
I think at the moment it's,

1402
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:12,809
you know,

1403
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:14,650
really in line with,

1404
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,530
in business,

1405
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:15,929
um,

1406
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,190
in working out ways,

1407
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:18,130
obviously to,

1408
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:19,510
um,

1409
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,000
and,

1410
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,199
and,

1411
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:22,219
and,

1412
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:22,260
and,

1413
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:22,679
and choosing.

1414
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:23,500
Um,

1415
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,900
I think I was pretty open to collaboration at first,

1416
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,400
but then realizing that not all collaborations go very well,

1417
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:29,659
but,

1418
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:29,920
and,

1419
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,559
and really picking and choosing who,

1420
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:34,340
who we align with and collaborate with.

1421
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,559
And that's both businesses,

1422
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:36,420
body ice and,

1423
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,199
and zone,

1424
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,440
but,

1425
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,420
but also individually in,

1426
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,519
in partnerships,

1427
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,159
you know,

1428
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:41,400
that,

1429
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,980
that I like to support.

1430
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:43,960
I think,

1431
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:44,400
um,

1432
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,219
you collaborate with like-minded or aligned businesses or people,

1433
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:50,900
you know,

1434
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,260
that are going to put in,

1435
00:58:52,260 --> 00:59:03,000
that are going to put in as much effort in that collaboration for you to get to the next kind of phase of your business or the next stage or have a successful campaign or have a successful launch or whatever that is,

1436
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:03,539
um,

1437
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,099
in that sense.

1438
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:05,940
Um,

1439
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,599
but also in idea sharing.

1440
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,420
And I think that's,

1441
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,440
that's kind of really important where,

1442
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,679
you know,

1443
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,360
especially for,

1444
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,820
for me and my remote team,

1445
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,460
sometimes we get a bit slack in,

1446
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,760
but we try to do on a,

1447
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,099
you know,

1448
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,199
at least a fortnightly basis is to just check in with each other.

1449
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,360
And an idea share and brainstorm and,

1450
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,860
and make sure that we have all the ideas on the table before we make some decisions,

1451
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,199
um,

1452
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,960
about which way,

1453
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:32,280
you know,

1454
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,099
the business is going,

1455
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,400
which way the campaign's going,

1456
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
which way the launch is going,

1457
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:36,519
whatever it might be.

1458
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:36,820
So,

1459
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,000
so yeah,

1460
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,019
collaboration is about idea sharing,

1461
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:41,679
you know,

1462
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,400
and eliminating,

1463
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,039
you know,

1464
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:45,420
those kind of maybe nice to have ideas,

1465
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,119
but what ideas are actually going to move the needle?

1466
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:52,119
What the ideas are actually going to increase engagement or increase,

1467
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:53,460
be sales or increase,

1468
00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:53,920
you know,

1469
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:56,900
our follower base or whatever it might be that we're,

1470
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,179
you know,

1471
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:57,960
discussing,

1472
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:58,880
um,

1473
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,039
at the time.

1474
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:00,380
But,

1475
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:00,760
um,

1476
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,619
yeah,

1477
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:05,300
so it's collaborating is,

1478
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:11,880
is designed to bring idea together so that you can then collectively be better.

1479
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:12,960
Isn't it?

1480
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:13,760
So it's,

1481
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,900
it's,

1482
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,159
um,

1483
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:16,079
pretty good,

1484
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,059
pretty good description.

1485
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:17,460
Yeah.

1486
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,719
And that's a good place to start and end,

1487
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,039
isn't it?

1488
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:21,320
With it,

1489
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,019
not all collaborations,

1490
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:22,679
it's successful,

1491
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,860
but yeah,

1492
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,340
if you're,

1493
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:24,579
um,

1494
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,099
as you said,

1495
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,159
bringing together the sum of all parts to get a better outcome,

1496
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,019
worthwhile thing to pursue.

1497
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:30,699
Listening too.

1498
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,039
Um,

1499
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:32,019
we see great outcomes.

1500
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:33,900
Making sure that you are listening,

1501
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:35,420
taking in and giving,

1502
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,619
listening and sharing.

1503
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:37,599
Lydia,

1504
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:38,900
you've been asking these two questions,

1505
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,380
uh,

1506
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,380
to everyone I've sat down with,

1507
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,019
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1508
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:43,940
Hmm.

1509
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,260
It's tricky.

1510
01:00:48,829 --> 01:00:49,230
Hmm.

1511
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,719
I don't know if I've had,

1512
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,139
I have an answer for that one.

1513
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:55,719
I'm really,

1514
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:56,079
really sorry,

1515
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:56,960
but,

1516
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:57,340
um,

1517
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:58,760
me,

1518
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:02,460
um,

1519
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,159
does that sound stupid?

1520
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,260
But I,

1521
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,420
I've had people,

1522
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:06,900
you know,

1523
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,719
that have been great,

1524
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:08,539
you know,

1525
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,199
to give me advice and,

1526
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:10,619
um,

1527
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:11,800
um,

1528
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,039
to call on and to lean on,

1529
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,199
um,

1530
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:16,400
you know,

1531
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,800
and across many different industries.

1532
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:19,860
Um,

1533
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:25,579
but ultimately they've given me the information that I've needed to make

1534
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:27,340
decisions for myself or for,

1535
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,360
for business or for the direction that I wanted to go.

1536
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:30,940
Um,

1537
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,000
so I don't,

1538
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:34,079
I don't know if that's,

1539
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:34,679
it's brilliant,

1540
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,000
Lydia.

1541
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:35,840
I love it.

1542
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,820
Probably not the standard answer that you wanted,

1543
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,139
but I can't put it on one person because there's been so many people that have

1544
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:44,000
inspired me.

1545
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:45,079
Um,

1546
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,820
whether they're young or old,

1547
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,820
one of my biggest inspirations is a,

1548
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:52,739
is a dear chap called Jeffrey Henke,

1549
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,820
who is,

1550
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:54,900
uh,

1551
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,320
90,

1552
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,199
probably four at the moment.

1553
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,539
And it's just stepping down as the chairman of the Olympic winter Institute after all

1554
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:03,079
these years and has helped,

1555
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:03,679
you know,

1556
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,800
so many athletes in Australia and,

1557
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,539
and helped me,

1558
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:07,400
you know,

1559
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:07,820
um,

1560
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,840
and help get these,

1561
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,139
you know,

1562
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:11,119
Australian facilities off the ground.

1563
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,219
And with that,

1564
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:12,719
he's,

1565
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,300
you know,

1566
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,000
just dogged determination,

1567
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,820
like a little bull terrier and his relationships.

1568
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,900
He's taught me how to nurture and massage relationships and never give up,

1569
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,199
you know,

1570
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,639
and,

1571
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,260
and at 94 years of,

1572
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,820
of age,

1573
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,320
you know,

1574
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,179
and so he's been instrumental in,

1575
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:29,760
in,

1576
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,320
in a lot of,

1577
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,440
in a lot of ways there,

1578
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,940
but there's been a lot of people,

1579
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,739
um,

1580
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:36,139
that then give me the inspiration to,

1581
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:37,380
to live my life in,

1582
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:37,820
in,

1583
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,519
in maybe take steel parts of them and put it in my life.

1584
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:43,400
I love it.

1585
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,940
That sense of self for you is,

1586
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,440
you know,

1587
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,420
an authentic thing,

1588
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:46,800
isn't it?

1589
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,239
That you,

1590
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:47,659
you,

1591
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,300
you're working with people,

1592
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,440
but the idea that you can do it yourself.

1593
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,099
I love it.

1594
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:52,900
I love that answer.

1595
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,000
It's a,

1596
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,800
it's a fan.

1597
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:54,920
And,

1598
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,280
you know,

1599
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,940
listening and reading and preparing for your story.

1600
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,659
I'm not surprised you said it because it,

1601
01:02:58,659 --> 01:02:58,780
it,

1602
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:03,079
you look back and think you had this very few people have that sense of belief and a

1603
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,440
young age and an idea of what they're going to do and then go about doing it.

1604
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,239
So,

1605
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:08,159
um,

1606
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:08,400
nah,

1607
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,079
it's brilliant.

1608
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:09,639
Um,

1609
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,920
final question in the spirit of collaboration,

1610
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,280
which we,

1611
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,480
we love the idea of collaboration,

1612
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,119
which,

1613
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,039
um,

1614
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,519
may or may not resonate with you,

1615
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,420
but if you could collaborate with anyone on any of your,

1616
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,920
your many passions,

1617
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,619
is there anyone that springs to mind?

1618
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,079
Um,

1619
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:25,380
gosh,

1620
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,500
I've been isolated in Lapland for so long,

1621
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,340
um,

1622
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:29,579
that,

1623
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:30,000
you know,

1624
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,719
I haven't been around a lot of people in a,

1625
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:34,619
in a while.

1626
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,760
Um,

1627
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,829
it's,

1628
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:41,070
it's comes back to,

1629
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:41,550
I mean,

1630
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:42,809
yeah,

1631
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:45,369
there are many projects that there's,

1632
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:49,630
there are many projects that I still are undone for me that I'd like to do.

1633
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:50,210
Um,

1634
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,289
I'd love to,

1635
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:53,030
um,

1636
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,929
collaborate a lot more with,

1637
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:57,650
I mean,

1638
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,309
doing podcasts,

1639
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,070
information sharing and things like that.

1640
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,369
If I had the time,

1641
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:04,230
there are certain individuals that I probably,

1642
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,329
I'm not going to name,

1643
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,710
I'm not going to put them on the spot that I'd love to get together and bounce

1644
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,630
these ideas.

1645
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,650
and,

1646
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:11,050
um,

1647
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,769
and some of them are TV personality.

1648
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:13,630
Some of them are,

1649
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,269
you know,

1650
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:18,969
like high functioning CEOs and just superstars in,

1651
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:19,269
in,

1652
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,849
in what they do in business.

1653
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:21,150
And,

1654
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:21,550
you know,

1655
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:27,110
others are athletes that in a way I'd love to get this cast together and,

1656
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,289
and talk to them.

1657
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:35,010
Talk about how we manage day to day life and collaboration and how we lead and

1658
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:35,489
how,

1659
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:39,769
how everyone else breaks down the process of achieving success in,

1660
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:40,030
in,

1661
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,150
in a public way.

1662
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:41,670
I think,

1663
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:42,750
um,

1664
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:44,670
that would be awesome to do.

1665
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:46,190
I've always wanted to do it,

1666
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,349
but in the same time,

1667
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:50,849
be able to give back through whether that's helping athletes or,

1668
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:51,409
or,

1669
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,030
you know,

1670
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,789
certain charities and things like that.

1671
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:57,050
So collectively getting these people together to inspire,

1672
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:57,789
to bring out storytelling,

1673
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:59,550
because I think stories,

1674
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:01,429
everyone's got an awesome story,

1675
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:02,170
like,

1676
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:03,929
and that's what inspires people.

1677
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:04,489
It's not,

1678
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:04,789
you know,

1679
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:07,070
the end game and what they've actually achieved,

1680
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:07,710
but it's how,

1681
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:08,809
how they got there.

1682
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:11,150
And there's many ways to skin a cat and it's un,

1683
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,329
unfleshing and unpacking those,

1684
01:05:14,269 --> 01:05:16,989
fleshing out those stories is what I love,

1685
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:17,730
um,

1686
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,989
to do and finding out how,

1687
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:20,630
how people,

1688
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,469
other people tick.

1689
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,150
Cause you know,

1690
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:26,010
you can kind of get in your own head and sometimes think your ways is the,

1691
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:27,750
what everyone else kind of thinks,

1692
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:28,289
but it's not,

1693
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:29,309
it's not.

1694
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:30,309
And so,

1695
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:31,309
yeah,

1696
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:32,309
I probably,

1697
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:33,309
it,

1698
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:36,309
it almost looks like a TV or maybe a podcast of bringing these people together

1699
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:37,309
and,

1700
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,309
um,

1701
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,309
and just discovering,

1702
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,309
you know,

1703
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:42,309
what,

1704
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:47,309
how they remain motivated and how they inspire and how they lead and,

1705
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:48,309
and,

1706
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:49,309
um,

1707
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:54,309
how they kind of break down these overwhelming tasks,

1708
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:57,309
seemingly overwhelming tasks into these bite size,

1709
01:05:57,309 --> 01:05:58,309
manageable,

1710
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:59,309
uh,

1711
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:00,309
pieces.

1712
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:01,309
That'd be cool.

1713
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:03,309
It's a great segue Lydia,

1714
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:04,309
because,

1715
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:05,309
uh,

1716
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,309
I may have exactly the thing for you because this podcast,

1717
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:08,309
to be honest,

1718
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:12,309
has been based on a business we started seven years ago called Aleda,

1719
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:13,309
A-L-E-D-A.

1720
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:14,309
And we,

1721
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,309
we,

1722
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:18,309
one of the signature things we do is actually bring together exactly like what

1723
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,309
you were talking about,

1724
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,309
Lydia,

1725
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,309
someone like you with your background with someone from the commercial world

1726
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:25,309
or someone from the arts and that idea that different thinking,

1727
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:27,309
and that some of that thinking in these collaborative leadership podcasts,

1728
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:28,309
and now that world,

1729
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:30,309
I can be talking to you in Lapland today.

1730
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:31,309
And,

1731
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:32,309
uh,

1732
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:33,309
you know,

1733
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:34,309
you can have that conversation,

1734
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:35,309
as we said,

1735
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:36,309
you know,

1736
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:37,309
when you're back home in Lawn.

1737
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:38,309
And so the world has shrunk post the,

1738
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:39,309
uh,

1739
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:42,309
COVID and we now understand that that's the possibility is there.

1740
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:43,309
And so we've been really fortunate.

1741
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:44,309
You know,

1742
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:45,309
we see in some of our groups,

1743
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:46,309
we've got,

1744
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:47,309
you know,

1745
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:48,309
uh,

1746
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:49,309
as high profile as Mikel Arteta,

1747
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:52,309
the coach of Arsenal collaborating with Matt Lafleur,

1748
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,309
the coach of the Green Bay Packers,

1749
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,309
or,

1750
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:55,309
you know,

1751
01:06:55,309 --> 01:06:56,309
someone running a small business that wants to learn from,

1752
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:59,309
an athlete in a different sport or someone at college in,

1753
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:00,309
in,

1754
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:01,309
in America who's connecting.

1755
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,309
So the idea of bringing to people to get exactly,

1756
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:04,309
as you said,

1757
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:05,309
for that sharing,

1758
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:06,309
contributing back into the,

1759
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:09,309
into the world of what makes people tick and also learning from different

1760
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:10,309
people,

1761
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:11,309
as you said,

1762
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:12,309
doesn't really matter your background.

1763
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:15,309
Everyone's got a great story and we feel like there's a real gap for when

1764
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:17,309
people get together and share and,

1765
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,309
and do exactly what you did today,

1766
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:19,309
Lydia.

1767
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:20,309
And I appreciate so many notes.

1768
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:21,309
I've got books to read.

1769
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:23,309
I've got inspirations at the end of the day.

1770
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:24,309
And I love it.

1771
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:25,309
I'm fascinated by,

1772
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:26,309

you know,

1774
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,309
been great to have met you a few times over the years,

1775
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:32,309
but to go back and watch your story and taken by the courage and the bravery

1776
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:33,309
and the sense of self.

1777
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:34,309
And I love,

1778
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:35,309

the,

1783
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,309
the greatest leader starts with ourselves,

1784
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:41,309
isn't it?

1785
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:42,309
And,

1786
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,309
