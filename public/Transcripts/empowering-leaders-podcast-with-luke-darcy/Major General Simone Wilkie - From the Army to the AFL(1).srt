00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,990
This week's guest is Major General Simone Wilkie.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,189
In sitting down with her, you immediately get a sense of her presence,

3
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,410
her leadership and her strength of character.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,070
Having spent 35 years in the Army,

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,769
she was responsible for 1,500 soldiers in the combat zone she worked in.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,589
She is truly a trailblazing female leader.

7
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,289
I get to talk to her about leading in combat,

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,429
how she was awarded the Bronze Star for her work in Iraq,

9
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,990
the interesting and surprising synergy and crossover she talks about

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,890
between her leadership in Army and corporate life.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,509
And you'll hear a lot about her passion for accountability,

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,850
stepping up and acknowledging that the Army itself makes mistakes

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,990
and taking accountability in life in general.

14
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,530
It's always a great privilege for me to learn from incredible leaders

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,189
like Major General Simone Wilkie.

16
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,170
It's the basis for the work that we do in our leadership business, Alita.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,049

20
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:20,219
Major General Simone Wilkie AM spent 35 years serving her country,

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,719
breaking new ground for female leadership within the ranks of the Australian Army,

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,219
including becoming the first female commanding officer

23
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,379
of the Royal Military College, Duntroon,

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,640
and the first female commandant at the Army Recruiting Training Centre at Kapuka.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,099
Her post-military leadership portfolio is extensive.

26
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,519
Professor of Defence Technology at Deakin University,

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,859
Director of the Australian American Leadership,

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,879
Dialogue, AFL Sports Ready, the Beaufort Group,

29
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,439
and she still serves as a Commissioner on the Australian Football League.

30
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,079
Major General Simone Wilkie, it's a great pleasure to spend some time with you today.

31
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Thank you.

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,500
Nice to see you, Luke.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,420
Can I start back in 1983?

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,760
You joined the Australian Army, and at that stage,

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,420
it was the Royal Women Officer Cadet School.

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,700
Men and women didn't train together at that same stage.

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,579
And looking back 35 years later,

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,879
you become the most senior role in the Australian,

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Australian Army.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Could you have even dreamt at the start that you'd end up there?

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,259
Oh, absolutely not.

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,680
I actually joined the Army on a bit of a whim.

43
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,400
Sometimes people ask me, why did you join?

44
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,520
And it was actually more to do with one of my friends who wanted to join,

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,620
and we went down to the recruiting unit,

46
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,120
and she didn't like it because it was too physical.

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,199
And I was at school trying to work out what I wanted to do,

48
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,560
and I was too young to join at the time.

49
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,300
So I went off and did, started a phys ed degree.

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
So for a start, I thought I was going to be a teacher,

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,479
and then I joined the Army a year later,

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,240
and to be honest, I was pretty hopeless as a cadet.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was often in trouble, and after about four months,

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,419
I decided that this is not what I want to do,

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,060
and I'd gone back to my university, and they said,

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,840
oh, you can come back second semester,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,979
and I thought, giddy up, here we go, this will be terrific.

58
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,199
And I didn't bother to tell my parents about that,

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,900
and so the Army rang them up and said, oh, you know,

60
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,860
Simone wants to leave, and my father,

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,979
my father said, and, you know, sorry, they said to him,

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,740
look, we can send her back to Ballarat, or she can stay here,

63
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,539
to which my father said, put that application in the round file,

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,379
she'll like it eventually, which is short for,

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,500
well, we don't want her back.

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,819
So, you know, it wasn't a particularly auspicious start,

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,960
and I didn't particularly like it for the first year or so,

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,960
and then before I knew it, the decades were disappearing,

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,639
and I was finishing up as 35 years later.

70
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:40,919
Yeah, so.

71
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,520
So, it was a pretty interesting journey.

72
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,419
The resilience to get through that, you know, it would have been,

73
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,800
you know, in the Army, it's a pretty brutal environment,

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,259
and the training, and you hear a lot about how tough that was.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,639
Was that part of it at the start?

76
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,180
You thought, this is too much, not for me?

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,800
I think it was more around the discipline aspects,

78
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,460
and because I hadn't really thought through why I wanted to join the Army,

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,039
so that was part of the naivety element.

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,280
But then I realised, you know, it's a bunch of the things

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,900
that I really like.

82
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,539
I mean, you talked about the sports industry,

83
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,379
so you're a part of a team, you're learning about yourself,

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,759
you get to, you know, in those respects,

85
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,240
you get to live in different places and get to know people

86
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,740
and get to lead teams.

87
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,360
So, eventually I saw the light, and my father was quite right.

88
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,699
I was actually better off to be in the Army at the time

89
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,779
than being a teacher, even though I sort of ended up

90
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,779
doing a lot of education and training.

91
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,759
Well, it's an extraordinary leadership story

92
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,720
when you think of the many glass ceilings that you broke through

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,879
in that male-dominated environment of the Army.

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,759
When you look back now, what are the unique leadership skills, Simone,

95
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,420
that have allowed you to achieve what you have?

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,699
Yeah, that's a good question,

97
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,160
because I think leadership's about influencing people

98
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,860
and setting the environment for people to succeed.

99
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,459
Many of those things are the same.

100
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,300
Actually, they're very similar in the AFL and the Army.

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,439
You know, set the direction, set the expectations

102
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,839
and set the environment for people to learn.

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,620
I think the military is a bit like a couple of other industries.

104
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,540
Anywhere where you're taking lives or saving lives,

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,459
it's all about trust and respect and relationships.

106
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,100
So, I think those things are certainly drilled into you

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,759
as part of your leadership and development training.

108
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,819
And the military certainly invests a lot in people and individuals,

109
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,420
making sure you understand where you are as part of that team

110
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,339
and how you can lead.

111
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:39,699
So, as a woman,

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,420
I was reading an article on the weekend

113
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,480
where I can't remember the name of the lady,

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,060
but she was basically saying she really enjoyed the opportunity

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,980
to be the only woman in the room.

116
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,100
So, if you get to be self-confident enough

117
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,779
that you can use that opportunity,

118
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,339
then you should be using it for good.

119
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,100
And clearly, you have.

120
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,180
And I want to come back to your crossover post-military

121
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,259
and into the corporate world and where that synergy lies,

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,420
because I'm sure there is an incredible crossover

123
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,899
and clearly the roles that you're doing now,

124
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,660
provide that.

125
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,819
But we've seen this sort of shift

126
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,040
in what we think is a change in leadership, Simone,

127
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
in the spaces, started a business in leadership.

128
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,579
We work in education and sport and arts and social venture.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,759
And we see leaders now are much more self-reflective,

130
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,939
much more collaborative, self-aware.

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,660
They are really conscious of the impact they have on others

132
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,860
and away a bit from command and control.

133
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,160
Is that possible in military leadership,

134
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,639
given the life and death situation,

135
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,519
or is it all about command and control?

136
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,519
I think that's the perception.

137
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,319
I think that's the perception from outside of the military.

138
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,839
And in fact, sometimes I think people's views

139
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,920
are based on those bad Hollywood B-grade movies.

140
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:54,319
And it's, look, there are times in which it is about command and control,

141
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,839
but most of the time it's not.

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,139
So it is setting that environment

143
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,819
for people to actually understand what we're doing.

144
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,300
So, you know, set the purpose.

145
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,660
If you align everyone to the purpose

146
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,899
and they understand their role in it

147
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,879
and you've empowered them to do things differently,

148
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,779
because much like when the whistle blows on the ground,

149
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,920
you can have whatever wonderful plan you had at the beginning

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
and it changes.

151
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,199
In the military, it's exactly the same as that.

152
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,120
So you've got to have enabled people to do what's required

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,439
and then to be able to pivot,

154
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
depending on what the circumstances are.

155
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,639
So that's why I talk around the fact that they invest a lot of time

156
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,399
teaching people about teamwork and leadership.

157
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,399
And I think one of the things I saw probably change

158
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,980
in the 2000s,

159
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,920
there was a big push on changing people

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,759
from being selfish to selfless.

161
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,839
So in the military, it's a values-based leadership system.

162
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,519
And so you need to make sure that people

163
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,879
who are coming into your organisation

164
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,660
are aligned with your values.

165
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,839
I think over time, there was a widening gap

166
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
between what the military's value system was

167
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
and what people were coming from society.

168
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,879
So how they've been socialised at home,

169
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,800
at school, with their friends,

170
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,480
all of those sort of things.

171
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,540
So you then invest more time in making sure

172
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,120
that they understand this is what's required.

173
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,660
So you live up to our values,

174
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,279
you don't live down to the rules.

175
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,240
And I think if you focus on a rules-based environment,

176
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,500
which sort of hits that command and control view,

177
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,720
you won't be successful in the long run.

178
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:39,179
That's a fascinating insight and conversation, Simone.

179
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,740
The values at the core,

180
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,679
and as you said, I mean,

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,879
society's always evolving and changing.

182
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,519
And I think every generation feels as though

183
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,679
that's happened more rapidly than the one before.

184
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,480
It may or may not be the case.

185
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,059
But I mean, even organisations,

186
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,000
as regimented as the military,

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,460
have to adapt to the generations that are coming through.

188
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,679
Otherwise, you can't be successful.

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,000
So for you, the key is then understanding

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,340
the demographics of people, young people coming in,

191
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,720
and then say, hey, these are the values you need to align.

192
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,799
Is that, and that's the core of success for you in some ways?

193
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,500
Oh, absolutely.

194
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,860
And in fact, if you,

195
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,559
if you just went down to the recruiting station,

196
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,240
it'd be different.

197
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,200
It's a lot different than it was when I went,

198
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,460
you know, way back in the dark ages,

199
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,259
you know, before we had electricity and everything in 1983,

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,860
because people have changed.

201
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,200
And, you know, that sort of ticks on that expectation.

202
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,259
People, what are people's expectations?

203
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,159
How resilient are they?

204
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,399
What do you need to do to provide them that opportunity

205
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,059
to be their best self?

206
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,440
And, you know, much like sport, it's about collective success.

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,860
It's not about individual success.

208
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,279
So making sure that they know where they fit in there.

209
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,879
And I think we probably spend a lot more time

210
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,580
sitting down with people in a more nurturing environment

211
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,259
than probably we had in the 80s.

212
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah, which is in keeping, we think,

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,320
with what's happening in other areas of sport,

214
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,039
a much more nurturing environment in sport

215
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,460
than the dark ages when I started playing as well.

216
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,679
So I wasn't necessarily going to go there,

217
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,440
but my mind is going,

218
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,700
it feels like the Army's had a bad PR run in recent times.

219
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,159
And there's been some high profile cases.

220
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,879
And I'm sure you won't want to comment on individuals

221
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,899
for obvious reasons.

222
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,179
But when you have Victoria Cross winners

223
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,519
and coming back post these, you know,

224
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,960
extended theatres of war,

225
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,139
and now we've got vision and video

226
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,600
and more so than ever in the past

227
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,000
and overlaying, I suppose, a complex environment

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,259
and what we think society's values are

229
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,919
onto those environments.

230
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,980
Is that a challenge for senior leadership

231
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,700
in military as well to say those environments are complex

232
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,240
and what we need to do?

233
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,259
Yeah, I think it's a challenge.

234
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:40,320
I think it's a challenge.

235
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,379
I think it's a challenge.

236
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:40,480
I think it's a challenge.

237
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,679
I think it's a challenge.

238
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,940
What does good leadership look like?

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,360
And do we cross the line sometimes

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,860
and get that wrong in battle as well?

241
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,240
Well, look, we're all in, we all make mistakes.

242
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,179
And I think the sooner you step up and accept

243
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,279
and acknowledge your mistake, the better it is.

244
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,720
And we've seen that in many different organisations.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,259
You know, that sort of bad news only gets worse,

246
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,440
particularly if you hide it in the back cupboard.

247
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,279
What you see playing out in large organisations

248
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,399
like the military is accountability.

249
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,460
And it's public.

250
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,320
It's public accountability.

251
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,139
And we absolutely should be demanding organisations

252
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,559
to step up to the plate when things have gone wrong.

253
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,500
So over the times we've had, you know,

254
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,659
things like the defence abuse response,

255
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,740
there's been any number of poor behaviour, misconduct.

256
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,700
You can put as many rules and policies in place that you like,

257
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,100
but unfortunately people will still do the wrong thing.

258
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,460
A simple analogy would be I'd probably, you know,

259
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,440
bet my coffee here.

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,500
Luke, that you've probably put your speedometer

261
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,279
on more than 100 deliberately knowing that,

262
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,259
oh, maybe I can do 102 or 103.

263
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,480
I'll get there a little bit faster.

264
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,460
Did you see that email that just came through?

265
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,059
You've got a sixth sense.

266
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,080
But that's you knowingly stepping over the rules

267
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
because you think that rule's okay.

268
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,039
But if something really went wrong,

269
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,559
you have to own the fact that that went wrong.

270
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:09,600
Yeah.

271
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,419
So from a strategic leadership position,

272
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,000
sure, everyone looks at the reputational risks

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,039
and all of the different risks that come into that.

274
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,360
And, you know, it does surprise me that many of people

275
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,779
that I know around the country who haven't had a military background

276
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,399
have a different view than I do.

277
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,539
If something happens on a battlefield and it's clearly murder,

278
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,960
that they think that's acceptable and, you know,

279
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,279
that's certainly not the way to do it.

280
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,480
But I think that's the viewpoint or the lens

281
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,700
that I look at those things from.

282
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,279
Coming back to values again and, you know,

283
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,820
we're sitting here at AFL House.

284
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,600
I want to talk to you about being an AFL Commissioner

285
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,860
and the same thing.

286
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,019
Young people make mistakes.

287
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,240
Older people make mistakes.

288
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,740
And what you're saying is the accountability part of it,

289
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,879
getting that next part right is an opportunity for great leadership.

290
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,019
Is that what you're saying?

291
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,639
And no matter what it is, whether in a military sense

292
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
or an AFL player making a mistake.

293
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,440
Absolutely.

294
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,799
So, you know, fess up.

295
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,200
Talk the truth to power.

296
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Have the personal freedom.

297
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,259
The fortitude and the confidence to own it.

298
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,159
I mean, let's face it, we're all crap at some things

299
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,580
and that's part of how you learn.

300
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,820
It's part of how you become more resilient.

301
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,860
Wouldn't it be wonderful, like, you know,

302
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,440
if we could just unzip our skulls, pour in everybody else's lessons,

303
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,159
zip it back up and we'd all, you know, work together marvellously.

304
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,299
But that's not reality.

305
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:37,299
So I think that's why it's important to just own it if you've got it wrong.

306
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,019
And it's hard.

307
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,919
Sometimes it's really hard.

308
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:40,840
Yeah.

309
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,100
We want the advantages and the opportunities without the mistakes sometimes

310
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,240
because that is the painful part.

311
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,500
So sitting across from someone whose life has been in leadership,

312
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,000
what does great leadership look and sound like to you?

313
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,659
Look, I think a good leader is someone who can influence people to do things

314
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:02,360
for the better of others or for the organisation,

315
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,279
regardless of what those circumstances are.

316
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,259
So, you know, if you set the direction,

317
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:11,279
then a good leader will set the course.

318
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,659
What does good look like?

319
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,460
This is how we're going to get there.

320
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,259
Acknowledging that that's not going to be what everybody wants.

321
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,899
I think it was Colin Powell who said, you know,

322
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,759
sometimes during leadership decisions you piss people off.

323
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,919
And that's true because, you know,

324
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
a good leader can make those hard decisions,

325
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,000
adjust when the circumstances change,

326
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,019
has the agility to bring people along with them.

327
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,019
And then, you know,

328
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,139
set the expectations.

329
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,820
So this is what I want from you, Luke.

330
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,679
These are the, let's work together on the priorities.

331
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,019
If you don't have those sort of expectations outlined,

332
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,740
well, what will happen?

333
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,299
You'll end up with problems in dissent

334
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,519
because my expectation of what we're here to do

335
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,600
could be quite different to yours.

336
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,019
So in the absence of that sort of expectations,

337
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,940
I think you can, you know,

338
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,360
there's a bit of a balance probably

339
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,799
between the empowerment and art of delegation.

340
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:07,899
Yeah.

341
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:13,120
And giving people a clear sense of where they're going.

342
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,019
And then the final bit for a leader

343
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,799
is to provide the environment for everyone

344
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,759
to have a good crack at it,

345
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,440
have a fair go and meet the requirements.

346
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,379
Well, it's fascinating to me talking military leadership

347
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,740
because there's thousands of you.

348
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,779
You go back to the Roman army

349
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,799
and this has been fine-tuned, you know,

350
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,279
and thought about probably the oldest form of leadership

351
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,000
in some ways and then refined all the way.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,299
And I think that's something that we've got to go through

353
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,639
to the way we train leaders in the military now,

354
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,279
which again, I want to talk to you about.

355
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,679
I just wanted to pivot a little bit

356
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,940
and ask you the question.

357
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,539
35 years you work in the army serving your country

358
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,320
and effectively your role, Simone,

359
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,320
is to do what the government of the time wishes

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,580
and that is without question.

361
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,039
Can I ask you this question?

362
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,320
If you look back, us in the West,

363
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,899
invading places like Afghanistan and Iraq,

364
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,379
does that on reflection to you

365
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,080
feel like it was a positive outcome?

366
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,000
Was that successful?

367
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,720
Was that a good thing to do?

368
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, I'll just pull you up on the invading part

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,840
because in many cases when Australians go to war

370
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,480
or Australians go to other places

371
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,899
and it's not just war, you know,

372
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,539
we do a lot of humanitarian assistance.

373
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,279
It's because the country there has invited us to do it

374
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,620
or we've gone with the United Nations.

375
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,720
So, you know, the very first time I deployed from Australia

376
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,679
was to go to Cambodia in the early 90s

377
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,779
and that was to help set up the opportunity

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,919
for Cambodians to have an election.

379
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,799
So there's, you know, the reason and how you get there,

380
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,700
absolutely, you know, it's different.

381
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,720
That was on the back of the Pol Pot regime

382
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,120
where millions of Cambodians were murdered

383
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,059
in one of the most horrific human atrocities.

384
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,240
So, yeah, we all, yeah, get that context.

385
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,419
Is Iraq and Afghanistan slightly different, I mean, in your mind?

386
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:00,720
Is that...?

387
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,559
Yeah, well, the reasons for going there were different

388
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,720
and, you know, it's...

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,460
It's awful to see how other countries,

390
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,859
what they've gone through and what their people have gone through

391
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,599
and, you know, you'll find a lot of military people have joined

392
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,859
because they want to help other people.

393
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,160
Yeah.

394
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,140
So you arrive.

395
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,539
And it's also, you know, it goes back to that Hollywood version

396
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:26,940
of being in the military.

397
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,279
People think it's, you know, about taking lives.

398
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,720
It's actually not about that.

399
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,819
There's a small proportion of highly professional, you know,

400
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,700
like the infantry elements and the, I suppose,

401
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,240
you know, the vernacular would be the war components,

402
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,039
but there's a really large part of the military

403
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,480
that's actually not there for that purpose.

404
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,460
So it would be wonderful if we could all play together

405
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,619
in the sandpit nicely, but unfortunately that's not always the case

406
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:58,500
and there's a review right now on what do we want our military

407
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,839
to look like going into the future, what are its roles and purposes

408
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,119
and there's lots and lots of different things that you can do.

409
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,779
You just need to...

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Much like a footy team, make sure which one you're more focused on

411
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,400
at the time and certainly around the world right now,

412
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,539
there's lots of things even in our region where, you know,

413
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,440
we're providing assistance after tsunamis and cyclones

414
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,279
and all sorts of things.

415
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,160
Simone, you've been the key leader, as I mentioned,

416
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,640
in the introduction, you know, to Australian personnel

417
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,859
in combat zones in Afghanistan and, you know,

418
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,000
you awarded the Bronze Star for your work in supporting

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,920
what happened in Iraq.

420
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:37,720
What sort of leader are you?

421
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,819
What's it like in that environment?

422
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:42,259
How do you lead in the danger areas that you've been in?

423
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,519
Well, I'll tell you what, one of the people that I had the honour

424
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,259
and pleasure to work with was General Petraeus in Iraq.

425
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,660
So he was the commanding general and I was his deputy

426
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,480
and one of the things that I learnt and I took away from working

427
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,480
with him was that point I was talking about before on the truth to power

428
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,000
and reinforcing what your priorities are and why you're there

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,599
because the higher...

430
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,740
The higher up you go, in many organisations,

431
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:14,619
people don't deliberately filter the truth or their views.

432
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:18,660
There are some people who have their own set of genders

433
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,799
and through their lens can only see a part of the bigger picture.

434
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,579
So I think they might be providing the right advice.

435
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,880
And so the further up you get, you're getting all different advice.

436
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,759
If it's not accurate and you're making decisions

437
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,480
that affect people's lives, that is critical to make sure

438
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,500
that you're getting out to find out what's going on.

439
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,259
So General Petraeus would regularly go out into the battlefield

440
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,299
and talk to people and try and get those briefings

441
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,519
so that he'd make the best decision on the information that he was provided.

442
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,680
That, to me, is really good leadership in an organisation

443
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,319
which was scores of thousands of people from over 40 different countries.

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,420
So if you can imagine, each country's got a slightly different reason

445
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,099
for being there.

446
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,859
They've got different rules around how their people can work

447
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,259
inside that one organisation.

448
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,960
So being able to bring all of those things together,

449
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,259
that, to me, is really true leadership and he was very good at it.

450
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,079
I think it helped also that he had a – I'm sure he must have had

451
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,460
a photographic memory because he never missed a trick or a detail.

452
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
It's fascinating.

453
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,220
My mind, as you're talking, was going – Brian McNamee,

454
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,400
I had the pleasure of sitting down in this context,

455
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,539
who was the legendary CEO.

456
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,740
He was the CEO of CSL, which grew from a really small government agency

457
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,240
here into one of Australia's great success stories,

458
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,420
40,000, 50,000 people internationally.

459
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,079
And he spoke about really having a clear diary

460
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,059
and he just walked the floor of that organisation

461
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:57,099
and randomly want to talk to people no matter what level they were.

462
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,660
And it's probably a bit of truth-seeking as well to find out

463
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,160
at the coalface what was going on in leadership.

464
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,039
You've transitioned from an incredible success story in leadership.

465
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,599
You worked for Boston Consulting.

466
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,579
You're sitting here at the AFL as an AFL commissioner.

467
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,519
Have you been able to – what's the synergy for you in military leadership

468
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,019
and your work that you're doing in other areas?

469
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,619
If I was to just leverage off that point you were talking about

470
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,819
with walking the floor, I totally agree with that

471
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:25,740
because it is your opportunity to see what the issues are.

472
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,960
So when I first joined the commission, that was one of the things

473
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,359
that I'd like to do pre-COVID was to go and visit the clubs,

474
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,359
find out what the club issues are, look at their training

475
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:37,680
and administration.

476
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:37,700
And I think that's a really good thing.

477
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,599
The administration systems, how can you sit on the board

478
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,279
if you don't understand everything that comes up within the AFL industry?

479
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,940
And I would describe it as a complex ecosystem.

480
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,980
There's lots of different things that go into AFL.

481
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,740
So that's important.

482
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,839
Going to games like I did on the weekend, standing on the sidelines,

483
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,039
talking to people, that's how you get a real feel

484
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,900
for what's happening in the organisation.

485
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,319
That's not to say that you'll understand everything.

486
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,099
It's impossible to understand every single aspect

487
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,519
and that goes back to that important element of delegating

488
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,220
and empowering people to make decisions

489
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,799
because it's what happens when you're not there that matters, isn't it?

490
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,940
I mean, you're talking about leadership.

491
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,599
So if you've provided the opportunity for people to make the right calls,

492
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,420
then you'll be successful.

493
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,200
And there's different models even inside the AFL

494
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,819
on the way that clubs do it.

495
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:39,019
And part of what we've been talking around really is culture

496
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:41,500
and the culture of those organisations.

497
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,500
There's a hell of a lot of similarities between an army unit

498
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,779
and an AFL football club.

499
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,539
In specific detail.

500
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,900
I mean, I think sometimes the emotion of the game

501
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,119
that I grew up loving and playing and we see that all the time

502
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,160
and I've marvelled at the volunteer aspect we get in our industry.

503
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,799
People like you come and donate your time.

504
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,380
With all the experience and you look at boards of AFL clubs,

505
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,819
some of the most respected people on the leash,

506
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,759
but then AFL has this emotional attachment to it and win-loss

507
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,140
and then suddenly, you know,

508
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,299
we perhaps lose our decision-making capability.

509
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,079
You might have seen that, Simone.

510
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,200
You're an Essendon supporter.

511
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:22,900
You grew up in Ballarat.

512
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,400
So they've had some challenges in recent time.

513
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,740
And is that unique to sport, do you think,

514
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,480
that the emotions sometimes override good decision-making?

515
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,839
No, look, it's a sine wave, isn't it?

516
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,079
There's ups and downs.

517
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,220
And many organisations sort of blow up for a period of time

518
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,339
and then come back and, you know,

519
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,579
that then goes to the culture and the identity of the organisation.

520
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:49,619
I think there's a real passion for sport in Australia

521
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,019
and some people nearly even define their week

522
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,559
by how well they've gone.

523
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,359
Probably not quite as bad as New Zealand.

524
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,059
You know, if the All Blacks are winning, the economy's in good shape

525
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,640
and if it's down the other side, it's down the toilet.

526
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,720
Yeah.

527
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,900
I think it's great that people can really relate to their football

528
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,000
and it's that community aspect that is so important.

529
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,640
I saw that after the bushfires in particular.

530
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,759
So, you know, we had lots of people donating money

531
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,359
that the AFL then has used around the clubs that, you know,

532
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,059
have been affected by the bushfires, none more so than down at Kangaroo Island.

533
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,079
And that club sort of right in the middle of the island

534
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,940
totally destroyed that.

535
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,359
It was the hub for that community, for netball and footy

536
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,220
and those are the things that I think help people come along

537
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,819
and want to volunteer and be involved, be part of the club,

538
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,559
be part of something that's bigger than themselves

539
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,759
and you've got to learn to accept the wins and the losses.

540
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,680
Loss is always hard but that's part of life, isn't it?

541
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,460
It's a bit like that resilience aspect we were talking about before.

542
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,420
That's what we love about going back to your community.

543
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
You know, I love, you know, four kids.

544
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,640
You're all involved in sport and footy

545
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,460
and you get to see the community aspect.

546
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,779
When it's done really well and the leadership's great around junior sport

547
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,680
and I know that part of the world, Kangaroo Island, to have that devastated,

548
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:19,180
that is the pulse and, you know, often that's the happy place for people,

549
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,519
you know, with the challenges that I've got in life.

550
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,599
And so, you know, again, it's the importance, isn't it,

551
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,339
of having that great community leadership and seeing that pass down

552
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:29,400
and, you know, even as complex an organisation as the AFL,

553
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,960
it does filter all the way back down to a small club on Kangaroo Island, doesn't it?

554
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
The senior leadership of the community.

555
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,960
You set the tone, really, don't you, for community sport right around the country?

556
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,599
Yeah, and you'll see that we've recently invested a lot more money

557
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,519
and we've now carved out a percentage so that we can continue to ensure

558
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,140
that everyone gets an opportunity to play or be involved.

559
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,220
Without community football, there is no talent pathway.

560
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:59,180
I really like our programs like Auskick.

561
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,140
You know, my godson's six years old and, you know,

562
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,039
we're trying to convince him that Aussie rules is,

563
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,720
you know, the way to go, but happy for him to play any and every sport.

564
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,119
But if I look at the different programs that are available,

565
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,039
it's a terrific system, but it relies a lot on volunteers.

566
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,539
So the AFL's doing a lot of things also to try and make it easier

567
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,660
for people to volunteer and be involved in those clubs.

568
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,680
And if I look back at, you know, even when I've played a bit of football myself

569
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,000
and I went to the Trailblazers,

570
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,779
I went to the Trailblazers event the other day for women

571
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,259
just before the Essendon-Hawthorne game,

572
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,940
to see the women there who set up a league here in Victoria in 1979.

573
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,720
I mean, it wasn't even cool to say as a woman that you played footy.

574
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,039
They're people volunteering their time and effort

575
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,759
to provide an opportunity for someone else to come along and have a go.

576
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,779
And that's fantastic.

577
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,700
And you've been a great champion along with the commission

578
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
of really blazing the path for AFLW

579
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,059
and we're into sports.

580
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,980
Season seven and backing up seasons, you know,

581
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,839
it has really, I think, led the way for Australian sport

582
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,140
and the traction and the horsepower of the AFL industry

583
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,880
is just brilliant to see it behind the women's game.

584
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,660
It must make you feel really proud of that contribution

585
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,700
to see how well it's evolved.

586
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,960
Yeah, look, I think the opportunity that I've had to help there

587
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,019
is based quite a bit on what's happened in my time in the military.

588
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,119
So, you know, good policy for women's good policy for all.

589
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,019
And we started,

590
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,599
you know, adopting that in the army in the 90s, you know,

591
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,039
and we were one of the first organisations to turn around

592
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,140
and say it didn't matter what your sexuality was.

593
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,259
You know, that was big news back in the mid-90s.

594
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,380
So to come into the AFL and to help establish not only the league

595
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,539
but opportunities for women more broadly,

596
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
and I think there's lots of different threads that have come out

597
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,319
from having the women's league, we've now got, you know,

598
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,000
things like the coach.

599
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
We've now got the coach accelerator program.

600
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,160
We now have three female coaches amongst 18 teams.

601
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,359
Those are the sort of programs that I think we need to continue to invest in

602
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,319
so that women have the opportunity to do any role in the AFL.

603
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,660
And that's a bit like what we had in the military when we turned around

604
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,460
and said women can do any operational role.

605
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,980
That was the turning point.

606
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,759
And I think AFLW has really helped to provide a more inclusive organisation.

607
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,779
And one that will respect the fact that women can be coach of the men's team.

608
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,380
Women can be CEO of AFL.

609
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,839
There's all sorts of things.

610
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,819
But over time, you need to put in things like gender action plans,

611
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,319
have a strategy like we put out with the 2030 vision.

612
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,400
So I've really enjoyed being given the opportunity to help steer that ship a bit

613
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,599
and get more women out there involved right from the grassroots level.

614
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,599
And, you know, things like...

615
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,339
The Mainsley Football Club, I'm not sure if you saw that recently.

616
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
That's one of the clubs from where I am in Canberra have just basically turned around

617
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,339
and said they're going to pay the same amount for all their players regardless of their gender.

618
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,519
That's sort of where we're heading towards.

619
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,880
I want to get to some dimensions of leadership.

620
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,019
But reading about you in preparations for this,

621
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:34,660
they tell me that your sense of humour in leadership is a big part of you.

622
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,400
You don't often think of that in the military.

623
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,720
But why is humour so important for you in your leadership?

624
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:45,200
I think, well, you've got to be careful because what I think might be funny,

625
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,579
you might be offended by.

626
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,359
And that's probably part of the way that I was brought up.

627
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,160
And I think it's a good leveller if people can feel more comfortable in their environment.

628
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:02,259
Part of it sort of goes to allowing people to say what they think.

629
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:06,599
You know, I grew up with red hair and, you know,

630
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,519
I think redheads sometimes get a bit misaligned, Luke.

631
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,319
You know, it's a bit hard.

632
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,740
Being a redhead, so you're either sort of, you know,

633
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,640
the Simone Wilkie thesis on that is you're either, you know,

634
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,019
an extrovert or an introvert.

635
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,299
Well, I'm way over left on the extrovert part.

636
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,700
And you know what?

637
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,759
Part of humour is storytelling.

638
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,200
And good leaders can tell stories.

639
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,559
People remember the stuff at the end.

640
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,440
You don't want to sit there and give a huge soliloquy and at the end people going,

641
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,759
well, what were the key points?

642
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,000
You know, sort of turn up, be bold, be good, be gone.

643
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,440
You know, those sort of things.

644
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,079
And I think humour helps in many cases.

645
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,700
Well, I like it when we sat down and I said, you know,

646
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,819
Simone, I asked you some questions.

647
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,700
I don't think there'll be any challenges with it.

648
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,599
And you said to me, I think I can get you from across the table.

649
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,180
I think that was humour.

650
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm not sure.

651
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,019
It was, it certainly put me back in my place pretty quickly.

652
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,240
We, and I say we, passionate about leadership, Simone,

653
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:08,880
in all environments and shapes and size,

654
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,319
we're seeing there are some key patterns.

655
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,640
We think our dimensions of great leadership.

656
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,640
I want to ask you about them.

657
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,500
So please expand.

658
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,599
Starting with self-leadership, that term to us,

659
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,700
we think you can't be a great leader without a sense of self-leadership.

660
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:21,559
Does that resonate with you?

661
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,220
Absolutely.

662
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,000
I think there's four key things you need to know as a leader.

663
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:27,819
And the first one is yourself.

664
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,900
Who you are, how you make decisions,

665
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,299
how you deal with pressure and criticism and all those sort of things

666
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,440
so that you can try to be better.

667
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,839
You know, they always say that,

668
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:43,480
you could say criticism or feedback's a gift.

669
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,079
Well, it is if you learn how to take it properly.

670
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,599
And, you know, some people are not too good at that.

671
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,839
And if you identify that yourself, then you can continue to improve.

672
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,920
So it's a continuous improvement loop.

673
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah.

674
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
You need to know your people.

675
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,500
And that's so linked to knowing yourself.

676
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:06,700
I think the more people understand, I'm a bit fascinated by psychology.

677
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,660
I didn't, I've only done a couple of psychology units,

678
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,480
um, during my time in education,

679
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,720
but much of the army is all about people.

680
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:19,319
And so the more you understand, um, how they react and why they react

681
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:23,519
and that cultural aspects and the values bit and behaviours

682
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,819
that we were talking about before,

683
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,359
the more successful you'll be as a leader.

684
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,740
Um, the third thing you need to know is your job, right?

685
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:36,200
You can't be a professional if you don't know all aspects of your job.

686
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,619
And the fourth bit's, um, you know, it's a bit sun suey.

687
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,640
You were talking about, um, you know, military history before.

688
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,740
You need to know your enemy.

689
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,500
So in an AFL, um, view, that's what team are we going to play?

690
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,380
Where's their best players?

691
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,539
You know, do we need to put like a Crowley tag on this person?

692
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,220
How are we going to deal with this?

693
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,599
How are we going to adapt and whatever?

694
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,839
So the more you know the other people, you know, and of course,

695
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,000
if I say that at home, it's not, the enemy isn't your parents,

696
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,900
but you might think that, you know, as you're growing up,

697
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,119
um, you know, you're going to have to, you know,

698
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,220
you're going to have to, you know, you're going to have to,

699
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,259
you know, you're going to have to, you know, you're going to have to,

700
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:13,000
the more you understand, um, how they do their business,

701
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,980
the better leader you will be.

702
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,039
It's a brilliant, uh, answer and it leads to a lot more thinking.

703
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,140
And I, and that's why I love the, the crossover and, you know,

704
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
sometimes in football, we used to think it's, uh,

705
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,740
almost a little bit, um, naive to, to, to, you know,

706
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,319
think about being in a war zone.

707
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,299
But I think in terms of knowing your people,

708
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,160
it's been a much more sophisticated environment AFL.

709
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,160
You're getting 40 or 50 people from incredibly diverse backgrounds,

710
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,579
and remote indigenous communities, and private schools,

711
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,500
and all sorts of different, um, situations.

712
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,819
I think that has come a long way now in coaching the individual

713
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,900
and the care for the individual as a whole person.

714
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,299
And is that something that you've seen evolve in,

715
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,099
in the other leadership spaces you're in as well?

716
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,099
Absolutely.

717
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,700
Because that's how you make that team.

718
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Yeah.

719
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,579
That's how you get all of those different people

720
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,779
merging together for the same purpose.

721
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,700
Um, and, you know, if I go back to the army,

722
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,380
when I was running recruit training,

723
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,019
and when I was running officer training,

724
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,739
all those people came from every different part of Australia,

725
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,260
just like a football team does.

726
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,820
So if you know that they have all those different experiences and backgrounds,

727
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,860
you have to provide an opportunity for each and every one of them to shine.

728
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,900
And you know that they're all different.

729
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,500
I think one of the areas, you know,

730
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,199
Australian as a nation sort of, um, moving to,

731
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,699
is accepting and celebrating difference.

732
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,119
You know, it sort of goes to the tenets of inclusion,

733
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,260
but we've, we are much better at that, in my view,

734
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,940
than we used to be, where we'd put people in categories

735
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,820
and we'd just leave them in those categories,

736
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,639
rather than helping them to shine and, and, um, become part of that team.

737
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,559
A friend of mine, Scott Gaten, who did his PhD in high performance teams.

738
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,619
And when he, um, the essence of what he came down to,

739
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,079
there were about four or five values that high performance teams have.

740
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,260
And that's things like, um, courage, uh, integrity, persistence,

741
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,179
good judgment, and being a team worker.

742
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,820
Now, that was a review that he did, well, not a review,

743
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,380
that was his PhD, I should say.

744
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,920
It takes a long time to do a doctorate.

745
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:28,579
Um, they were the values that he saw in special forces and, and officer training.

746
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,579
Do they sort of sound familiar to you in a footy team?

747
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:32,900
Absolutely. Yeah.

748
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,739
And they sound familiar, Simone, in high performing environments everywhere to me.

749
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,980
I mean, those traits are really common.

750
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,239
Yeah. I mean, those traits are really common.

751
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,260
And with different applications, and I, I love what you said before,

752
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,059
because I generally believe this, not just inclusion for ticking a box,

753
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,820
but celebrating people for their differences.

754
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,440
Because it feels to me that smart organisations actually understand

755
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,579
that's where the genius is.

756
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,940
If we all look the same and sound the same and went to the same school,

757
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,400
you don't get the creative thinking, you don't get the acceleration, do you?

758
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,940
And the best organisations now are, are so much smarter at understanding

759
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,980
that's where the competitive advantage actually lays, isn't it, in lots of ways?

760
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,840
Oh, absolutely. And of course, it'd be boring if we're all the same.

761
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,539
Um, so, you know, provide that opportunity for people to be different.

762
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:23,599
And if I was to bring it back to our discussion before on AFLW, that was one of the principal

763
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,500
tenets that we did, um, when we were running the, so I chaired the advisory group, and-

764
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,739
Around bringing the competition forward, or, yeah, yeah.

765
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:33,739
Yeah, about establishing-

766
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:34,739
Yeah.

767
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,780
The competition, you know, because let's face it, we had to set it up in a pretty short

768
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
period of time.

769
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,360
There were lots of different factors to put in there.

770
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,539
And one of them was, well, let's celebrate that it's different.

771
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,539
Yeah.

772
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,099
Um, and women are, for a start, physiologically different to men.

773
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,539
Um, if it was that easy, remember Flo Jo?

774
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:57,840
You know, she was on the juice, and she still couldn't beat Carl Lewis, the fastest man

775
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
on earth.

776
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,019
So, let's acknowledge that there are, uh, physiological differences.

777
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:07,639
So, things like, um, the size of the ball is smaller.

778
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,639
Um.

779
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Um, the quarters are shorter.

780
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,820
We have six in a team.

781
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,699
Part of that was for congestion.

782
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,039
Um, there were people who didn't want it to be different.

783
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:24,099
You know, because their view of women's football and its value is rooted in, um, what the men's

784
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,099
game looks like.

785
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,860
It has to be the same as men.

786
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,340
And it actually doesn't.

787
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,539
And let's make sure that we're setting it up for success.

788
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,539
Setting it up to be the best, um, of football.

789
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,539
And, um, you know, I think that, um, I think that there's a lot of, um, there's a lot of,

790
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:44,400
think that was one of the really good fundamental things that we did at the beginning and you can

791
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,699
see it through each year on on whatever themes coming out and that's helped people to um i think

792
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:57,400
grow to love aflw yeah brilliant and you set it up for success and for those of us coming on the

793
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,019
journey and having sisters and daughters now and you look back and think that the possibility that

794
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:07,659
pathway wasn't there is just ridiculous and you know but it does take leadership to set it up

795
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:12,639
right and um you know my mind's still you know casting to 20 years from now and think you know

796
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,800
when eight-year-old girls have a pathway that is is clearly underway you can imagine that we're

797
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,780
going to see something quite uh amazing as time goes you already are season seven of aflw has been

798
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,440
brilliant in a short time we see leaders uh simone very conscious about how they positively

799
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,860
impact others in their environment on a daily basis does that uh dimensional leadership ring

800
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,639
true to you yeah i mean part of that goes to respect

801
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:45,360
and um the trust environment that you've set up ultimately for organizations to be successful i

802
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,940
think it is all about trust and relationships um and sometimes it's also the networks that you

803
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,199
involve and even in the internal politics of how decisions are made and who makes them so

804
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,260
setting that um i suppose it comes back to the point i was making before on

805
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,980
environment that enables people to succeed

806
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:11,500
you've heard you talk a lot about in leadership in this conversation around

807
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:18,039
you know setting the path and having the uh the the vision really clear and if you don't how can

808
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,880
you expect people to come on board with you as you said sometimes quoting colin powell they're

809
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,519
not going to always be happy but creating and sharing your vision is a really key

810
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,940
trait we're seeing consistently how have you gone about doing that in in the environments you're in

811
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,900
um well that that is critical because the vision's

812
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,639
the end of the vision is the end of the vision and i think that's a really important thing to

813
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:43,260
sort of let me put another way you can have a vision but if you don't provide the resources

814
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,679
for that vision or you've actually produced as an illusion so a vision is a great thing to have

815
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:54,420
but you have to make sure that you've enabled people to get there and it has to be an achievable

816
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:02,480
vision that's why i like strategies so you know you set that vision and then you put the key

817
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,139
tenets or the pillars that you need to have for it then you actually need to go away and produce a

818
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:12,639
vision for how you're going to get there and sometimes that's where people don't quite get it

819
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:19,059
right so making sure that you've got the right structures that you've got the right resources

820
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,920
that you've got the right people in those roles and then being able to adapt them i always think

821
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,940
one of the hardest things you can do as a leader is actually to turn around to someone say you're

822
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,059
no longer part of our team and i'd call it i call it swimmers and non-swimmers

823
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:41,920
you get into the pool and there's people who can naturally swim and there's people who haven't

824
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,420
been taught to swim and then you can teach some of those people to swim and then there's people

825
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,539
who's still going to be floundering around in the bottom of the pool what would you do if those

826
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,699
people look well there's not a role for you is there eventually if you're not up to it so get

827
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,039
them out of the pool because it's not good for them and it's not good for everybody else but to

828
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,639
actually sit down with somebody and say we know you really want to be there and this is probably

829
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:12,820
one of the hardest decisions i ever made in the army was a young lady who was in recruit training

830
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:19,579
she so wanted to be there she'd always wanted to be a soldier if everyone was as committed as she was

831
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:25,760
would have been fantastic but she just couldn't do it and all the other girls were helping her

832
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,639
and eventually i had to say look i'm sorry but we're discharging you yeah you know that was

833
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,039
really difficult because that was a person who so wanted to be there

834
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,539
then you'll have some other people in your team who are just naturally gifted and

835
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:49,360
lazy you know and how do you then motivate those people um to give their best so that that sort of

836
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,480
comes back to those elements of you know how do you empower people knowing them how's the best way

837
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,619
to get them to be a good team member and and then the courage and leadership as you said some i'm

838
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,260
andrew bassett uh one of the co-founders of seek his brother paul's on the afl commission with you

839
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:13,739
seeks one of the most successful uh businesses in recruitment and so they have sophistication

840
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,920
around it but he went to that category and said that's specifically the hardest you've got someone

841
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,500
who's a good person who you really love in the organization but you work out they just aren't

842
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,320
up to the he said really that's that's really tough but you're not doing the right thing by

843
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,400
them or the organization if you don't identify that and share it and he said you know the

844
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,199
sometimes easier one is the person who is lazy and not going to do it because you can pretty clearly

845
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,780
make that uh make that call it's interesting to hear your you know personal experience with that

846
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,119
curiosity is a term we hear a lot simone with the leaders that we're working with and through

847
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:51,300
curiosity they are on that constant learning and improvement journey does that ring true with you

848
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,559
as well yeah well i mean if you're not curious and things will pass you by um or you'll miss

849
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,699
indicators so i think it is really an important thing part of that curiosity bits also your

850
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:07,579
analytical skills and your critical thinking skills

851
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:12,619
so you know can you identify patterns can you identify the opportunities going forward

852
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:18,679
can you identify who's not actually pulling um they're part of the bargain anymore and

853
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,639
you know in line with that that part you're talking about how do you respectfully

854
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:28,579
help them to work out there's a better way or respectfully help them find another opportunity

855
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:33,519
if you're not curious you're going to miss a lot of those things you can't sort of

856
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,539
chuck all the ingredients in throw it in the oven sit back and forget think you're going to

857
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:43,480
get a wonderful cake i mean i can't cook i'm looking forward to the days that uh technology

858
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,239
produces robots and i can just just put curtis stone's recipes in there and bingo beautiful meal

859
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:55,219
as you said not everyone can do everything so there's always um growth for all of us uh

860
00:43:55,219 --> 00:44:00,440
communication with clarity i i suspect coming from your background you're really sophisticated

861
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,239
in how you communicate i mean i think of you and your role in iraq working with general petraeus

862
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,639
you've got countries from all over the world you've got countries from all over the world

863
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:12,340
with slightly different objectives i mean how have you gone about communicating with with clarity

864
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:21,260
um i think it's absolutely imperative requirement to be clear if i remember um would have been when

865
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,940
i was a brigadier and i was running training um in the army and i had five people um direct

866
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,619
reports to me and so i gave out simone's vision of what we're going to do and you know a bit of

867
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:37,639
an idea of when i wanted it done by and on one side of the world i was a brigadier and i was a

868
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:44,880
of the room i had got a boss great no problems and on the other side i had a fellow saying to me

869
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,420
no no i need more detail i want to know what you want when you want it by etc so you know like

870
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,880
really detailed approach and so i learned i learned from that which is some people

871
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,559
you really need to just provide an overview of what's what you want and other people you have

872
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,639
to clearly communicate to them exactly what it is that you're doing and i think that's a really

873
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:11,719
you want still providing the opportunity for them to put their own color and movement

874
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:17,380
on it their own shade of whatever they want it to look like um but if you haven't communicated

875
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,300
it properly in that gap people will make stuff up they'll do msu msu makes

876
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:33,099
it was uh um fair enough i mean john worstfold in this same conversation is that the same thing

877
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:37,639
you come out of a team meeting and you say hey you know we're

878
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:41,559
really going to strengthen our defense and and this is a real key tenant of the game plan that

879
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,019
i want to implement and he said you walk out and then you've got the defenders uh again this is

880
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,659
the best and and some of the forwards are going right you know he doesn't care about attacking

881
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:55,980
and and so you realize out of 42 people in a room how you you know nuance that conversation around

882
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,659
you know this is what we think's best for everyone and how we're going to perform together but

883
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:06,800
there's a skill to it isn't there because you can lose people unintentionally just by you know not

884
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,380
getting it right

885
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:12,400
yeah and that comes back to we see and hear things differently depending on how we've been

886
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,260
socialized and how we've been brought up or the environments in which we've lived in in the

887
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,460
military we spend a lot of time um teaching people what we call the rules of engagement

888
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,940
and so you will give orders and it's very clear on some so there's some things that there's no

889
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:36,719
room for interpretation on and then there are other aspects that totally are yeah i had the

890
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:37,599
great pleasure of

891
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:43,400
you know being uh gallipoli on the centenary of ansec the dawn service one of the most uh extraordinary

892
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,000
days i've ever been to see the sun come up over that peninsula famous peninsula of australian

893
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,860
history and you sit in the trenches and you look and you know 10 meters on the other part where

894
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:58,360
the turkish soldiers were literally you know you could long jump it felt like a cross and and you

895
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,139
know to have the whistle blown and you're going to run into that you know with a machine gun across

896
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:06,940
them and that that is is there room in do you look back on military history and that and think

897
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:13,340
you know what what choice did people have back then was that something that's evolved over time he

898
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:18,320
looked at that and just thought that was just tragic to see that up close i mean how much more

899
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,300
sophisticated is it now is there choice in those situations um so i think you're probably talking

900
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:29,139
about the neck were you at gallipoli you know and which you can't imagine until you're actually

901
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:33,400
standing there looking down at um or it's one of the most emotional things you've ever seen

902
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,820
15 16 year olds who are sitting in there literally

903
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:41,500
running into and then there was beauty in it too because you read the history and you think you

904
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:47,960
know eventually they blow a whistle and and both sides come out and you know exchange gifts clear

905
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,900
up the bodies and there was a you know even with the enemy there was a sense of respect and

906
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,559
camaraderie at that that incredible time as well so yeah it was a it was an experience you can't

907
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,059
forget but i i couldn't help but think i'm not sure if you blew the whistle i was going to go

908
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:07,639
i don't know whether you know that's a that's a reflection on me but it's

909
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:11,719
at some point you almost feel like someone had to say that's crazy yeah have you ever watched

910
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,820
blackadder yes so you know in the last series where they blow the whistle and they go over the

911
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:23,059
top and everything before that was you know sort of dark humor around yeah um being there and if

912
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:27,739
you go back to our history in those periods you know it was still queen and country so a lot of

913
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,860
people volunteered without truly understanding what it meant but there was this sense of we're

914
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,639
doing it for the right reasons yeah if you actually go to the other end of the neck and

915
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:44,980
you try and walk up that gully um it's it's even more horrific because the vegetation and and

916
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:50,079
everything that's there so and you've got this sort of tunnel vision towards the top i think one

917
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:58,900
of the um really interesting parts of of that campaign is at a turk and you probably saw what

918
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:07,599
he wrote after you know after that terrible period um of for his nation and he wrote

919
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:13,159
to the australian mothers didn't he and said your your your sons that are here and i'll get i'll

920
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,940
butcher this and get it wrong but we care for them like our own sons effectively or words to that

921
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,860
affair i mean you're not you know the hair stands on the back of your neck doesn't it to think that

922
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:28,719
that was and he you know really wanted to bring you know together understood the tragedy of it

923
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,639
all didn't he and understood the leadership going forward it's an amazing presence and sense of

924
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:37,639
history that he had wasn't it yeah absolutely yeah and he went on to lead his own country

925
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:43,619
and i think it's terrific that lots of australians want to actually go to gallipoli um if you get the

926
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:49,780
opportunity absolutely go there if you don't go to places like the australian war memorial in canberra

927
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,380
because it's not about glorifying war it's actually about those stories and

928
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:59,820
um you know getting back into helping other nations and helping people get through tragedy

929
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:06,119
and crisis and no but i can assure you this like um military people don't want to go to war

930
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,639
that that's the

931
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:14,380
worst case scenario you train for it but you'd much rather the politicians and the big decision

932
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,179
makers don't put people in harm's way and and that you can negotiate without having to go to war

933
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:24,900
the last dimension i want to ask you about was collaboration and maybe segwaying from attiturk

934
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,940
into as you just said you know the last resort is the opposite of collaboration isn't it how

935
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,079
important in leadership do you think collaboration is i think there's a whole policy words that are

936
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,019
really important like you know collaboration

937
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:44,659
celebration cooperation compromise even you know there's a whole swag of those words that sit in

938
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:53,219
there about how you meld people together and if you're not prepared to cooperate um then how are

939
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:59,079
you going to get to an outcome that everyone's or as many people as possible are happy if you're

940
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:04,000
not going to always end up with a solution that everybody's happy with but you know that's why

941
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,500
we talk about win-win some people are only focused on

942
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:15,659
win-loss win at all at all costs but the long-run implications of that you will get festering

943
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:21,460
problems so try and cooperate and collaborate together so that you get the best outcome

944
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:28,159
so final two questions uh simone it's been uh incredible privilege to sit down and and uh spend

945
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:34,159
this time with you and and so much uh to learn i and i have been along the way um but asking these

946
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,019
two questions of all the leaders have had the pleasure of sitting down with who's been the

947
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:37,639
greatest leader in the world and who's been the greatest leader in the world and who's been the

948
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:45,679
greatest leader in your life i haven't actually thought about that before and i wish i'd done my

949
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:55,360
reconnaissance so i knew what you what your questions were um probably marty studdart so he

950
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:03,239
was uh the commanding officer that i went to cambodia with and he was so good at aligning

951
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:09,820
everybody to the purpose and reason that we were there for in difficult circumstances an environment

952
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,000
in which we didn't really know that we were there for and so i'm going to ask you a question

953
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:16,039
that we were going into um and with different people coming into the organization on

954
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:24,099
on regular occurrences um and just a really decent good human being and that came to you

955
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:28,260
as just someone that had that effect i mean you've been around leadership all your life i suppose but

956
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,539
when you're someone in real time does it like that it really stands out for it

957
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:39,940
yeah absolutely it does um and making the hard calls um when people did the wrong thing and then

958
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:45,500
um getting people to appreciate where those boundaries are of what's acceptable and what's

959
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:53,679
not acceptable so that people um can then in their own minds do the right thing much like we're

960
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,960
talking about before you know what's happening when you're not around if you're a good leader

961
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,659
people are still doing the right things a brilliant answer um in the sense of collaboration we we're

962
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:09,400
fascinated by that if you could collaborate with anyone in the world on on anything and there's a

963
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,000
range of different interests that that you've got um and i think that's a really good answer

964
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:15,539
we mentioned some of them you work with boston console and you work here at the uh the afl on the

965
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:20,000
commission and um you know the beauford group and a range of different interests is there anyone that

966
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,460
you looked at so if i could collaborate with someone is there someone that springs to mind

967
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:30,639
no not really um i think working with lots of different people is the spice of life

968
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:36,260
so it comes back to the fact that i'm an extrovert and i like working with lots of individuals

969
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:42,199
lots of different people um so i haven't really sat down and thought maybe it's you

970
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:48,119
well that would be a great pleasure and a great privilege and i love the answer because you know

971
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,559
there's so much diversity in what you do and continue to do and uh you know blazed a path that

972
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:59,380
very few would have thought possible back in 1983 when you signed on it's fascinating to hear that

973
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,460
you know four months in you're nearly out and we wouldn't have uh you know had the incredible story

974
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,300
that uh has unfolded and uh you know again um it's been a great pleasure pleasure and a great

975
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,559
