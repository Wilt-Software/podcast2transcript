00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,990
This week's guest is Major General Simone Wilkie.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,189
In sitting down with her, you immediately get a sense of her presence,

3
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,410
her leadership and her strength of character.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,070
Having spent 35 years in the Army,

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,769
she was responsible for 1,500 soldiers in the combat zone she worked in.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,589
She is truly a trailblazing female leader.

7
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,289
I get to talk to her about leading in combat,

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,429
how she was awarded the Bronze Star for her work in Iraq,

9
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,990
the interesting and surprising synergy and crossover she talks about

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,890
between her leadership in Army and corporate life.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,509
And you'll hear a lot about her passion for accountability,

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,850
stepping up and acknowledging that the Army itself makes mistakes

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,990
and taking accountability in life in general.

14
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,530
It's always a great privilege for me to learn from incredible leaders

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,189
like Major General Simone Wilkie.

16
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,170
It's the basis for the work that we do in our leadership business, Alita.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,049

20
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:20,219
Major General Simone Wilkie AM spent 35 years serving her country,

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,719
breaking new ground for female leadership within the ranks of the Australian Army,

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,219
including becoming the first female commanding officer

23
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,379
of the Royal Military College, Duntroon,

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,640
and the first female commandant at the Army Recruiting Training Centre at Kapuka.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,099
Her post-military leadership portfolio is extensive.

26
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,519
Professor of Defence Technology at Deakin University,

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,859
Director of the Australian American Leadership,

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,879
Dialogue, AFL Sports Ready, the Beaufort Group,

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,439
and she still serves as a Commissioner on the Australian Football League.

30
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,079
Major General Simone Wilkie, it's a great pleasure to spend some time with you today.

31
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Thank you.

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,500
Nice to see you, Luke.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,420
Can I start back in 1983?

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,760
You joined the Australian Army, and at that stage,

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,420
it was the Royal Women Officer Cadet School.

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,700
Men and women didn't train together at that same stage.

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,579
And looking back 35 years later,

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,879
you become the most senior role in the Australian,

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Australian Army.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Could you have even dreamt at the start that you'd end up there?

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,259
Oh, absolutely not.

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,680
I actually joined the Army on a bit of a whim.

43
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,400
Sometimes people ask me, why did you join?

44
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,520
And it was actually more to do with one of my friends who wanted to join,

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,620
and we went down to the recruiting unit,

46
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,120
and she didn't like it because it was too physical.

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,199
And I was at school trying to work out what I wanted to do,

48
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,560
and I was too young to join at the time.

49
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,300
So I went off and did, started a phys ed degree.

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
So for a start, I thought I was going to be a teacher,

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,479
and then I joined the Army a year later,

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,240
and to be honest, I was pretty hopeless as a cadet.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was often in trouble, and after about four months,

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,419
I decided that this is not what I want to do,

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,060
and I'd gone back to my university, and they said,

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,840
oh, you can come back second semester,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,979
and I thought, giddy up, here we go, this will be terrific.

58
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,199
And I didn't bother to tell my parents about that,

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,900
and so the Army rang them up and said, oh, you know,

60
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,860
Simone wants to leave, and my father,

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,979
my father said, and, you know, sorry, they said to him,

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,740
look, we can send her back to Ballarat, or she can stay here,

63
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,539
to which my father said, put that application in the round file,

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,379
she'll like it eventually, which is short for,

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,500
well, we don't want her back.

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,819
So, you know, it wasn't a particularly auspicious start,

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,960
and I didn't particularly like it for the first year or so,

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,960
and then before I knew it, the decades were disappearing,

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,639
and I was finishing up as 35 years later.

70
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:40,919
Yeah, so.

71
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,520
So, it was a pretty interesting journey.

72
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,419
The resilience to get through that, you know, it would have been,

73
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,800
you know, in the Army, it's a pretty brutal environment,

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,259
and the training, and you hear a lot about how tough that was.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,620
Was that part of it at the start?

76
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,180
You thought, this is too much, not for me?

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,800
I think it was more around the discipline aspects,

78
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,460
and because I hadn't really thought through why I wanted to join the Army,

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,039
so that was part of the naivety element.

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,280
But then I realised, you know, it's a bunch of the things

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,900
that I really like.

82
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,520
You talked about the sports industry, so you're a part of a team,

83
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,759
you're learning about yourself, you get to, you know, in those respects,

84
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,240
you get to live in different places and get to know people

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,740
and get to lead teams.

86
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,360
So, eventually I saw the light, and my father was quite right.

87
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,060
I was actually better off to be in the Army at the time than being a teacher,

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,800
even though I sort of ended up doing a lot of education and training.

89
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,720
Well, it's an extraordinary leadership story when you think

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,720
of the many glass ceilings that you broke through,

91
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,879
and that male-dominated environment of the Army.

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,759
When you look back now, what are the unique leadership skills, Simone,

93
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,420
that have allowed you to achieve what you have?

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,699
Yeah, that's a good question, because I think leadership's

95
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,480
about influencing people and setting the environment

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,860
for people to succeed.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,459
Many of those things are the same.

98
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,300
Actually, they're very similar in the AFL and the Army.

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,459
You know, set the direction, set the expectations,

100
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,839
and set the environment for people to learn.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,620
I think the military is a bit like a couple of other industries.

102
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,540
Anywhere where you're taking lives or saving lives,

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,459
it's all about trust and respect and relationships.

104
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,100
So, I think those things are certainly drilled into you

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,759
as part of your leadership and development training.

106
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,800
And the military certainly invests a lot in people and individuals,

107
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,420
making sure you understand where you are as part of that team

108
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,339
and how you can lead.

109
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:39,800
So, as a woman...

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,199
I was reading an article on the weekend where...

111
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,980
I can't remember the name of the lady, but she was basically saying

112
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,980
she really enjoyed the opportunity to be the only woman in the room.

113
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,779
So, if you get to be self-confident enough that you can use that opportunity,

114
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,339
then you should be using it for good.

115
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,100
And clearly, you have.

116
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,180
And I want to come back to your crossover post-military

117
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,259
and into the corporate world and where that synergy lies,

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,500
because I'm sure there is an incredible crossover

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,759
and clearly the roles that you're doing.

120
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,680
Now, provide that.

121
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,040
But we've seen this sort of shift in what we think is a change in leadership, Simone,

122
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
in the spaces, started a business in leadership.

123
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,579
We work in education and sport and arts and social venture.

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,759
And we see leaders now are much more self-reflective,

125
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,939
much more collaborative, self-aware.

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,660
They are really conscious of the impact they have on others

127
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,860
and away a bit from command and control.

128
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,759
Is that possible in military leadership, given the life and death situation,

129
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,519
or is it all about command and control?

130
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,519
I think that's the perception.

131
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,319
It's the perception from outside of the military.

132
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,980
And in fact, sometimes I think people's views are based on those bad Hollywood B-grade movies.

133
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:54,319
And it's, look, there are times in which it is about command and control,

134
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,839
but most of the time it's not.

135
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,819
So it is setting that environment for people to actually understand what we're doing.

136
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,300
So, you know, set the purpose.

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,920
If you align everyone to the purpose and they understand their role in it

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,740
and you've empowered them to do things differently,

139
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,600
because much like when the whistle blows on the ground,

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,899
you can have whatever wonderful plan you had at the beginning and it changes.

141
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,000
In the military, it's exactly the same as that.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,100
So you've got to have enabled people to do what's required

143
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,399
and then to be able to pivot depending on what the circumstances are.

144
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,399
So that's why I talk around the fact that they invest a lot of time

145
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,399
teaching people about teamwork and leadership.

146
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,699
And I think one of the things I saw probably change,

147
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:49,759
in the 2000s, there was a big push on changing people from being selfish to selfless.

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,839
So in the military, it's a values-based leadership system.

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,879
And so you need to make sure that people who are coming into your organisation

150
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,660
are aligned with your values.

151
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,399
I think over time there was a widening gap between what the military's value system was

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
and what people were coming from society.

153
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,959
So how they've been socialised.

154
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:16,000
Socialised at home, at school, with their friends, all of those sort of things.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,500
So you then invest more time in making sure that they understand this is what's required.

156
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,720
So you live up to our values.

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,920
You don't live down to the rules.

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,420
And I think if you focus on a rules-based environment,

159
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,120
which sort of hits that command and control view,

160
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,200
you won't be successful in the long run.

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,879
That's a fascinating insight and conversation, Simone, you know, the values.

162
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,879
That's a fascinating insight and conversation, Simone, you know, the values.

163
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,879
That's a fascinating insight and conversation, Simone, you know, the values.

164
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,879
That's a fascinating insight and conversation, Simone, you know, the values.

165
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,879
And I think that also is at the core.

166
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,940
And, as you said, I mean society's always evolving and changing.

167
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,240
And I think every generation feels as though that's happened more rapidly than the one

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
before.

169
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,720
It may or may not be the case.

170
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,840
But I mean even organisations, as regimented as the military, have to adapt to the generations

171
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
that are coming through.

172
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,899
Otherwise you can't be successful.

173
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,100
So for you the key is then understanding the demographics of people, young people coming

174
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,039
in and then saying hey, these are the values you need to align with.

175
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,799
Is that – and that's the core of success for you in some ways?

176
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,799
Oh, absolutely.

177
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,139
in fact, if you went down to the recruiting station, it'd be different. It's a lot different

178
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,659
than it was when I went, you know, way back in the dark ages, you know, before we had electricity

179
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,360
and everything in 1983, because people have changed and, you know, that sort of ticks on

180
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,580
that expectation. People, what are people's expectations? How resilient are they? What do

181
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:36,639
you need to do to provide them that opportunity to be their best self? And, you know, much like

182
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,600
sport, it's about collective success. It's not about individual success. So making sure that

183
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,820
they know where they fit in there. And I think we probably spend a lot more time sitting down

184
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:56,519
with people in a more nurturing environment than probably we had in the 80s. Yeah, which is in

185
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,039
keeping with what's happening in other areas of sport, a much more nurturing environment of sport

186
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,580
than the dark ages when I started playing as well. So I wasn't necessarily going to go,

187
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,039
but my mind is going, it feels like the army's had a bad PR run in recent times. There's been

188
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,899
some high profile cases, and I'm sure you won't want to comment on individuals for obvious reasons,

189
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,580
but when you've Victoria Cross winners and coming back post these, you know, extended theatres of

190
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,899
war, and now we've got vision and video and more so than ever in the past and overlaying, I suppose,

191
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,419
a complex environment and what we think society's values are onto those environments. Is that a

192
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:36,620
challenge for senior?
