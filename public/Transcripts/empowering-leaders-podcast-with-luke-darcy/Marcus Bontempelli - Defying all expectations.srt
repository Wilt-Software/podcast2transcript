1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:14,849
How do you handle expectation and what can you do to use that expectation as a means to achieve

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:24,070
great success? G'day, it's Luke Darcy. The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,910
off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine. With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,929
collective and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport,

5
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,189
industry and the arts that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

6
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:59,850
where everyone has a voice. In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders. In 2013,

7
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:05,730
Marcus Bontempelli was the number four pick in the AFL draft to a struggling Western Bulldog side.

8
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,450
At just 18 years of age, the Bont was hailed as a future star of the game and a pivotal figure for

9
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,030
the club. Three years later, with all the weight and expectation, Marcus Bontempelli and the Bulldog

10
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:30,060
stunned the AFL world by winning the 2016 premiership. So what did Marcus do along the way

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,099
to exceed those high expectations and what are the tangible actions he's now taking as the captain of

12
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:41,620
the Western Bulldogs to lead the club to further success? Bont, great to catch up with you. Thanks

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,000
for your time. Thanks, Darce. Good to be with you and talking. I hope you can fact check me at any

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,760
stage, mate. I think there's so much to talk about with you, but I wanted to start an old shared

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,680
teammate of ours, Bob.

16
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,280
Murphy described you when you arrived at the Witten Oval, and you may have heard this before as an

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,060
18-year-old, as football's equivalent of Jesus arriving in the West. Now, were you aware that

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,860
you were making such a big impact at such a young age? No, I wasn't. Bob always has a good way with

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,419
words, doesn't he? But that seemed to heap too much pressure on a young bloke at the beginning

20
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:21,699
of his career. But he obviously sensed or had been around long enough to know he'd seen something

21
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,419
different probably in me.

22
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:32,020
Yeah, it was a great time to be probably joining the football club where they're on the up. I was

23
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,020
quite lucky and fortunate to come into, I guess, a club with a rich history, really strong sort of

24
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,259
leaders that really probably gave me the freedom and the lack of expectation from the word go to

25
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:49,939
just explore my football and the curiosity side of things when it comes to trying to establish

26
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,400
yourself as a footballer, but find that confidence at the level.

27
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,259
Yeah, it does go pretty quickly to think that I've just finished my eighth season,

28
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:03,840
but I've been pretty fortunate to be where I am now and have some of the accomplishments that I have.

29
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,879
You seem to be a really natural leader as captain of the Bulldogs. What were you like as a kid,

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,219
Bob? Did you always see yourself in a leadership way?

31
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:18,819
Somewhat, I think. I always strive to probably be in leadership positions, but I reckon that

32
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,620
sort of, not the hunger or the want to be a leader probably changed as I got a little bit

33
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:29,879
older. I probably ended up in leadership positions just more as a result of my sort of actions and

34
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,840
behaviours and appetite to want to get the best out of myself as opposed to focusing on being a

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,500
good leader. It sort of shifted for me probably when I joined maybe the football club or just

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,080
before. I wasn't probably as focused on leadership, more focused on sort of how I was acting and

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,159
behaving and ultimately just sort of trying to be myself. So I had a few little leadership

38
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,699
positions as a teenager growing up. I was a little bit more of a, you know, a little bit more of a

39
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,419
So I've always liked being in that position, but it wasn't something I necessarily, you know,

40
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,319
craved from the word go or then even, you know, once I joined the football club.

41
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,939
Common thread, Bob, when I, you know, researched about you and having had some exposure over the

42
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,560
years that you've always been mature beyond your years. Can you explain that? Where does that come

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,759
from?

44
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:21,079
It's really probably hard to pin down where it started, maybe having, you know, three sisters

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,699
and them sort of wanting me to be a leader.

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,500
Either grow up or, you know, be a certain way. I just, yeah, I just, it's sort of the way I've

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,740
always been. Obviously, you know, your parents and your family have such a big and strong influence

48
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,420
on you as a kid growing up. It's really probably just the way that I was. I sometimes think people

49
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,680
maybe because I'm a bit, you know, more, you know, cruisy and low key by probably nature and

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,620
personality. People take that for mature. I don't carry on like probably some others or have the

51
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,699
same sort of exuberance energy, but it's probably the way I've always been.

52
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,899
It's probably just always the way that I've been is just happy to go wherever, do whatever and

53
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:00,060
just, you know, jump in line almost. Yeah.

54
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,399
Might pick up that thread because I know family is such an enormous part of who you are and,

55
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,240
you know, quite clearly with the three sisters, Alana, Olivia, Sienna and your mum, Geraldine,

56
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,860
your dad, Carlo, they had a huge influence clearly over you. But you particularly, I hear you

57
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,579
reference the girls' influence on your life. You've been an ambassador for a charity called

58
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,939
The Line, which is a national violence prevention campaign that aims to support young people to

59
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,699
understand what respectful relationships are. And I think that's a really important thing.

60
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,000
So can you talk about that influence of the girls in your life and why that's so important to you?

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,639
Yeah. I mean, we were so close as, you know, most families are, but particularly ours and the way

62
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,699
obviously I grew up and I was raised through them and obviously by mum and dad. I just think,

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
you know, you see, you know, older sisters, particularly what they do, how they act and

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,699
how they behave and obviously having a strong connection and influence, particularly in my

65
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,699
family to women. I probably, as I grew up, I grew up with a lot of women and I grew up with a lot of

66
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,639
women and I grew up and matured, felt more and more inclined and more and more, I guess,

67
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,639
empowered to try and support a greater message of, you know, obviously, as you mentioned,

68
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,139
The Line and the violence and just responsible relationships towards women in general. So

69
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:14,160
they're always there for me, always supportive. Obviously, you know, women have this sort of

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,399
caring sort of maternal nature to look after you and in being the only boy, they definitely

71
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,439
fostered that mentality or emphasis with me. And it definitely has, I guess,

72
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,759
rubbed off on me in terms of probably how I try and see things, how I try to treat people.

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,240
And yeah, their influence on me has been pretty significant to definitely who I am today.

74
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,660
So what's it been like, you know, for them watching, you know, you're the second youngest

75
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,079
in the family, but to see your success over the last eight years, I mentioned off the top and,

76
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,279
you know, to become, you know, an out and out superstar of the game and on your way to doing

77
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,379
incredible things you've already achieved so much already. Has it been a change in

78
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,540
the dynamic to have, you know, you with such a public profile now?

79
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,339
Not really, which I think's the really good thing. And really important thing about family is that

80
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,040
you're always family regardless of what you're doing or what you've achieved. And

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,920
in many respects, that's, you know, never that I, you know, ever felt like I was getting too

82
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,540
carried away with, you know, some of the things I'd achieved from an early age, but they were

83
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,100
always there to quickly bring me back down if I ever was carrying on or getting a bit cheeky,

84
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,019
which, you know, that's the...

85
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,720
The awesome thing about, you know, professional sport, which does take a toll on you mentally,

86
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,879
obviously, and physically, that always knowing you've got that, you know, safe space, those safe

87
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,480
people in that environment to be yourself in. And, you know, as I progressed throughout my career,

88
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,439
they've always treated me the same and it's always stayed the same in my family. And then

89
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,740
that environment, I'm still there, you know, younger or older brother, and they still won't

90
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,060
let me get away with anything as it was when I was a kid, I was bossed around most of the time,

91
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:52,980
never got to choose.

92
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,480
What we're watching on the TV and that probably in a way led me to just jumping outside and

93
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,199
kicking the footy. So I do have them to thank for, you know, not giving me an inch when it came to,

94
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,600
you know, who was in charge. And yeah, that probably sent me outside, which they were,

95
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,759
you know, great with as well. They were all, you know, active and sporty as kids and as children

96
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,920
too. And definitely helped me probably, you know, foster my love for the football game. Yeah.

97
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah. I couldn't think of a better ambassador for what, you know, respectful relationships

98
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,139
sound like. And it's a great credit to you. I know,

99
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,600
you support many great causes along those lines. So I hear people say that you've got this great

100
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,460
ability to connect with, you know, teammates and people outside of the footy club, regardless of

101
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,879
what personality type they are. They could be fanatical trainers and you're an extreme professional.

102
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,120
They could be the guys that, you know, get in a bit of trouble and don't mind, you know,

103
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,700
pushing the boundaries. To me, that is the art of great leadership. Is that something that's

104
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,480
again, come naturally to you or have you put some time into being able to connect with all

105
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,639
different types? It definitely has. I think,

106
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,940
you know, from a, from a young age, I always remember, you know, mum sort of describing that

107
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,480
way that, you know, I'd be able to sort of make friends with anyone. And it's probably like that

108
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,860
in the, definitely in the locker room when it comes to football, you've obviously got

109
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,440
a number of different lads from, you know, completely different ages, grown up with

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,139
different backgrounds. And it's just the one thing that's probably always come naturally to me. Like

111
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,960
I enjoy being part of a team that's clearly made up of, you know, different personalities and

112
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
different people.

113
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,480
And it is the one thing that, that definitely, you know, lends itself to, you know, good leadership

114
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,320
is, is that ability to connect. And it's, it's nice that that's probably one of the things that,

115
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,559
that has, you know, come naturally to me to, to, to be able to, you know, connect with young and

116
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,480
old people. And it's probably the thing that I look at, you know, all my friends and in my career

117
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,759
and then, you know, note that from, you know, a young age at 18, I was, you know, probably pretty

118
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,639
good friends with Bob Murphy as much as I was, you know, Jack McCrane and these blokes who are

119
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,659
the exact same age.

120
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,840
And it definitely, I think, helps when you're trying to, you know, bring people together to, to jump

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,179
into a, to a journey and, you know, inspire them and try and entice them to get the best out of

122
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:02,519
themselves.

123
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,179
Part of the evolution of being a captain is that sometimes your role is to hold behaviours to

124
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:12,360
account when people, you know, inevitably have challenges as it goes along. How's that been for

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,620
you having to maybe, you know, hold your teammates to account at times?

126
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,299
Yeah, it's been something that I've, I've grown in. I think something like that probably should,

127
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,899
should take some time.

128
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,320
Naturally, you know, when you, when you come into a football club and, you know, you progress,

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,059
you know, relatively quickly like I was, was able to. I think those, those sort of outside calls of,

130
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,259
of leadership, people are quick to put that label on you. When you're probably, whenever you become

131
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,360
good at something, they like to think that there's another, another level for you to go. And then,

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,240
and as you do, I think, you know, as I did, I looked to the people who were, you know,

133
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,259
the most influential players in our team as, as the most sort of significant,

134
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,860
leaders and all for, for different reasons. But once you do become in, I guess, that leadership

135
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,220
position and people look to, you have to develop that ability to have, I guess, you know,

136
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,899
stern conversations with others as they start to, you know, potentially either make mistakes or,

137
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,460
or start to, you know, venture off onto a path that doesn't quite suit the direction of our

138
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,220
football club. And it's something that I've, I've, I've definitely gotten better at. I wouldn't say

139
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,240
it's a, you know, probably not a huge strength. I don't think it necessarily is something you want

140
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,720
to do too often. You want the, the power of the, the group and the message that you're constantly

141
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,779
giving to continue to bring people back in line. But it's something, you know, it's, it's part of

142
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,679
leadership, but it's something I've, yeah, gotten better at in the short term. Yeah.

143
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,340
I want to ask you about the coach that you've played under now for, for many years, Luke Beveridge,

144
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,840
and you've achieved incredible success together, the 2016 premiership and, and beyond and everything

145
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,620
that you've done. He's a unique leader. We talk a lot on this podcast, Bon, about sort of face a

146
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,059
modern leader.

147
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,919
And to me, that sort of sums him up, self-reflective. He's emotionally intelligent. He's full of care

148
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,740
for those around him, but he's also incredible on strategy. How would you describe your relationship

149
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,059
with him?

150
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah, we've got a really, really close one, a really, really tight one that's been built

151
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,480
probably over time, over, you know, basis of sort of trust, you know, and, and, and the respect that

152
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,279
we have for each other. And obviously there's a lot of, a lot of love there in terms of what you

153
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,960
go through, you know, we probably bond over the, both being in sort of, you know, leadership

154
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,080
positions and being, I guess, figureheads of the, the football club and, and being able to deal with

155
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,659
the, the challenges that you have to face sort of week in, week out. And those questions that you,

156
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,460
you ask yourself. And, and I remember, you know, Martin Flanagan, who spent a lot of time with

157
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,600
probably both of us at different points off the back of the, the 2016 flag and the, and the book

158
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,980
that he wrote. And he described Bevo as someone who he thought had asked himself like the big

159
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,580
questions in life. And I think that's, that's a good way to, to sum him up. He's really, you know,

160
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,919
he's a really loyal,

161
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,559
person. He knows, he knows what he's about and he's asked himself probably those big life

162
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,220
questions, which allows him to be, you know, the person that he is and allows him to, to feel

163
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,120
comfortable, you know, in his own skin, which I think is the part that, you know, I and a lot of

164
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,659
people respect about him is he's sort of unashamedly himself, which I really admire from him. And it's

165
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,200
something that I continue to admire about him. And you're right, he's a left field, left field

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,919
thinker. It's, it's one of the things that allowed him to connect with our group, you know, really

167
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,340
well is because like we spoke about before, we've got a lot of lads who are, you know, different

168
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,299
personalities, different backgrounds and need to be, need to be motivated in different ways. And

169
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:37,879
him coming to the football club in, in 2015, you know, gave us the freedom to, to be ourselves and

170
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,179
then play a certain way, which gives you the confidence to, to roll out on match day and just

171
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:47,120
do your thing. So yeah, we've, yeah, obviously, you know, got closer and closer over the years

172
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,899
and, and he's a mentor of mine. Yeah, for sure. The language to me, I, I, I find fascinating.

173
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,539
And I love it, you know, even the word love, there's a lot of love there is the word that you

174
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,899
used before. And that wouldn't have been something in the era that I was involved in. It was, you

175
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,440
know, and, and probably for, for, for what the times were, it was very much hierarchical and

176
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,379
you wouldn't really ever get that close to a senior coach. And you probably weren't really

177
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,840
asked about what you thought about it. It seems to be a much more collaborative care base, but

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,519
it's pretty feedback driven environment too, isn't it? So how do you manage that? Because it seems,

179
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,779
you know, unique relationships that you've got, but at times, I suppose the hard questions have

180
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,320
to be asked as well. There is this, I think there's an understanding there within elite

181
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,000
sport at the minute that you can't have it all, all one way. It can't all be, you know, can't

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,559
all be rosy. We've still got to work in a, in a workplace and industry that's requires, you know,

183
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,460
critical feed feedback. And, and sometimes that can be the best thing, thing for you. And there's

184
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,879
a lot of trust within, I think the group and the, and the relationship that, you know, your best

185
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,799
interests are at heart.

186
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,960
There's a, there's a team process, there's a team goal that's in place. And I think Bevo's

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,100
thing over the journey has been to try and empower our players as much as, as possible. At the end

188
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,559
of the day, you know, they provide the, provide the, you know, supporting structure and framework

189
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,740
of, of the football club and are there to, to guide us. But you need the, the playing group

190
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,519
to be the ones that drive the standards and drive the program. And, and it's about, you know,

191
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,220
ownership. It's about, like you said, the collective being able to sort of send the right

192
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,799
message and,

193
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,639
and ultimately continue to sort of lean on that trust. And we probably found ourselves

194
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,980
off the back of the 2016 flag, losing a bit of that within the group, probably

195
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,120
external to that is we didn't quite follow up from that year as well as we would have liked.

196
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,159
And that took us a few years to probably understand and mature through. But it seems like we're in a

197
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,940
position now where, you know, we've, we understand sort of what's required and understand that it's

198
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,539
our journey to sort of, you know, try and bring everyone else on.

199
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,960
I want to go back to something you just said earlier before

200
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,620
around,

201
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,019
asking yourself the big life questions, Martin Flanagan describing Luke Beveridge like that.

202
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,100
What do you mean by that? What, what are those questions in your mind?

203
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,379
Yeah, I think it's, it's ultimately what you want to represent, what you stand for and not

204
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:10,100
probably going back on that because it seems, seems easy because it's unpopular, you know,

205
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,940
popular opinion is to think a certain way or do things a certain way. That's the thing,

206
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,500
once again, I've, I've loved and admired about Bevo is his courage to just be himself and say

207
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,740
things. And that's what, what you want from people is to feel comfortable to, to say and be who they

208
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,559
are regardless probably of, of, you know, if it's unpopular or not. And I think that's the thing

209
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:39,299
about Bevo, he's as loyal as, he's in your corner right until, until the end. And he's happy to walk

210
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:44,779
a, you know, a path lonely at times if he believes in it. And that's probably the thing that I think

211
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,679
Martin was reflecting on. He might not have been, he might've been referencing something else,

212
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,679
but that's just definitely how I interpreted what he was saying.

213
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah. It's a, it's a great insight. I was thinking of a conversation I had with

214
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,759
Trent Robinson who's a Sydney Roosters triple premiership coach in the NRL. And

215
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,799
he reminded me a lot of Bevo. I don't know him, but his language was the same. And he spoke about

216
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,339
coaching these guys to be brutal and win, but there was this softness and care and love at

217
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,539
the same time, which as I said, sounds a lot like your reflections on the environment you've created

218
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:20,720
in the last eight years. I wanted to talk to you about a program we've called Alita Connect that I

219
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,819
heard of. And again, credit to you. You and I had a conversation going back 12 months and talked

220
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,140
about this collaborative learning group and you wanted some diversity in terms of the way you

221
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,119
think, which again is, is unique. I really admire the way that you go about trying to learn and you

222
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,359
created a group with Pat Cummings, who's now just been appointed the captain of the Australian

223
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,440
cricket team. And Andy Lee is extraordinary. I've had the great pleasure of interviewing on this

224
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,099
podcast and Rob Sitch as well. Can you tell me about what that's meant to you in the last 12 months?

225
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,880
Yeah. Well, timing is, is everything.

226
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,740
So it just happened to be that we found each other at a similar time where you're exploring

227
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,099
something and I was curious to try and understand more about leadership, about difference, about

228
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:11,460
trying to continue to bring people together and empower them. And I obviously managed to become

229
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,799
part of this amazing group of, I guess, a bunch of people in all different walks of life. And other

230
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,900
than Patty being, I guess, another professional.

231
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,900
The rest of them are elite in their environments and in their industries. And it was just, it's been

232
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,759
such a great, great experience to just hear from them. And that's, that's, I still see myself in,

233
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:37,839
you know, very much the infancy of, I guess, my, my leadership sort of journey, you know,

234
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,039
title or no title. I think I've always just been curious to understand what I don't know. That old

235
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,839
saying, if you don't know what you don't know is, is something that I sort of continue to follow

236
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,880
sort of day to day about, you know, just trying to spend time with people who are, who are different,

237
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,440
and have had different experiences to, to try and learn a thing or two for myself. So it's been

238
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,160
great to hear from, like I said, a bunch of people of different ages at different sort of timelines

239
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,359
of their, their careers and then, you know, in their leadership experiences to, to glean some

240
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,839
things from them and hopefully give some back. Yeah. The idea of the program is initially sort

241
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,339
of eight, one hour, you know, Zooms, given the fact that the world had shut down and to sort of

242
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:21,859
connect, facilitated by my great friend, Matt, who, Matt Waterwitz, who's,

243
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,279
you know, been doing this for, for a significant period of time without giving away private

244
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,819
conversations, because they are, and I certainly don't want to encroach on that. Has there been

245
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,420
sort of specific things that you've added to what you do out of those conversations?

246
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,559
Definitely, definitely has. The emphasis was to try and come away with, you know, this, this,

247
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,519
I guess not product, but, but try and put together some, you know, hacks, I guess,

248
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,619
when it comes to leadership, that's what it was, how it was sort of deemed and termed is,

249
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,720
is, you know, we'd begin with a, you know, a question about leadership,

250
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,660
or a challenge, or, you know, a circumstance, and try and help each other with some, you know,

251
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,180
some hacks that you could use, you know, essentially leadership hacks or life hacks to,

252
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,259
to help yourself, you know, process that the challenges that come with leadership.

253
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,259
And a lot of them had to do, and the other ones that I probably most took from it was, was, you

254
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,259
know, your, your time management, particularly being able to, you know, obviously, you know,

255
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,920
with the long-term view of being able to maintain, you know, the balance of, of, you know, I was very,

256
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm very, you know, football,

257
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,099
football focused and, and performance focused. So I put a lot of time and energy into how I can

258
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:32,380
best prepare myself and, and perform, you know, come game day, because I've always felt like

259
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,900
that's my best attribute from a leadership perspective is how I'm able to perform and

260
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,299
do what I do sort of day in, day out, but definitely week in, week out. And that's

261
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,380
probably how I've, I've come to be in the position that I am. So I probably at the beginning of my

262
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,819
probably leadership journey, when I talk about, you know, the captaincy stuff got the balance

263
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,200
a bit wrong. I,

264
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,640
sort of felt like I needed to probably give more to the team, start to change a few things and

265
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,279
play, play a certain way, probably in the vein of, of what, you know, some of the, the great

266
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,440
leaders, you know, football leaders I've seen before me and the things that they, they've done

267
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,420
probably more on field and tried to probably be someone who gave more time to others and probably

268
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:16,000
took a bit less out of my own sort of performance and preparation focus. And just trying to get

269
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,779
that balance back in, into, into the correct sort of shape was important for me.

270
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,259
And the other things are that you can't sort of be everything to everyone. It's something I've

271
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,079
struggled with initially as a footballer is trying to sort of please, please everyone and then be

272
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,440
someone, you know, definitely people can rely on, but as long as it doesn't come at the expense of

273
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,759
your own sort of energy and, and the boys are really good at sort of helping me sort of work

274
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,940
through, you know, different ways and different things you can do to, to sort of prevent yourself

275
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,279
from sort of cooking yourself too much so that you can still get out there come the weekend and be,

276
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,039
you know, the, the energetic, influential player that you want to be.

277
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah.

278
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Great insight into, as you said, is, you know, all high profile people in that group and, and,

279
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,339
and you especially living in Melbourne, this crazy football town that's obsessed with

280
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:05,460
AFL, particularly someone that's achieved what, what you've achieved. Have you found you've been

281
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,819
able to just get better balance away from footy, but still keep your performance preparation at the,

282
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,880
at the level you want it to be?

283
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, without a doubt. And I sort of, I feel like that process is an important one to,

284
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,640
to go through as a leader, um, working out, you know, what,

285
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,660
what can work, what, what might not, um, and sort of, you know, what you can get the most bang for

286
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:33,660
buck out of. Um, and you know, the, the boys were really good at, you know, the, the, the space is a

287
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,220
very private space where you feel like you've got, you know, five, five lads who are in a similar

288
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,720
position facing very similar challenges. And you can be quite open and honest about that. Um, and

289
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,059
some of your potential insecurities or the things that you're not coping with as well. Um, and

290
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,740
without a doubt, there was someone within that group who'd been through a similar process or a

291
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,420
similar challenge and can shed some light on how they managed to navigate their way through it.

292
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,180
Um, and it's that, you know, leadership and probably sport, you know, life in general,

293
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,319
it's not necessarily a linear process that just continues to trek upwards. You do find yourself

294
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,759
dipping and, and, and eventually ending up hopefully where you want to be, but it does

295
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,339
have a little, you know, up and down in it every now and again. And, and just trying to navigate

296
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:17,819
your way through that was certainly a lot easier with, with being able to reflect on some of those

297
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:21,740
challenges with these blokes. Yeah. We love that. I had self-reflective learning and that

298
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,440
collaborative learning you're talking about. It was to have, uh, you know, Pat Cummings through

299
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,640
that period of time, break new ground, really very rare for a fast bowler to become the captain of

300
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,079
the Australian cricket team. So that would have been fascinating to see that unfold for, for him.

301
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,019
And clearly he's, uh, he's got incredible leadership qualities as well. Yeah. Well,

302
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:44,119
having only seen, you know, what Pat was about from, you know, externally, like everyone else

303
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,700
up until probably 12 months ago, always had a, you know, a huge amount of respect how he,

304
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,700
how he performed, how he went about his business.

305
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,940
Um, presents really, really well. Um, and then getting an insight for, you know,

306
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,579
you know, more of a insightful, you know, view on, on, on who he is, who he is and how he,

307
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,819
and I felt myself probably, it's probably was easier in a way because we were talking the

308
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:11,019
same language at times when it comes to sport, um, professional, professional sport, um, and,

309
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,019
and the same sort of thing, trying to find that the same balance, you know, in, in still performing

310
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,839
the best way you possibly can, but then also trying to continue to, you know, navigate and,

311
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,559
and provide others the same level of, you know, empowerment to, to, to find their best and,

312
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:30,299
and be at their best. So we were able to sort of thrash a few things out that we'd sort of had

313
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:35,599
similar experiences with. Um, but it's, it's makes complete, you know, sense to me. And it

314
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,579
seems like a really good fit, you know, for, for him to be, you know, the skipper of the cricket

315
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:44,460
team now. Outside of footy, you've completed a bachelor of business, I understand. And you've

316
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,819
got a range of different interests. We've spoken about property interests before, but now an author.

317
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:53,480
A kid's author. Congratulations. Little bomb and the, and the big secret. Tell me about

318
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,920
where that came from. Um, just through a question, the publisher, um, had, uh, you know, basically

319
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,839
rang up and asked whether it would be something, you know, I'd be interested in, in, in doing with

320
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:11,000
them. And, um, uh, like I always do, I do tend to take a little bit of time to, to process and,

321
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,920
and make sure, um, the fit's right. And I've probably got the right story. I don't really

322
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,660
like to do things just for the sake of it. It's one of the thing that, that, um,

323
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:23,720
probably Andy Lee, um, you know, managed one of the hacks was like, if you don't feel like it's a

324
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,259
hell yes, then, then maybe it's not for you. Like you should feel anything you're going to say and

325
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,059
do, you want to feel like you're sort of all in with it. Um, and I really liked that from, from

326
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:37,660
Andy. Um, and so that was the book. I initially was like, yep, I think it's, I think it's a good

327
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,640
one for me, but do take some time to process. And then it was ultimately then about the story for

328
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,140
me. If the story is something that, that really meant a lot to me, then I was definitely in. Um,

329
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:54,539
this, my, my story in life is about family. So it felt like the right, um, the right fit was to

330
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:58,799
sort of run through how, I guess, a little bit of a snapshot of how my family was like growing up.

331
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:03,579
And then obviously my nan, my Nana Nancy is a, is a key, you know, character in the book. And we

332
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:08,460
were really close with, with Nana, um, from a, from a very young age. And, and she, you know,

333
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,380
just fostered one of those really nice, warm, um, comforting environments as a kid growing up.

334
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,559
Um, and I just thought she passed away a few years ago. It'd be great to, um, put together something

335
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:23,140
you know, a physical reminder or memory of, of what she was like for us as a family. And,

336
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,799
and it really just went from there. Yeah. Congratulations. It's, uh, you know,

337
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,779
I'm sure and inspire many of that generation with, uh, your values and everything you stand for.

338
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:36,099
It just comes through and everything, everything you say, but we've been identifying these range

339
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:41,019
of different, uh, dimensions of what we think, uh, modern leaders like yourself, uh, identify

340
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:45,039
with. And so I'm going to ask you a handful of questions and love you to expand as much as,

341
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,099
as you like, or as little as you like. But the first dimension we're seeing

342
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:48,799
is that I'm going to ask you a handful of questions and love you to expand as much as, as you like,

343
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,839
your idea of self-leadership. Um, when I asked you about self-leadership, what does that mean to

344
00:26:52,839 --> 00:27:06,359
you? Um, it's a self-leadership. It's the way you probably, um, try to, I guess, identify how you

345
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:15,119
want to act and act and behave and what you're probably doing to, um, you know, create, create

346
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,200
relationships, create, um, pathways probably for yourself and then, and then for others.

347
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,119
Um, to, you know, following I've always like self-leadership is probably, you know, what I

348
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:32,920
consider probably actions and actions and behaviors. And, and, um, Bevo, you know, puts up this quote

349
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,859
quite often for us is, you know, the whole group, not just our leaders, we've moved away from a more

350
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,480
formal leadership group. Um, but, but, you know, leadership's an act, it's sort of less a title,

351
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,720
but more of a string of actions and behaviors. And it's something that, that I really identify

352
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,180
with, um, as a leader is that I feel like I'm a leader. And I feel like I'm a leader. And I feel

353
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,660
like I'm a leader because of those things, not because someone else sees me as, you know, having

354
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,279
the, you know, leadership qualities. It's really what people see in you, what you're able to do

355
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,619
consistently. Um, so, you know, self-leadership is probably how you, you know, how you hold,

356
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,180
handle yourself. And I think leadership's the, you know, the outcome.

357
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:11,619
I've seen a lot of, um, you just clear values that you stand for when they come out and everything

358
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,480
you say, is that something formally that you, you've written down and you, this is who I am,

359
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,180
or is it just, you, you reflect, as you said, take your time and know what works for you,

360
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,720
what doesn't? Yeah, I'll probably, you know, in the past have, you know, through, um, probably

361
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,339
early parts of, of, you know, my career in football, um, that you do, um, probably go

362
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:34,759
through that process of, of, you know, starting with a big sheet of values, then probably

363
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,099
circling what the key ones are for you. And, and I definitely know what they are, but I wouldn't

364
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:46,960
have needed a big list to choose from. I sort of, um, I feel like my family values, um, you know,

365
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,180
obviously hard work, humility, um, and then,

366
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,519
and outside of that, I feel like your application just sets, sets the rest of light to, to whatever

367
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,359
you're doing. So, um, I think, you know, once again, we're such a, we're a product of our sort

368
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,319
of environment and the people that we spend most time around. So I'm just, I guess, a reflection

369
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,039
of, of my family and the people that I've grown up sort of around and then managed to sort of

370
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:21,799
attach myself to in the, in my younger years. When we're seeing leaders, um, you know,

371
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,519
like yourself really conscious of how that positively impact others in their environment.

372
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,140
And before we started this conversation, I was talking to you, you spent your off season and

373
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,339
you've, uh, uh, carted along, that may be not the right term to use, but, uh, Jamara

374
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,859
Ugelhagen was, you know, a teammate of yours, number one draft pick and wanted to try and

375
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:42,519
follow you effectively in the off season to learn your professional behaviors. It's a,

376
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,220
it's a great commitment in your break time to, to do that. I mean, it's a great example of

377
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,579
how you positively impact others. There are other thoughts about how you do that?

378
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,660
Um, yeah, definitely. I think, um, as you, as you get older,

379
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:01,779
um, and through your career, um, and feel like you get a better feel and a better, um,

380
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,980
a better consistency with, with, you know, or confidence in your performance and your training

381
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,359
and feel like, um, you can continue to add sort of add layers and add little things,

382
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,180
but you start to realize, you know, what, um, how you want your, probably your influence or

383
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,519
things to not last, but leave, I guess, a legacy in a way. And, and your best way to do that is,

384
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,500
is through others and through, you know, those definitely younger than you,

385
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,039
that, um, are about to go on a similar pathway and similar journey to you. And, um, once again,

386
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,480
I was sort of reflecting on, you know, my own experiences with, you know, Bob Murphy,

387
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,920
Matthew Boyd, Dale Morris, um, you know, Easton Wood, who's just recently retired and their impact

388
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,859
on me from a very young age and how, how influential it can be if you're just willing to sort of take

389
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,880
the time to, to spend that with, with young people. So Jamar is an example of, of obviously a young

390
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
player, um, who comes in with, you know, a lot of, you know, a lot of, you know, a lot of, you know,

391
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,559
who comes in with, you know, a heap of attention, a heap of focus, which I had to a certain degree,

392
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,880
but definitely not at the same, same level. And we're even living in a, in a pretty different

393
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,480
sort of world nowadays to what we were sort of eight years ago when it comes to, you know,

394
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,539
phones and social media and the, how much it probably follows you more than it did even when

395
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:19,519
I came in. Um, so that, that was, you know, really Jamar is sort of doing and his appetite

396
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,220
and desire to, uh, you know, probably start this pre-season off maybe a bit better than, you know,

397
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,900
than he did the last one and basically set himself up to, to have a, you know, an improved

398
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,619
season. And, and, um, I was really just happened to be around at the time and he was keen to stay

399
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:40,079
in and, um, you know, stay on and stay away with me and just start training together. So, um, it's,

400
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,140
it's really good maturity for him from one year to the next to be able to go, um, you know, I want

401
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,559
to, I want to make more of this season. Um, and he's applied himself, um, really well. So excited

402
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,220
to see what, what sort of happens there for him. But ultimately I just love the idea,

403
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,359
of, of that being able to help others through their challenges and, and try to, you know, be a,

404
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,980
you know, a bit of a, an all-star in a way for him to, to try and follow and reflect with.

405
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,339
Yeah. It takes great leadership to, to give that commitment in your, in your downtime

406
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:12,380
as well. We talk about creating and sharing a vision and, and footy clubs generally have a

407
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,400
pretty clear vision about what they want to achieve. How have you gone about that influencing

408
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,099
and sharing and creating a vision within the group you work with?

409
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,880
Yeah, that's probably been, you know, the one thing, um, that I've had to sort of develop and

410
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,839
get more confidence in, um, because, uh, from my own perspective, I always found it quite easily

411
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,339
to, you know, be motivated to, to set goals and then, and then try to, you know, achieve them and

412
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:41,200
put all the things in, in place. Um, but it's sort of, it becomes a different, different challenge

413
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,319
when you're trying to inspire, once again, like we spoke before, a group of, you know, in our case,

414
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:51,319
40, 44 odd, you know, different, you know, ages, demographics, different personalities to try and

415
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,180
find, you know, something that connects with them. So, um, I guess I spend a fair bit of time,

416
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:00,539
you know, listening and, and, and watching and, and reading things that I feel like could be

417
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,779
quite useful and then different, you know, motivational pieces. And, um, it's always

418
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,740
about feel for us at the, at the Bulldogs. It's something, you know, just probably with Bevo,

419
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,519
with Bob Murphy, um, and with probably a number of our players that, um, it's got a feel right

420
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,039
for us. It's a process I go through with Lisa Stevens, who's, you know, a friend of mine,

421
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,039
sports psychologist, and she's been, been at the football club for, you know, a year or two,

422
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,519
I reckon longer than I have. Um, and we've both got a pretty good sense of, of what the group,

423
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,839
you know, feels connected to. Um, it's not just words on a wall that it has to, you know,

424
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:40,779
has to land right with our group and has to feel right. So it's, it's a process more than anything.

425
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,700
It's not just, oh, that's a great quote that can drive us. It's more, um, do we feel like this is

426
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,759
the right story for us? And can we, can we breathe life into it? Um, cause ultimately if the group

427
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,480
doesn't connect with it, it's virtually useless. Um, so that's, that's a process I like going

428
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,680
through, but it is quite difficult, but something that I know Bevo does incredibly well, but I could

429
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,579
imagine wouldn't be easy as he, you know, researches in the off season, what our themes and

430
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:10,519
what our, um, what our visions are going to be for the year, sort of year on year. It's something I,

431
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,820
once again, other things I really admire about him. I love hearing, uh, the language, you know,

432
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,420
Lisa Stevens is, I know it's had a huge impact, uh, to say a great friend and also the club

433
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,739
psychologist. It's such a,

434
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,699
different era that, you know, in the past it was not really even available or accepted. In fact,

435
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,820
people probably, uh, felt ashamed if they, you know, if something was going on, your marriage

436
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,099
is going to break down. It's clearly a different culture that you've created. Now I've heard you

437
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,900
use the word curiosity several times when we've been chatting already today and we see great

438
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,500
leaders really have curiosity and they approach their learning and development through the idea

439
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,480
of curiosity. Can, can you expand on that? Yeah, it's, um, I think it's something that

440
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,019
nowadays is a pretty common trait in, you know, especially the people that are best,

441
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,260
the best in what they do, um, sort of ever curious about what else is out there. And,

442
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,079
um, you know, Bevo was another one who sort of led the way with the, back in sort of 15,

443
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,599
16, the why not sort of ask that curious mindset of, of us as a, as a team exploring,

444
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,340
you know, something better than we were and, and, and that, um, we shouldn't count ourselves out.

445
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:20,000
Um, and another, you know, another major influence in my football and my career has been, been Joel

446
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,380
Corey who started the football club at the exact same time as I did, obviously Geelong sort of

447
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,500
champion and, and triple, you know, premiership player, um, but a really, really quiet sort of

448
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,559
reserved personality. And, and, um, I was probably a bit the same when I first sort of started out.

449
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,099
So he managed to really connect on, on that level, but he was someone that continued to sort

450
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:45,380
of ask, ask me questions rather than, I guess, tell me the things that he probably knew, you

451
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,400
know, the answers to and how I could get there. The idea of asking the questions is because you

452
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,980
need to experience it.

453
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,659
You need to experience the process, process yourself. And that's something I probably have

454
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:59,400
just, you know, continued to do, um, ever since sort of my, you know, early, early days at the

455
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,780
football club was continue to ask questions about, you know, certain things, even from a club

456
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,900
perspective or club direction perspective, continue to maintain that curious mindset and understand

457
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,659
why I guess the, the things are happening the way that they are. And it's definitely something that

458
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:18,500
I continue to do with my football and, and, and skill development is continue to be curious about,

459
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,599
you know, what else there is.

460
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,420
Out there that I can try and master or how I can, um, you know, make things more difficult or more

461
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,840
challenging.

462
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,019
And as a captain of an AFL club, you're in the communication business a lot more than, uh,

463
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,099
perhaps you would have been a few years ago that the times and the, uh, demands for you to,

464
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,940
to represent the club and be the face of the club. We, we, we identify, um, leaders talking

465
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,440
about their communicating with, with clarity regularly. Is that something you've put some

466
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,619
time into how you communicate?

467
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,199
Yeah, for sure. I think it's an important thought whenever you're, you know, addressing the group,

468
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,980
um, you know,

469
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,579
even I guess addressing, addressing the public, it's something that maybe he's come sort of

470
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:00,300
naturally when it comes to sort of communication and hopefully, hopefully being clear. Um, but

471
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,980
ultimately wanting to, to be really confident about the message that you're sending. And, um,

472
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:09,159
I, once again, I've got a process that I go through when I speak to probably, you know,

473
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:14,219
when it comes to, you know, big, um, big meetings or big, you know, I've got a big emphasis on a

474
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:18,860
message that I want to send is, is going through a process of, of discussing it with a few people

475
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,820
to make sure I'm, you know, clear. And that involves my teammates, it involves, you know,

476
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:28,760
Bevo, Lisa, um, and that allows me to have that confidence, I reckon, to be sort of, you know,

477
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,719
clear with my communication. And, and, um, once again, you're dealing with, you know, 18 year

478
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,460
olds to, to 30 sort of five year olds. So you need to, you know, be able to provide, um, you know,

479
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,179
communication that's clear for, for obviously all ages and that you really don't want people sort of

480
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:47,000
walking away a bit unsure about, about what you're saying or the message you're trying to send. So,

481
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,840
um, definitely something that I,

482
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,539
continue to work on, but feel like, um, yeah, it's, it's something I've naturally sort of had a

483
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,480
bit of, um, ability to do. Bon, in, uh, the work we're doing with, uh, the leadership space,

484
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,940
our tagline is this world of collaboration and we're seeing great leaders want to collaborate

485
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,139
to, to do all the things you're talking about. Um, how important has collaboration been for you?

486
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,340
Huge, really, really big. I think, um, it's the one thing that definitely,

487
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:18,159
you know, you know, I can't speak for before my time at the football club, but from the

488
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:25,059
sort of 14 year, my first season, then going forward is the, um, you know, like you probably

489
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:30,239
spoke to, there probably was still some, some hierarchy, all those, um, pretty clear, um,

490
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,719
lines of, of hierarchy when I joined the club. And it's something that, that, you know, Bevo was

491
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,320
able to do pretty quickly is sort of flatten everything out, um, and have everyone feel like

492
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:46,179
they're valued, like their, their opinion and their, their thoughts, um, were, were willing

493
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:51,980
to be recognized, um, and basically to create once again, that empowerment of, of, of everyone

494
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,639
and helping everyone understand that you need everyone on a journey like this. Um, so it's

495
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,000
something that I continue, I continue to do. We, you know, create spaces for, you know, the, the

496
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,260
team and our different age groups to, to get together and bring up, you know, concerns or

497
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,519
positives, um, and bring those things to the table. And, um, you know, the, the football club

498
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,800
environment of, you know, standing out in front of you, your mates, um,

499
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:20,079
or, you know, people you sort of look up to, or those that you're scared of is quite a daunting,

500
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,019
daunting process. So we really try to break that down and try and we, I guess we circle up now

501
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:29,000
rather than sitting in a, in a theater. So it's just little things that create an environment

502
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,340
for people to feel more comfortable and more willing to, to open up and, and, and, you know,

503
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,460
potentially take a leap of faith and say something that, um, they've been thinking about or chewing

504
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,239
on. So, um, you need everyone to feel like they're a part of it. That's certainly the message. Yeah.

505
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,099
To me, there's great, uh, learnings for, you know, people listening to that in, in small

506
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:51,320
business or whatever discipline in education or whatever passionate idea that you are really

507
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,980
properly listening and wanting people regardless of whether it's your first year or your 12th or

508
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,500
15th year. And, you know, you can clearly see that environment that you've led, uh, is something that

509
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,800
works incredibly well. It's such a healthy and, um, positive environment. It's incredibly

510
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,320
impressive. I've been asking these two questions, Bond, of, uh, all the, um, inspirational leaders.

511
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,760
I've really, uh, been fortunate to, to speak to people like yourself and, um, two final questions

512
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,820
for you. Who's been the greatest leader in your life? Um, oh, it's, it's hard to go past my, my dad.

513
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,480
I think family's always, um, you know, the, the people that you, you know, spend the most time

514
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,739
with, but you get, um, probably the, the greatest understanding of my dad was, um, you know,

515
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,860
a concreter from a very young age from a, you know, an Italian family. So that seems to be,

516
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,500
um, where a lot of the Italians obviously ended up in, in the concreting business, but, um,

517
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,380
he was someone, you know, just from a, you know, you know, uh, watching

518
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,059
worked incredibly hard, you know, provided obviously, um, for our family, um, you know,

519
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,039
clearly with mum as well, but, you know, concreting is a really, you know, hard business. People who,

520
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,840
who work in that, in that industry and probably the building industry in general, they work,

521
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,800
you know, obviously long hours and it's very physical work. Um, but he definitely, when it

522
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,579
came to, you know, my football and when I was probably 15 or 16, felt like I was, um, you know,

523
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:14,320
falling further and further away maybe from the football dream, which I'd sort of prayed and hoped

524
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,619
for since a very young age.

525
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,659
But, um, sometimes you just need that person sort of in your life who can give you the confidence,

526
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:24,280
um, and lift your, lift your spirits and lift you up. And he did that for me, you know, pretty much

527
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,519
around that age. And, um, it's, it's just, he's someone I can, you know, rely on someone in your

528
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,699
life that, you know, always be there regardless. And her mum and dad are both the same in that

529
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:41,400
vein, but, um, his work ethic and, and his, um, you know, his appetite to, you know, always,

530
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,420
you know, remember your family values is, is really strong. And that definitely has run,

531
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:45,739
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

532
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,440
true with me for sure. And he, you know, was such a big influence for me from such a young age that,

533
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:53,920
um, yeah, he continues to do that sort of regardless. Yeah.

534
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,500
Well, I haven't heard you talk about that for a lot of, you know, if, if there's kids listening

535
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,280
that, that 15 years of age is a tough thing in sport for, you know, you get the early developers

536
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,500
who, who jump out and have a massive size and strength advantage and, you know, kids lose

537
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,579
their confidence at that age. Did that happen to you a little bit where you're a bit of a later

538
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:09,980
developer?

539
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:14,719
Yeah. And I wasn't sure how, you know, far back you wanted to go, um, sort of with this,

540
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,599
with this chap, but definitely.

541
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,960
Definitely as a, you know, 14, 15 year old, um, late developer born later in the year.

542
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,099
Um, probably, yeah, lacked a bit of confidence at that age when, when players, you know,

543
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,179
start either get bigger, grow faster. Um, and once again, your mates around you are

544
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:36,579
all progressing, but you seem to be, you know, stuck in mud almost. Um, and yeah, dad was

545
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,420
probably the one that probably saw me slowly like questioning or doubting. And I imagine

546
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,239
as a, as a father, you, you, you see that and try to do everything you can to, to continue

547
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,579
to try and, um.

548
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,920
Um, you know, push your, push your son along. Um, and, you know, I'd spent, you know, it's

549
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,139
funny, I spend, you know, school holidays, I'd, I'd work with him, you know, and, and

550
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:58,159
sort of developed. And, and that's probably where I got a sense for how hard he worked.

551
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:02,559
Like I think, you know, that two week school holiday period you got, I'd spend, you know,

552
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,800
with him being his lackey, just going to get different things for him, like not doing a

553
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,659
whole lot, but just sort of watching. Um, and actually being able to do that probably

554
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:14,719
gave me a greater appreciation for, for how hard he worked. And then the things that he

555
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,579
did, you know, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,

556
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:19,800
just to provide for, for our family. So I really probably even just now think about

557
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,940
that and think what a, what a great opportunity it was to, to do that. And it also probably

558
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,800
gave me a, you know, a look at, oh, I think if I can make this football thing work, I'd

559
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,400
probably prefer to do that maybe. Um, then be, you know, pouring concrete. Um, so it's,

560
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,800
you know, and maybe he thought about that. Maybe he didn't. Maybe, you know, he thought

561
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,360
it's a good insight into, you know, what I do and potentially what you can maybe go and

562
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,559
do if you work hard enough for it. So inadvertently he's probably had an impact like that,

563
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:48,900
without even probably thinking it, or maybe he was smarter than I give him credit for

564
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,800
and did. Um, but definitely as a 15 year old, I sensed I was, you know, falling behind and,

565
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,699
and had a bit of a growth spurt probably when I was, you know, 16, 17. Um, and I remember

566
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:03,360
him, you know, we went down to one of the training sessions, um, at the Northern Knights,

567
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:07,940
um, more or less just to show, try and show me that, you know, it's sort of a bit in your

568
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,539
head that, you know, these kids are good, but you're definitely, you know, capable enough

569
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,559
to be sort of out there, out there training. Um, and like I said, I think that's, I think

570
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:20,119
that he'd be, he would be out the back with me, you know, didn't grow up playing much

571
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,599
sport or play, you know, football, um, like I did. And he'd be doing his best just to

572
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,019
try and, I guess, support his son in, in what he sort of hopes and dreams were. So, um,

573
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:33,659
yeah, I definitely felt myself, I guess, coming back to the initial question, falling a bit

574
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:38,219
behind. He was there for, from a confidence perspective to try and sort of continue to

575
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,400
lift my spirits. And, and sure enough, I managed to, to grow, develop a bit more confidence

576
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,559
and then really come on late sort of in my, I guess, my dream.

577
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:50,199
Um, which was sort of all started with his, you know, initial push.

578
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,039
What a gift that is to have someone like that in your life. And, uh, and still to this day,

579
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,480
the final question is back to the, uh, the word of collaboration. If you're asking this

580
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,900
question, if you could collaborate with anyone that could be in any part of your life, uh,

581
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,619
Bono, I know you've got passions outside of your love of football, but if there was any

582
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,880
collaboration, any person who would spring to mind?

583
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:13,980
Oh, straight away, I think sort of Roger Federer, um, which, um, you know, maybe that's just

584
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,480
from a, um,

585
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:20,340
you know, he's an incredible, you know, obviously, you know, tennis player, but I've always admired

586
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,199
the way that he sort of handles himself, um, clearly off, off the court and the things

587
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,960
that he does, how he speaks. Um, there's a real, um, genuine sort of nature to, to him.

588
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:36,039
Um, and I think a lot of people are in the very similar vein of, of how they sort of

589
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:41,320
see him. And, um, he's a, you know, authentic person. And I love that probably about him

590
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,559
as he can, you know, um, yeah, represent, um, you know, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's

591
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:49,139
a, you know, such a, you know, really nice and caring and, you know, nurturing sort of

592
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:54,500
personality, um, and be such a, you know, obviously a, a successful sort of tennis player

593
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,219
and athlete. So, um, he'd be one that I think if you could just sort of sit down and have

594
00:45:58,219 --> 00:45:59,460
a coffee with, it'd be really interesting.

595
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,260
I feel like, uh, you're cut from a very similar cloth to that man. I'm not surprised by, uh,

596
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,639
that answer and, uh, you know, the same values that come out in this conversation. Uh, I'm

597
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,000
not sure I've had the chance to say this to you before, but, uh, as someone who's lucky

598
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,320
enough to play at the club that you're the captain of, uh, what you've done and the way

599
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:21,820
you've inspired, um, so many people has really changed the game for people who love the red,

600
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,579
white, and blue. And, uh, you know, I think, um, you know, the successes that you guys

601
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:28,960
have achieved, but probably the way you've gone about it has made, uh, I think all of

602
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,800
our passion for the club we played for even greater. So I, I feel like we need to say

603
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,619
thank you. We love watching you from afar and, uh, love talking to you anytime we get

604
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,480
the chance and appreciate you taking the time today.

605
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,780
