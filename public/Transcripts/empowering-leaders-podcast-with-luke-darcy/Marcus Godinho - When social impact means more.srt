00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,899
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,300
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:52,990
Marcus Godinho's impact on those less fortunate and in need

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,469
is a great Australian story.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,750
FairShare, founded in 2007, is a charity that works with businesses

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,929
to cook surplus food into free, nutritious meals.

15
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,390
FairShare operates Australia's largest charity kitchens

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,750
where every week, 1,000 volunteers cook more than 50,000 meals.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,450
They collect food that business can no longer use,

18
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,890
vegetables that no longer look perfect but are perfectly edible,

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,969
meat approaching its use-by date,

20
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,829
pastry off-cultivation,

21
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,170
cuts from commercial bakeries,

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,969
high-fibre bread not sold on the day it was baked

23
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,329
are some of the examples.

24
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,870
Each of FairShare's ready-to-eat meals contain at least half

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,750
an adult's recommended daily intake of protein and vegetables

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,950
to improve the diet and health of people who have fallen on hard times.

27
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,989
Marcus' outstanding contribution is seen and recognised

28
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:42,290

as well as holding an MBA and a Commerce degree.

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,969
Marcus, congratulations on an incredible amount of work that you've done.

36
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,629
I feel like a lot of us feel really bad about food waste.

37
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,710
Not many people turn that into 50,000 nutritious meals a week

38
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,789
that were destined for landfill.

39
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,590
Can you tell us about how your story started with FairShare?

40
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,949
Oh, Luke, thanks so much.

41
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:14,849
It's great to be with you.

42
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,590
Look, it's funny how these journeys start,

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
but, I mean,

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,550
my roots are probably different to many others who are involved with FairShare

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,889
and it started from an environmental perspective

46
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,090
and having been involved with environmental issues for some time,

47
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,129
you know, water issues, climate change,

48
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,030
I could see that things were going to emerge on the food front

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,870
when you think about all the resources that go into producing food.

50
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,909
And I guess being of Mediterranean extraction and loving food

51
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,710
and cooking it and entertaining,

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,050
when I heard about a group of people getting together

53
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,289
and using surplus food

54
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,250
to, you know, not just spend time together in a kitchen,

55
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,289
but to cook it for people going hungry in Melbourne.

56
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,229
Oh, okay.

57
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,330
Are there people going hungry?

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,129
So I offered to help out on a Saturday morning.

59
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,810
I went down and loved it, really enjoyed it.

60
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,650
So I said I'd come down next Saturday.

61
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,789
And it was one of those early revelations for me.

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,870
The woman said, no, you can come back once a month.

63
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,909
We've got many people wanting to volunteer with us.

64
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,250
But look, it was just such a small-scale operation.

65
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:21,289
But I just loved that concept of taking food

66
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,349
that was otherwise going to go to landfill

67
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,889
and doing something with it.

68
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,569
And I'm not the only one to have had that thought.

69
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,569
There are some great organisations out there rescuing food.

70
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,689
Yeah, and I think, you know, listening to your story

71
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,949
and researching your story,

72
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,330
the nutritious healthy element to what you've done.

73
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,189
And 15 years later, I think you said to me,

74
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,889
there are 2,000 meals a year that were being produced back then,

75
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,449
up to 3 million meals a year.

76
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,969
You can correct me on the numbers there.

77
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,870
But, yeah, it's incredible growth.

78
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,650
It's an incredible impact you're having.

79
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,550
And you really wanted to focus on making sure

80
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,349
that it wasn't just surplus food that was going,

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,569
regardless of the quality.

82
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,469
You wanted to focus on the quality

83
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,129
of what you were preparing for people as well.

84
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,650
Yeah, look, it's Australia.

85
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,969
It's not North Korea.

86
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,250
It's not Horn of Africa.

87
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:12,270
We've got different, I guess, diet-related health issues here.

88
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,550
And what we find is that most people who are struggling

89
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,269
for...

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,790
or food, with food insecurity,

91
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,569
are struggling to access healthy food,

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,350
are struggling to cook meals themselves.

93
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,829
So it's not just a matter of feeding hungry tummies.

94
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,329
It's a matter of actually trying to get nutritious food

95
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:36,069
into their diets to improve their health.

96
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,810
And I was speaking to a nutritionist, Karen Inge,

97
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,949
who has a history with the Hawthorne Football Club.

98
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,110
She's done a lot of work in nutrition in football.

99
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,670
And she said to me, she used a term

100
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,769
that I'd never heard before, but I immediately

101
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,610
knew what she meant, malnubicity.

102
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,730
And it resonated because from having gone out

103
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,389
to a lot of local charities over the years

104
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,750
where our meals are being served, you'd

105
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,930
see people turning up, receiving food, who were just

106
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,629
a bit overweight.

107
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,449
And you think, gee.

108
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,029
And what she's describing is that there's malnubicity,

109
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,470
there's type 2 diabetes.

110
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,009
And it's a great play on words.

111
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,509
But that's where we really want to go,

112
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,490
is that it's not just about calories.

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,050
It's not just about any food.

114
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,769
It's about getting nutrition into the diets

115
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,269
that people are doing it tough.

116
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,829
Yeah, it's a fascinating term, that for mine, isn't it?

117
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,470
And in some ways, we do ape American culture a lot,

118
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,230
don't we, in the over-processed food that's become

119
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,269
part of Australians' diet.

120
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,490
And you're seeing, I hadn't heard that term before,

121
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,269
but it is.

122
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,410
It's accurate, isn't it?

123
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,329
It makes sense, doesn't it?

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,589
People that are overweight and unhealthy,

125
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,269
but really having poor diets.

126
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,350
I read this feedback from one of your customers,

127
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,889
I suppose, if that's the right term,

128
00:05:58,949 --> 00:05:59,970
or one of the people in need.

129
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,410
And I wanted to read it back to you,

130
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,250
because I'm assuming this is what you do it for.

131
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,129
It's such nice food.

132
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,970
I get my veggies, some beautiful roast usually,

133
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,930
and they serve it hot.

134
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,589
Lots of places just have white bread and sausage,

135
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,329
which is OK now and then.

136
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:13,930
But I need to keep healthy.

137
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,470
It was lamb last week.

138
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,750
I haven't had lamb in ages.

139
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,269
It was so good.

140
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,910
It was so special.

141
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,829
So much thanks to the chef and those volunteers.

142
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,410
They make such a difference.

143
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,329
It really gives me something to look forward to.

144
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,290
That sounds life-changing to me.

145
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,990
Is that what you do it for?

146
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:34,089
Oh, look, we don't get as much feedback from the front line,

147
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,430
from people who receive it.

148
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,290
And you can understand, given the stress that they're under,

149
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,689
that we're not going to.

150
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,629
But, jeez, when you get it, it makes you feel good.

151
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,949
And then to share it.

152
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,170
I make sure I do with the volunteers,

153
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,189
the hundreds of volunteers.

154
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,629
We've got a lot of volunteers that we've got coming down regularly

155
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,589
with the businesses that donate food because, I mean,

156
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,350
that's what it's about.

157
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,089
Yes, it's about stopping food from being wasted,

158
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,250
and that was our genesis, and that's how we do it.

159
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,730
But it's about the difference you can make to someone's life.

160
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,250
And, yeah, malnutrition, obesity, it's a cool term,

161
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,089
that malnubicity.

162
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,790
But, yeah, I think in Australia, society,

163
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,790
for too long,

164
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,569
has relied on this coming together,

165
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,910
which is what you want of sectors, government, business,

166
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,269
the third sector relying on businesses have surplus food.

167
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,370
They give it to charities,

168
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,670
and charities give it to people who are doing it tough.

169
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,329
And it's kilos of food.

170
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,149
They're equated to meals, in averted commas,

171
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,589
but it's just kilos of food.

172
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,029
And some of it can be pretty wacky.

173
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,250
But, really, I think we need to shift.

174
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,629
And I can see this starting,

175
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:47,250
starting from,

176
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:51,029
from there just being just kilos of food,

177
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,029
any food being passed on that,

178
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,829
as one woman from the front line said to me,

179
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,069
can just exacerbate the diet-related health issues.

180
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,889
We need to move to food that is actually going to improve the quality of life,

181
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,350
the diet, the health of people who've fallen on hard times.

182
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,649
We need to start with a demand, not start with a supply.

183
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,949
And so we've really switched our thinking at FairShare from being pushed to being

184
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,050
poor, from being supply to being demand.

185
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:23,470
How can we actually address some of the issues that are being tackled by those at the front line,

186
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,170
those local charities who are helping those people who are doing it tough?

187
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,810
You're just kind enough to give me a tour of the facility here in Abbotsford in Melbourne.

188
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,649
And you can see the volunteers hard at work and,

189
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,710
you know, beautiful chicken casseroles and meals that you look at and go,

190
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,950
get me involved in some of that.

191
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,870
We are here talking leadership.

192
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,009
It's the passion that I've got around what leadership looks like in different spaces.

193
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,490
For you to mobilise a thousand volunteers a week,

194
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,190
you've got to deal with partners, huge partners like Woolworths and the logistics

195
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,990
and the organisation of that.

196
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,409
Can you tell us something that takes a lot of skill?

197
00:08:58,809 --> 00:08:59,809
How have you gone about it?

198
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:03,529
Look, there are different ways of going about things.

199
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,110
The way that I've gone about FairShare is by providing an opportunity for people

200
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,970
to participate in something.

201
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,110
And I've seen with some charities, they raise a bit of money,

202
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,870
they pump it into PR, they pump it into fundraising.

203
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,570
And their brand builds.

204
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,370
And that's a formula for success.

205
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,590
And a lot of those charities do great work.

206
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:32,269
We've taken a different path and it's provide individuals a chance to regularly volunteer.

207
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,950
It's provide businesses with a chance to donate their food.

208
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,330
It's have corporates, have their groups of staff come down and participate.

209
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,149
Service clubs, rotaries, lines, have them come down and volunteer with us.

210
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:46,870
Yeah.

211
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,929
And you never know who's in the kitchen.

212
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,090
And I always say to the chefs, be careful what you say,

213
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,049
because you never know who's listening and what they pick up on.

214
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,370
And there are some wonderful stories of people who've got involved under the radar at FairShare.

215
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,750
And just, it's not serendipity, it's deliberate.

216
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,230
We've tried to get people involved with FairShare.

217
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,049
And we've known that by doing so, there'd be some people who could be pretty influential come

218
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,029
through without necessarily heralding who they are.

219
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,169
But then, having had a good experience or having spent time with us, have then gone

220
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,049
away and helped us.

221
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,409
There's countless stories of people like that.

222
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:34,669
And it just makes my heart sing, spending time with individuals and with organisations

223
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:39,490
and the feedback that I get from those who participate about what it means to them.

224
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,210
And I think these days, that's one of the most rewarding things.

225
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,210
Yes, we're stopping food from being wasted.

226
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,809
We're helping people who are doing it tough.

227
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:55,330
But there's this unintended byproduct, which is volunteering, and it's an input, but it's

228
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,330
also an output.

229
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,330
Yeah.

230
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,649
And you can tangibly feel it just walking through your organisation a few moments ago.

231
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:07,409
You can see this sense of community and this sense of participation that clearly you've

232
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,409
created.

233
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,769
There are a lot of charities, Marcus, and a lot of great ventures with great intentions

234
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,429
and great causes.

235
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,210
But very few have the huge social impact.

236
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,990
And I think that's the real impact that FairShare and you are having, and you have it educated

237
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,990
in this space.

238
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,230
What's the key for people that do want to make an impact and have got a good idea in

239
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,230
this space?

240
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,389
How do you make the biggest impact?

241
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,389
How would you describe that?

242
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,970
Well, I hear quite often people going out and saying, look, I want to do something on

243
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,970
this.

244
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,389
I'm setting up a charity or I'm setting up a foundation.

245
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:39,629
And I think people can solve and rush to that.

246
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:42,690
What's critical is you actually do your homework first.

247
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,330
And I've had that many conversations with people saying, look, I've had a great day.

248
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,330
I've had a great day.

249
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,169
I've had a great day.

250
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,169
I've had a great time in the corporate sector.

251
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,389
I want to move into the community sector.

252
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:51,389
What was your path?

253
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:52,389
What's your recommendation?

254
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:58,450
And I always start with, you need to actually identify what are you passionate about?

255
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,509
What keeps you up at night?

256
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,629
What puts fire in your belly?

257
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,850
And so finding what that is, is it climate change?

258
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,470
Is it human trafficking?

259
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,950
Is it kids cancer?

260
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,570
Look, there are so many important issues.

261
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,450
There are so many great organizations working on these issues.

262
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,629
So to find that.

263
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,950
To then do your research.

264
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,190
And to, well, who's working on it?

265
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:25,070
And different organizations do different types of things, play different roles on issues.

266
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,950
Some are doing advocacy, some are doing practical action.

267
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,450
Are you more the activist type of person?

268
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:37,710
Are you the person who just wants to plant trees rather than be tying themselves to a

269
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,710
tree?

270
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,450
So there are different ways that you can get involved, finding your passion, working out

271
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,070
which organizations.

272
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,070
Finding, volunteering with organizations to help find yourself.

273
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:57,769
And then finding yourself working for an organization and then, look, yeah, you don't know where

274
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:58,769
these journeys.

275
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,570
Well, that's an interesting point that I'd like to pick up on, because I look at you

276
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,970
and I'm an incredibly intelligent guy, incredibly articulate, incredibly well-educated.

277
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,750
You could turn your attention, I feel like, to anything in the commercial sector and probably

278
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,070
make lots and lots of money if you so choose.

279
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,070
Yeah.

280
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,830
So how do you balance that out with wanting to support your family plus contribute to

281
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,110
so many others like you do?

282
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,190
I was fortunate because I started off in the corporate sector and I had a good decade there

283
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,210
and I was pretty frugal and saved and bought a house.

284
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,149
So I got off to a good start and I think that held me in good stead.

285
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:41,690
And probably not as easy to do these days with cost of living pressures and real estate.

286
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,870
And that's where I've seen some people who've had it.

287
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,649
I've seen people who've had tremendous impact, who have both juggled a career and careers

288
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,990
that have been well remunerated and also doing things on the side.

289
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,889
I mean, a close friend and colleague very quietly spent 12 years chairing a disability

290
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:09,669
accommodation organization that has had incredible impact, did very well in business, but at

291
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:13,870
the same time was doing tremendous community work.

292
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,690
So often these things happen at different stages of your life and not everybody's going

293
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,870
to be an activist from straight out of school or straight out of university.

294
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,529
But I think it's a matter of people finding their balance between career and community

295
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:29,529
service.

296
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,389
And look, if you've got young kids, you don't have as much time and you might back off and

297
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,230
I find myself doing that now.

298
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,210
But then you might be able to step up when your kids are a bit older, when you've got

299
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,190
a bit more time, maybe career wise.

300
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,190
So yeah.

301
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,429
I don't think it's the same for everybody through their life.

302
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,429
Yeah.

303
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,429
Look, I think most people have that idea of wanting to contribute, wanting to do that

304
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:56,470
effectively, balancing that, as you said, with the day-to-day needs of raising your

305
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,470
family.

306
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,470
Where is that point?

307
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,250
And I've spoken to a lot of people in the charitable space.

308
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,250
That's a hard...

309
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,610
Even so, what do you pay yourself when you run a charity?

310
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,610
How do you start there?

311
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,029
I mean, what's the balance?

312
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,809
How do you incentivize people like you to do it?

313
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,049
Is that a path that you've had to tread?

314
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,049
Yeah.

315
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,049
Look, I get pretty personal with this.

316
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,049
Yeah.

317
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,990
There've been a few arm wrestles.

318
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,730
I remember once my president said, look, we're grateful for the work you've done.

319
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,730
We want to give you a pay rise.

320
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,049
And I said, look, I'm comfortable with what I'm being remunerated.

321
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,049
What did your wife say, though?

322
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,750
I can tell what my parents said.

323
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,730
But I said, look, at the end of conversation, I do the pays at fair share, so I'm not going

324
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,730
to give myself an increase.

325
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,090
Oh, look, I think it's about being honest.

326
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,710
I think it's about benchmarking what's reasonable in the community sector and paying at that

327
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,049
level.

328
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:02,049
But conversely, the labor market in the community sector is competitive, as elsewhere.

329
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:08,110
And there's an argument going that if you actually pay a little bit more and get somebody

330
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,970
a little bit better, then you actually can have more impact.

331
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,210
So I think the notion of just looking at, and I've had this conversation with people

332
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:21,590
before, just looking at the payroll or the pay rates of charities, how much they're paying

333
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,649
people, it's the wrong way to look at it.

334
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,870
You really need to be looking at, well, what impact is that charity?

335
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,850
People say, well, what percentage do you spend on administration?

336
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,090
Wrong conversation to be having.

337
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,289
What impact is the organization having?

338
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,289
Yeah.

339
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,289
Yeah.

340
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,289
Yeah.

341
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:47,470
I think there are charities out there that do what they do really well, and they've got

342
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,470
a good reputation.

343
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,789
They tell a good story.

344
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:53,710
They raise money to sustain what they do.

345
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,529
But decade after decade, what impact are they actually having?

346
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,730
So it was one of those things in that Harvard course you referenced that they really drummed

347
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,730
on about.

348
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,750
You've got to look at the impact of your work.

349
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,309
It's not just doing it well.

350
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:08,309
What difference is it making?

351
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:09,569
Marcus, I interviewed Dan Flynn, the founder of Thank You World.

352
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,569
Thank you.

353
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,569
He's the founder of Thank You Water on this podcast, who I found a really interesting

354
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,190
and inspirational story, and a significant change maker in what he's done in that space.

355
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,930
But he spoke about the not-for-profit sector held to a bar much higher than the commercial

356
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,930
sector.

357
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:35,009
If you wanted to innovate here at Fair Share and spend some money that may be investment

358
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,750
for the long term, there can often be a critical eye on, as you said, what was the cost of

359
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,750
that?

360
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:46,990
And perhaps we don't get that innovation in that sector at times because there isn't that

361
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,430
wiggle room given.

362
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,869
Is that something you subscribe to?

363
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,109
Or do you think you can work that out okay?

364
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,970
I don't know whether I necessarily agree with that.

365
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:06,750
I think there's a lot of ... Look, people who fund the community sector vary quite a

366
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
bit.

367
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,750
You've got government.

368
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
You've got corporate.

369
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,069
You've got philanthropic.

370
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:19,089
Philanthropy can take risks and back good ideas and exercise their judgment around people.

371
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,869
Government has to be more cautious.

372
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:26,930
Using taxpayers' funding, corporate, they've got their reputation that's worth so much.

373
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,990
So look, I think it varies depending on where the funding's coming from, who you're talking

374
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,990
about.

375
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,750
I don't think it's as simple as that.

376
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,750
There's ... I think within the ... I think within the ... I think within the ... I think

377
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,750
within the ... I think within the ... I think within the ... I think within the ... I think

378
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,970
within a lot of giving it's, well, what's the cause?

379
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,410
Is the cause important to me?

380
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,710
Do I have confidence in the organisation and how it's going about its model to addressing

381
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,710
that cause?

382
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,930
Then who's working on it and do I like that person?

383
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,569
Do I trust that person?

384
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:01,230
I think if you've got that alignment between a funder, your cause is important to them.

385
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:07,069
They have confidence in the organisation and they respect the person, then I think you

386
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,069
do have some latitude.

387
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:31,890
And what we're seeing happening more and more, and we need to see more of this in Australia in giving, is that philanthropy is pivoting to not just one year funding of projects, of something that's tangible, but actually saying that organisation does good work that has impact on an issue that's important to us.

388
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:49,690
So we're just going to back it to do what it judges as being important. So it's what we refer to as backing the OPEX of the organisation, because a lot of people want to fund the brick in the building. They want to fund the oven or the cool room or the van. But what we don't want is stranded assets.

389
00:19:49,690 --> 00:20:01,509
We don't want an oven that looks great and costs $50,000, but we can't afford to pay the chef or the electricity or the maintenance for that oven to turn out meals. So that's where we're having that conversation.

390
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:22,210
That conversation is taking place within philanthropy. We're certainly fuelling it. We want it to take place because we want organisations to just back us to do what we do. Because I've had the conversation with quite a few politicians, oh, we'll support you with your capital expenditure, but not on your operating costs, which is not surprising, but it's not particularly helpful.

391
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:30,170
It's a great answer, because it makes sense, doesn't it? This is what our expertise is in. We're competing, if you like, with anyone.

392
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,470
Your expertise.

393
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:56,910
Your skills around creating nutritious meals for those in need is world-class. Just trust the process with accountability that we're going to be doing. My mind's also going, Jeff Harris, the founder of Flight Centre, who's an incredible person in the philanthropy world, he was talking about social ventures being underutilised in Australia and not really understood, and that other parts of the world were way ahead of encouraging.

394
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,430
Can you first of all describe the difference between not-for-profit and social venture, and are you a subscriber?

395
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,390
Are you a subscriber to the social venture world?

396
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:20,069
Oh, look, absolutely. I agree with Jeff. There's a place for both, though. Jeff's been a fantastic backer of Street. A woman called Bec Scott set that up. Her creative thinking and entrepreneurial flair is inspiring. I always feel so inadequate when I'm speaking with her.

397
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:31,069
And not everything works. Not everything's going to work commercially or in social enterprises. But what she's doing, what Jeff's backing her to do, what he's talking about is…

398
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:56,970
A way of running something that, through doing what it does, has social benefits. So, for instance, a cafe that's taking at-risk kids and training them in some basic hospitality skills, the cafe is breaking even or making a little bit of money, but there's a social benefit from doing what it does because of the way it does it.

399
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,390
Now, that's a relatively new model compared to a charity.

400
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:22,710
Like FairShare, which exists and runs in as efficient way as possible to provide a service to the community to have impact. So, I think there's a role for both. And this is one of the things that I've struggled with over the years because people have said to me, oh, FairShare needs to have a social enterprise.

401
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:31,470
And my response has always been, yeah, a friend of mine says he always wants to buy a business. And I said, well, what do you know about? And what's your idea?

402
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:59,789
And, you know, if you're going into business, it's not quite this straightforward. It's the same for a charity. Okay, you think we should do a social enterprise, but what? I don't have an idea, for one. But I'm open to it. I'd love to. And it's not to say that at FairShare, we wouldn't do one. I think you've got to start with the idea. But certainly, both charities and social enterprises can both do fantastic work and have impact.

403
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,950
You're affected.

404
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:21,490
Like everyone else here in the city of Melbourne, the core base of your business, it was the longest lockdown in the world. From a charity point of view, you've got 200 volunteers a day. How did you approach that?

405
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:37,990
Panic. I think a 72-hour funk. Look, I remember this so vividly. The FairShare model's based on participation. So, get as many people in, shoulder to shoulder, through the kitchen a day.

406
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:51,549
It's the anti-COVID environment. The advice from government was to have as few people on site over the course of a week as possible. And so, I flipped just, it's the opposite to how we roll.

407
00:23:52,750 --> 00:24:06,609
And so, yeah, it was 72 hours. And I vividly recall on the Thursday, coming out of this funk and saying, no, you need to find a way of changing the way we operate.

408
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,890
Because what FairShare does...

409
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:21,750
It's going to be needed more than ever. But we're going to have to do it differently. And I've had this wonderful partnership with a woman called Kelly, who's been with us for 12 years, like myself, started as a volunteer and could do anything.

410
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:37,750
And so, I rang her up on the Friday and said, look, we need to remodel. We want to operate, we've got to operate with a very small number of highly productive paid hospitality workers and suspend volunteering. And so, she facetiously said, oh my God, that'd be so much easier.

411
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,869
Yeah.

412
00:24:37,869 --> 00:25:07,849
But you've just been complaining about having written off all of this income because we're not going to be able to do fundraisers. And you've been talking about we can't operate with volunteers for all the obvious reasons. But yeah, okay, I'll go away and model it for you. And it was just one of those moments that was, I say good fortune more than good luck. But the very next day, mid-Saturday, I got a phone call from the state government. And it was a senior bureaucrat. And he said, hi, mate.

413
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:37,849
Hi, Marcus. My name's Jim. We've met a few times through a mutual friend. I've been thinking, you do important work for Victoria and we don't ordinarily fund you. We're going to need you more than ever. And I've been thinking, you can't do what you do with volunteers. And I've been thinking, there's all of these hospitality workers that are losing their jobs. So, I want to get in 24 hours a proposal from you to suspend volunteering and put on laid off hospitality workers so that you can not just suspend volunteering.

414
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,450
You can't sustain what you do, but you can scale. Sorry, mate, what's your name? How do we know each other?

415
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,210
How good a call is that, Marcus?

416
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,589
How good a call. So, I straight away hung up and rang Kelly and said, right, you know what we talked about yesterday?

417
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,069
It's on.

418
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:59,990
It's on. It's on. And within Monday week after that phone call, we had suspended all of our volunteering. And that wasn't an easy thing to do.

419
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:16,529
And we had more than 70 highly productive paid kitchen workers in the kitchen. And in between those two days, I remember that was the Saturday phone call.

420
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:23,390
The Sunday phone call, I was at home playing Dungeons and Dragons with my sons around the kitchen table and the phone rang and it was pretty boisterous.

421
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:29,970
But I took it because, you know, everything was happening so quickly back then. And it was, Marcus, Marcus.

422
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,329
It's Marcus. It's Brad Banducci from Woolworths here. And I had the CEO of Woolworths on the phone committing to support.

423
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,630
And then the following day, I had Bruce Matheson from the ALH group.

424
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:51,930
So, what we were able to do very quickly was suspend volunteering, the usual model, rely less on surplus food.

425
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:58,269
And that's where Brad committed to buying $100,000 a week of meat and vegetables for us.

426
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,970
And we had...

427
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:10,210
Bruce Matheson at the ALH group putting in around 70 full-time staff of his that couldn't go to work, that he was paying, you know, their usual place of work was shut.

428
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:14,930
And he had them in at fair share in our Brisbane kitchen, in our Melbourne kitchen.

429
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:21,529
And so, that's why we scaled to cook about 140,000 meals a week and a great range of meals.

430
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:28,910
And I remember one of the chefs stopped me and he said, I can't believe the quality of food that's going out of this place and going out to local charities.

431
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,890
How good's this?

432
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,049
It was terrific.

433
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,170
It's an amazing story.

434
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,769
Incredible in that short amount of time.

435
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,650
And it's probably a lifetime of work because not many people get to see Woolies calling on their private phone.

436
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:41,869
That takes time, you know.

437
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,710
I think that was it.

438
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,490
I say good fortune and there was a reaction there.

439
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,769
But there was a relationship there with somebody who remembered me talking about fair share, which I'm always doing.

440
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,289
There was Brad Banducci and we've worked with Woolworths for 14 years.

441
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,289
And they're...

442
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,049
They've got a relationship with the ALH group, obviously.

443
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,750
And so, yeah.

444
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,069
And there's a reputation there.

445
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,470
There are relationships there.

446
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,930
There are partnerships with corporates.

447
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,230
So, it was a lot of things coming together.

448
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:12,990
It wasn't just serendipity.

449
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,089
A lot of trust, isn't it?

450
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,130
And I love the bureaucrat story.

451
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,529
And we're often critical of bureaucracy and we should celebrate.

452
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,349
That's great thinking and great initiative with all that was going on in Melbourne.

453
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,430
Yeah, a lot of us were critical.

454
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,210
It's easy to be critical, but you've got to come up with a solution as well.

455
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:30,690
So, what a brilliant story.

456
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,609
We need to find that person, Marcus, and celebrate them better for their initiative.

457
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:40,750
We've been looking at a range of leaders and I love your leadership story.

458
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,190
It's brilliant.

459
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:47,529
And that's a great example of it right in the making in the most challenging time to turn that into the success it is.

460
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:54,230
And we're seeing these sort of common traits appear across different leadership and wanting to pick up the cues and learn for them.

461
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,730
We think most people who are leading the way you are with the self-reflection and care have a sense of self-care.

462
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:58,750
Yeah.

463
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,029
They have a sense of self-leadership.

464
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,569
What does that mean to you?

465
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,430
Oh, look, it really starts with understanding yourself.

466
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,170
Look, there are a lot of very intelligent, much more intelligent people than me out there.

467
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:21,410
But I remember hearing many years ago, to be successful leading an organization, it's not just about your IQ.

468
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:22,710
It's also about your EQ.

469
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:28,250
And that's understanding yourself and being able to manage yourself and understanding others and being able to relate.

470
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,230
So I think that self-awareness is critical.

471
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:45,930
It's about really working with your strengths, playing to those, and not bashing yourself up because of your weaknesses, working on them where you need to, but also bringing people around you who complement who you are.

472
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:54,369
And I think that for me at FairShare, one of the things I'm really proud of is having recruited people.

473
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:58,309
I mean, not just staff, but it's the board that we have of volunteer directors.

474
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,049
It's businesses, being able to bring them and have them stick with us.

475
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:09,009
But look, aren't we our own harshest critics?

476
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:11,309
And I bash myself up all the time.

477
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,670
But yeah, and I probably need to spend more time reflecting on who I am.

478
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:28,289
I think one of the things for me in this whole journey has been, I mean, I started in the not-for-profit.

479
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,970
I started in the not-for-profit space with an environmental advocacy group.

480
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:37,869
And I was passionate and committed and gave so much of myself.

481
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,130
It was before kids.

482
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,809
But the thing that I found really hard was the combative nature of it.

483
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,450
It wasn't like at FairShare where it's a no-brainer and people just say, that just makes sense.

484
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,309
Advocacy's hard.

485
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:57,869
I mean, I remember a few mates ringing me up and saying, geez, I've just seen Terry McCrown's article about you.

486
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,190
He's...

487
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,130
Mentioned you 12 times and ripped shreds through you.

488
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:09,609
I mean, that I could handle because, you know, as Roz Kelly was saying to you in the past, it's not about you.

489
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,869
It's about the role you're playing.

490
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,329
But it's the divisive nature sometimes of advocacy and the conflict that I found really hard.

491
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:22,849
And so after six years of doing that, I just had that awareness that that wasn't me.

492
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,210
But...

493
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,509
What had you done to get Terry's attention 12 times?

494
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,849
I've got to ask that question.

495
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:38,690
Oh, look, we were pretty annoyed about some moves that were afoot to try and give extra coal.

496
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,150
Look, it's very complicated.

497
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,150
But extra coal to the Hazelwood Power Station, which was the most greenhouse...

498
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:47,670
Unfriendly.

499
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:53,170
...intensive power station in Australia by some measures.

500
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:54,890
What year are we talking here?

501
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,630
Oh, God, this is going back 2000.

502
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,009
2003, 2002, 2003.

503
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,069
You're ahead of your time.

504
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:06,470
Well, look, so we didn't want them to get extra coal.

505
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:14,710
I mean, I just couldn't see, though, in some respects that pushing the life of this power station out from 2028 to 2033,

506
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,589
I mean, surely we couldn't still be digging coal out of the ground then.

507
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,549
Surely this power station couldn't still be running.

508
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,329
But, you know, that's what was proposed.

509
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,069
Anyway, Terry obviously sees things from a different perspective.

510
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,289
Yeah, perspective, so pulled me to shreds.

511
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:39,890
But, look, there's a funny thing about that story because in my first year of going from volunteer to full-time at Fair Share,

512
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,329
I got a phone call from the Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation.

513
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,710
And they said, we've got a business that wants to make a donation to something similar to what you're doing,

514
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,029
and we want to put you forward.

515
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,710
And I said, oh, jeez, thank you.

516
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:52,690
That's, wow.

517
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,730
Yeah, it's $10,000, and that is a lot of money.

518
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,170
Back then, it was a lot of money for us.

519
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,970
And I said, oh, can I ask what the business is?

520
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,349
And they said, yeah, it's International Power.

521
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,890
They run the Hazelwood Power Station.

522
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,750
Of all the businesses it could have been, I took a deep breath and I thought about it.

523
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:17,710
I thought, no, we have to say yes to that funding because we're not an advocacy group.

524
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,869
We're not working on climate change at Fair Share.

525
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:24,230
Gee, do I say something about, yeah.

526
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,470
Look, can you just say that if you're putting us forward that I,

527
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,730
I'm not going to work with the charity?

528
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,450
I mean, as I said, we were a chef and a driver and me back then.

529
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:33,089
It was tiny.

530
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,990
But just mention that.

531
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:34,609
Oh, why is that?

532
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,549
They'll know.

533
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:36,309
Just mention it.

534
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:39,069
Anyway, we got the $10,000 a week later.

535
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,349
And of course, you ring up the head of corporate affairs at International Power and say,

536
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,450
thank you, because that's what you do.

537
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,890
And he answered the phone and laughed.

538
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,009
He laughed so hard.

539
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:56,430
He said, when the Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation recommended you but mentioned your name,

540
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,490
everybody in the office said, we can't give any funding to them.

541
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,069
You know what he was trying to shut down this power station.

542
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:03,930
We weren't.

543
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,289
But Jim Coots was his name.

544
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,809
And he said, no, because that was Marcus's role.

545
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,829
And he always did it really respectfully and professionally.

546
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,269
Yeah, he disagreed.

547
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,210
He would rather the Hazelwood Power Station have not been admitting what it did.

548
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,590
But he did it very respectfully.

549
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,070
And he's doing something now, which sounds fantastic.

550
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,590
So we are supporting them.

551
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,630
I love it.

552
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,070
And we've got a 14-year now history with that organisation.

553
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,710
Yes.

554
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:36,449
And that's, you know, it seems like a happier time, Marcus, where you could disagree but have respect,

555
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,650
you know, as opposed to what feels now, I don't agree with you, I want you cancelled.

556
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,570
I want you out and I'll try and run you out of town.

557
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,230
And I love hearing those stories because it feels like they need to come back.

558
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,710
You know, if you were disrespectful and a whole range of other things that had done things underhanded,

559
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,510
you probably didn't deserve the $10,000.

560
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:55,769
But it sounds like.

561
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,050
Your reputation was strong enough, even on the other side.

562
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,570
And I saw your leadership firsthand a moment ago.

563
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,230
You know, you walked through the kitchens as volunteers from everywhere and you introduced us.

564
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,670
That's Prue.

565
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,289
That's, you know, the warehouse guys.

566
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,710
Clearly you're hands-on enough to know who everyone is, which, again, is one of the great traits we see all the time.

567
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:14,250
Yeah.

568
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:21,510
I mean, just going back to that power company, it's ironic now that that company is now French-owned.

569
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,849
The French-based head office said we're pulling out of coal.

570
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,449
Despite how profitable that power station was for them.

571
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:35,829
And they're very heavily, it's a company called Engie, very heavily in renewable energy generation.

572
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,769
And it's a very different company.

573
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:44,070
But because of that ability to be able to work with them over these 14 years,

574
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,650
we find ourselves in an incredible partnership with the company.

575
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:52,929
So in some respects, you could have easily cancelled them, as you said, early on.

576
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:55,829
But just by working with them, we've done some incredible things.

577
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,769
We've done some incredible things together.

578
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,329
Yeah.

579
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:58,170
Thanks for sharing it.

580
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,989
It's a great story.

581
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:00,309
We talk about leaders.

582
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,150
And this question almost seems redundant with you.

583
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,389
How do you positively impact others in your environment?

584
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:08,829
That's what you do every second of your working life.

585
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,710
But clearly that's a huge part of you.

586
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:17,610
I mean, how have you gone about that for people listening in what you do day-to-day, positively impacting others?

587
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:24,050
Well, look, the obvious thing to talk about is improving the diets and the health of people who are doing it tough.

588
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,710
But it's the way we've done it.

589
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:38,550
And it's by spending time with people who've come forward and heard about us and want to participate and having a conversation with them.

590
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,750
And they're doing it in their own private capacity.

591
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:44,489
They're doing it through their family.

592
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,530
They're doing it through the business that they work for.

593
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:54,530
And exploring how you can work together around a common interest.

594
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:01,070
And so that's where I think why FairShare is so strong.

595
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,489
There's not a vulnerability to, for example, losing funding from one source.

596
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,610
Because there are so many people and organizations that have bought in.

597
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,489
And there's a real stickiness as well.

598
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:21,090
And quite often in philanthropy, just in that side of things, in Australia, there's a come and go.

599
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,369
And they'll support you for three years and then they'll go.

600
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:25,369
But there's something about...

601
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,510
There's something about how we've gone about things that have meant they've joined us and they've stuck.

602
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:34,869
Not necessarily forever, but for much longer than they would have with other organizations.

603
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,789
Why is that?

604
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,170
Is that because their people come and volunteer?

605
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,030
Is it because of your relationships?

606
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,289
Both of those things.

607
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,230
It's...

608
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,090
I once heard one of the most important things you can teach your children is how to say thank you.

609
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,690
And I think that in part comes from feeling generous.

610
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,449
Genuine gratitude.

611
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:01,949
So when somebody has actually supported us, geez, I'm grateful.

612
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,550
Because it empowers us.

613
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,550
And then it's how you say thank you, how you communicate your gratitude so that you're not just unprofessionally,

614
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:16,510
but people can hear it in your voice, whether it's an email or a letter or you're having that conversation.

615
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:20,889
It's about them trying to find a way to actually get them in here.

616
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:24,630
And like you've seen it today, to get them come in, have a tour through it,

617
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,730
to come in and even jump on the tools for an hour,

618
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:39,309
to find a way of the CEO of that business that supported us for years to come down with her two teenage daughters

619
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:44,449
to spend a night on the tools together because she's busy, but she wants to spend time with her kids.

620
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:50,230
And here's a way of ticking a work box, ticking a community box and doing something with her kids.

621
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:54,449
So it's one of the great things about Fair Share is that...

622
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,289
You can actually participate.

623
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:04,389
So I think people have stuck with us because they can be a part of it.

624
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,050
And yeah, I love it when groups come down.

625
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,949
The Laidlaws that were very much behind Collingwood and Hard Yakka.

626
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:15,110
Great family.

627
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,670
Fantastic family.

628
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:23,409
And so they have a family foundation that supported us.

629
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,929
They really backed our kitchen garden program.

630
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,489
And if I look at the next generation, John and Betty's children,

631
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:38,429
Mark's down here in the warehouse every Tuesday in his shorts and his work boots,

632
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:40,869
helping Ray down there move things around.

633
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,869
Michelle's been in here for years helping in the kitchen once a week.

634
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,650
And then I've got Melissa helping with some of our fundraising.

635
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,369
So the family's really engaged and I just loved it.

636
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,929
And I think if I could say a thing about the family,

637
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,530
when we had two generations,

638
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,349
so the second and the third generation in the kitchen a couple of weeks ago,

639
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:03,989
on the tools for a night.

640
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:06,070
So it was a way for that family to come together,

641
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,349
spend time in Fair Share, a charity they support,

642
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,150
and then go out to dinner afterwards.

643
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,449
So, geez, if you've got that connection, it certainly helps.

644
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:19,389
You don't take it for granted and you work hard to keep it.

645
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:20,889
I think that helps.

646
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,309
Amazing family story, isn't it?

647
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,309
It's a really successful family.

648
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:31,010
that find the time to get on the tools, not just give money and feel good about it. I love that

649
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:37,710
story. We see leaders very conscious, the leaders that we're speaking to around how they create and

650
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,610
share their vision. You sent me some information before I caught up with you today about mission

651
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,389
clarity and the not-for-profit space. It feels like you've got a real sense of what the mission

652
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:53,130
is and sticking to it. Can you share that with us? Yeah. Look, it's interesting as this

653
00:40:53,130 --> 00:41:00,489
food relief sector has evolved and matured over the last couple of decades.

654
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,309
There are some great organizations and some fantastic people doing good work. But I think what

655
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:18,489
for me, we needed to find was our niche in that. And for us, it wasn't too difficult. It was around

656
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:23,110
the cooking bit. And so therefore, if I look at food,

657
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,769
and Oz Harvest and Second Bite and Fair Share, all of us work with businesses that have surplus

658
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:36,889
food. All of us give food to frontline charities, but only one of us cooks on a scale. And so more

659
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:42,010
and more, we're having conversations with those other organizations at a strategic level, at an

660
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:49,769
operational level around Fair Share honing its operations to just that cooking bit. So it means

661
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:53,070
that Ingham's Chicken can approach Second Bite.

662
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,670
And so we've got probably two to three pallets of chicken breast and Maryland with a day or two

663
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,289
left on it, a week that we can donate to you, but it can't be frozen and it must be cooked

664
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:09,349
before it's given to a charity. And Second Bite, obviously knowing the value of that chicken,

665
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:15,010
it's tasty, it's nutritious, wants to do something with it. But the only way they can comply with that

666
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:20,030
requirement of Ingham's is by passing it through Fair Share. So they said, yes,

667
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,869
they brought Ingham's down here. Ingham's had their

668
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,849
checklist, their notebook, and they looked at our procedures and our facilities and our staff

669
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,849
and said, right, you can have this chicken as long as it passes through Fair Share.

670
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:38,969
So this is where that mission is really narrowing to the cooking bit. So let Second Bite work with

671
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:45,869
Ingham's, steward that relationship, collect, bring the chicken to us, we'll cook it. But before that

672
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:52,570
van of theirs backs out, load it up with three pallets of Fair Share meals and take it out to

673
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,110
the local charity.

674
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,909
When you're taking out the fruit and veg, you're giving them as well. So they've got chicken

675
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:01,010
casserole, chicken curry, and a whole lot of chicken-based dishes as well. We're not cooking

676
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:07,570
it in a couple of minutes, but what we cooked the day before. And so that's where we've got

677
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:13,489
our biggest facility up in Brisbane. And it's there because there's so much surplus food in

678
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:18,030
Queensland that Foodbank gets offered it. The only solution to them is for it to be cooked.

679
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,030
And to Foodbank's credit, they looked at it and said, well, cooking isn't our,

680
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,909
that's not our expertise. We're warehouses, we're logistics. But gee, that group down at

681
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:34,690
Fair Share could come and set up up here and we could bookend them. We'll bring the food to them,

682
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:39,230
they can cook it, and we'll distribute the meals they cook. And so we've got Australia's biggest

683
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,969
charity kitchen up in Brisbane, and we've been working with Foodbank in that way for five years,

684
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:48,690
and it just makes sense. And it was funny going to a few philanthropists and they said,

685
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,809
yeah, we've supported Foodbank before. We've given grants to Second Bite, we've backed,

686
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,329
Oz Harvest, and we thought we'd done food relief. But what's so unique about this is that you've

687
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:03,889
teamed up here and you're working with respective strengths of charities, not competing because we

688
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:08,449
see so much competition, but actually collaborating around your respective strengths.

689
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,429
So it's a great story. I'll come back to that collaboration in a moment because I love that

690
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,409
you're doing it. As you said, there's so much overlap in the charitable space and therefore

691
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:22,650
lots of wastage, which is the opposite of what you do, your reverse wastage. Curiosity is a term

692
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:22,929
that we...

693
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,670
Attribute a lot to leaders. They're very curious about how they can self-improve and

694
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,469
they approach their learning and development through it. Does that resonate with you,

695
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,309
the idea of curiosity?

696
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:34,969
Yeah, I'm not particularly curious though.

697
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,500
And I've heard that a lot as well, you know, from people that just

698
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,960
quite know themselves well enough to know that that's just not their thing.

699
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:53,420
It's not. I wish I was. I'm not. But gee, I know somebody who is, and I've worked with her for so

700
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,420
well for so many years.

701
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,760
So that's part of what you said about surrounding yourself with people who compliment you.

702
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,659
Yeah. And so her happy spot is at home after dinner with a glass of red wine on the internet,

703
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,380
looking at, I wonder how they do that over there. Oh, gee, I've heard about this model

704
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,940
and coming to work with, I've got this idea or I've seen this being done. And

705
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,579
that's why I value you so much, Kelly, because you've got that curious mind that I don't.

706
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,980
You need it in an organisation, but not everybody needs to be that way. And we've got Kelly.

707
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,760
And it's brilliant, isn't it? That idea of complementary skills and shared values makes

708
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,599
enormous amount of sense. Communicating with clarity is a common dimension of leadership.

709
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,579
And clearly to have those long-term partnerships that you have and saying thank you and being

710
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:44,099
grateful to those relationships, clearly you've got a really strong communication

711
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,360
bent to how you lead. How would you describe it?

712
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,539
Very simple. As a bachelor living brand, one of,

713
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,860
the most wonderful relationships in my life is a friend, Michael Magazzanich, who was in the media

714
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,760
for many years. And for years, he drilled me in keeping things very simple and rewriting

715
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,539
things I'd written. And it culminated for me in a board meeting one day where Philip Brass,

716
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:18,679
just a great Australian, who has been a wonderful, yeah, a bit of a guiding light for me over the

717
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,420
years in a quiet way. He was on our board for 12 years. And he once commented in a board meeting,

718
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,360
Marcus, your writing is very simple. I didn't know how to take that. I thought,

719
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,119
is that a criticism or a compliment? But I reflect on Michael's coaching of me to write

720
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:44,820
in very simple English and talk in very basic ways. Because in the case of FairShare,

721
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,460
it's not particularly complicated. And when I'm writing a grant application or a report to a

722
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,980
funder or something, it's keeping it simple. I think that makes it accessible.

723
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,159
Let what you're doing speak for itself rather than trying to dress it up into something it

724
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,000
might not be or to make it sound really smart. So I've seen a few consultants' reports where

725
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,900
some big firms have done some work for us pro bono. And I look at the language and thought,

726
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,119
jeez, I could never write this. But I'm not trying to either. So I think, I mean, for us in this

727
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,599
space, it's what's the need? What is the organisation doing about it? What's different about it?

728
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:23,840
And

729
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,800
I think with communication in the not-for-profit space as well,

730
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,659
you've got to inject a bit of yourself into it. So what's your story? Why are you doing this?

731
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,840
And talking about your journey a bit, I believe that's important. Not everybody agrees with me

732
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:49,000
on that one. And I think also then impact as well. So those things, I think, are critical.

733
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,639
And I think we do that pretty well. We're not out there

734
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:59,699
in the public limelight enough, but I think that when people see us

735
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,460
and whether it's in what we post on our social media channels

736
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,659
and our newsletters, it's communicated pretty clearly and plainly

737
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:09,400
and it's accessible.

738
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,539
Scott Pope, the barefoot investor who spoke,

739
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,860
he sold more books than anyone in Australia, Scotty Pope,

740
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,199
and people say to him, it's such simple writing, it's so easy,

741
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:19,719
anyone could do it.

742
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,920
And there's genius.

743
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,820
Yeah, if anyone could, you'd sell however many million books paid

744
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,099
for your soul now, but the simplicity in the language

745
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:32,099
and the genius in making something, finance that bamboozles a lot of us

746
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:37,360
as simple as he did, it sounds like you've got a very similar understanding

747
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,239
of how to communicate.

748
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,940
I want to come back because it seems to be a big challenge

749
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,320
in the not-for-profit and the charity space is that too many people

750
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,039
doing the same thing or trying to do the same thing

751
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:48,340
with limited resources.

752
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,539
You're incredibly open about that.

753
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,739
You mentioned OzHarvest and Foodbank and SecondBite.

754
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,480
To find that collaboration, how important are those collaborations to you?

755
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,800
Because we see that leaders are really now understanding

756
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,659
that that's where a lot of strength lies.

757
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,800
Look, absolutely, we can have so much more impact

758
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,300
and we can use finite resources available to us so much more efficiently

759
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,800
if we are collaborating.

760
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:17,320
Look, it's not all kumbaya.

761
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:20,619
There's still some pretty dysfunctional collaboration happening

762
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:21,139
in our sector.

763
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:22,179
It does my head in.

764
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,880
It really annoys me.

765
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,360
But I think with collaboration, you work with those people

766
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:38,340
and organisations where you have common values and a common mission

767
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,679
and a genuine appetite for collaboration.

768
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,239
It's not everywhere.

769
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,119
And I've found over the years that at times with organisations,

770
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,599
the leadership has been very competitive of other organisations.

771
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,780
And then you get a change of leadership and all of a sudden it flips.

772
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,780
And for me, it's flipped both ways.

773
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,159
It's gone from being highly collaborative to being just the door shut

774
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,500
to being really competitive and then opening up in wonderful collaborations.

775
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,760
So, so much it depends on the leadership of other organisations

776
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,980
as to whether you can collaborate with them or not.

777
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,099
And I think that in our space, it's going to be really interesting

778
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:19,500
to see where we're at in five or ten years' time because you, yeah,

779
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,579
yeah, there's a lot of collaboration.

780
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,260
Who knows where that collaboration goes?

781
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,380
Yeah, you can bring a lot of things together to make things more efficient.

782
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,480
But at the same time, you know, mergers aren't the answer to everything.

783
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,500
We have the title of this is Empowering Leadership

784
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,780
and yours is an incredible story of leadership.

785
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,099
In that spirit, who has been the greatest leader in your life?

786
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,199
Oh, goodness.

787
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,360
There have been a few.

788
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,849
I think one of the people who,

789
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:56,429
I've found most inspiring over the years is the person who's succeeding me

790
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,710
in the CEO role at Fairshare.

791
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:07,190
I think we talked about self-awareness before and, yeah, from, I mean,

792
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,369
I know I'm a mobiliser.

793
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:12,769
I love engaging people externally and bringing them into Fairshare

794
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,349
and having them be part of what we do.

795
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,889
I've been lucky to have people join and stay.

796
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:23,210
And we've got a really strong team operationally.

797
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:26,030
And as our long-term president, David Harris, says,

798
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,130
you're lucky because you can just hamble blindly over your shoulder

799
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:36,429
and know that Kelly or any one of a number of people will catch that and run with it.

800
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:37,650
You don't need to look over your shoulder.

801
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:42,349
But, look, Fairshare's now around 70 staff,

802
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,329
the equivalent of about 45 full-time,

803
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:48,829
and internal leadership's as important as external leadership.

804
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:50,829
And it's...

805
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,550
It's not a space that I play naturally in.

806
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,150
And I looked at it and thought, gee,

807
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,949
I could train myself to do that differently, to do it better.

808
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,090
I could spend time on it.

809
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:06,070
And then somebody became available.

810
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:10,630
And I'm speaking about Paul Conroy, who's taken over from me.

811
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:11,929
And I thought, gee,

812
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:16,050
the team will be so much stronger if he played at CEO than if I did.

813
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,929
And you'd look at this in your footy career

814
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,369
and somebody would come along and over a few years you'd think,

815
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:20,590
yeah,

816
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:20,889
that'd be a good thing.

817
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,650
And if I play better in that position

818
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,530
than the person we've played there for five years,

819
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,489
the team will be stronger, so we're changing it.

820
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,210
And that's how I've looked at this.

821
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,309
Lucky enough to have Paul come in.

822
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,329
And from day one, even though he said, I'll come in as COO,

823
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,829
he acted like he was CEO, which is exactly what I wanted.

824
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,429
And it's what the organisation needed.

825
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:44,849
And internally, the staff responded so positively to it.

826
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,349
And I just watch him with awe.

827
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:50,869
He's exactly what the organisation needs.

828
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:53,070
He's exactly what the organisation needed to be, FairShare 2.0.

829
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:56,070
And it was a funny one because a number of people have said to me,

830
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:00,170
but FairShare was stronger than it ever had been.

831
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,090
It was doing more important work and doing it so well.

832
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:04,909
And you've changed it.

833
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,809
And there's a risk there.

834
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:10,449
And I think one of the things for us is you don't want to throw the baby out

835
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:11,889
with the bathwater.

836
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,530
There was a real magic there.

837
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,429
I don't know why, but it was something.

838
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,909
But you don't want to lose that.

839
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:20,849
But to see,

840
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:24,269
to see how Paul's now leading the organisation, it's wow.

841
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:27,829
And I've never worked with somebody who I've had as much respect.

842
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,230
Not easy, but I just see the organisation even stronger for that.

843
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:36,849
And that takes incredible self-awareness and self-reflection.

844
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:41,929
Most people in the past, to give up that title, to give up the hierarchy,

845
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,929
I know you shrug and you think, you know, that isn't important to you,

846
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,929
which again is reflective of the type of leadership we're loving sharing

847
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:50,869
and those stories we're loving.

848
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:55,090
If I can find someone to do that role better, you know, that makes sense,

849
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,130
but you still have to be, you know,

850
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:01,070
in touch with your ego and a range of other things to make that happen.

851
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:05,130
We've got a wonderful guy who's just about to step onto our board.

852
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:09,989
And he's, I'm not going to say who it is, but really impressive guy.

853
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,929
And he said to me, Marcus, I've watched over the years, many founders,

854
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,409
and I didn't start Fair Share, got involved very early on, but didn't start it.

855
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:20,409
He said many founders haven't got the self-awareness,

856
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,530
when an organisation that's successful and gets to a point,

857
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,730
to know that it needs something else.

858
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:29,550
And even if they do have the self-awareness,

859
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,409
they can't necessarily step away from that role.

860
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:36,789
And to me, leadership is not about a title.

861
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,769
So I see myself in the leadership role at Fair Share.

862
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,210
That's not to undermine Paul's role as CEO,

863
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,769
but we've got a wonderful partnership.

864
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,110
We bring different things to the organisation.

865
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:50,210
And,

866
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:53,349
and I think that just makes Fair Share stronger.

867
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:58,190
And I know that I can have even more impact now without being CEO.

868
00:54:58,449 --> 00:54:59,590
And that might sound a bit odd,

869
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,909
but I think we're going to have so much more impact through him in that role.

870
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:06,409
And so it's, it's about this, how you,

871
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,989
how you play the team to have the most impact.

872
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:09,409
Yeah.

873
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:09,690
Yeah.

874
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:10,809
It makes sense.

875
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,130
Easier said than done for a lot of,

876
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,150
I'm thinking of Andrew Bassett,

877
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,050
the founder of Seek, who I interviewed on this podcast.

878
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,150
And, you know, incredibly humble, incredibly successful Seek.

879
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:20,750
He's a $10 billion.

880
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:22,289
A company by market cap.

881
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:25,489
And the thing he wanted to speak about most that he felt was the best thing he'd ever done

882
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,190
was replace himself as CEO in the,

883
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,969
in the past 18 months.

884
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:29,269
And,

885
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:31,010
and he spoke the same language as you,

886
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:31,630
that humility.

887
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:33,050
It's Ian Narev,

888
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,530
who's the former CEO of the Commonwealth Bank.

889
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,809
He can do things that I couldn't do.

890
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:36,050
He,

891
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,969
he does it better than I could ever do,

892
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,150
which for people who've had great success,

893
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,130
it takes great humility to,

894
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,090
to understand that.

895
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,610
We love the idea of collaboration in current leadership.

896
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,050
And the sense that,

897
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,670
that is where a lot of sweet spots lie.

898
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:50,849
If you,

899
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,670
if you could collaborate with anyone on anything,

900
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,030
I'm assuming fair share is where we're going to go with this.

901
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,670
Has there been a partner?

902
00:55:56,949 --> 00:55:57,170
I mean,

903
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,969
you,

904
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:02,869
you casually connect with incredible leaders all around the country.

905
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,869
Has there been one collaboration that you thought of?

906
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:05,170
I could,

907
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,429
could get that going.

908
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,409
That would make a difference.

909
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:07,869
Yeah.

910
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:08,190
Look,

911
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:14,150
the pandemic's been a real opportunity for us to rethink how we,

912
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:17,610
I'm going to say staff the kitchen.

913
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:18,610
So,

914
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:19,610
before,

915
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:21,570
before the pandemic,

916
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,769
we had one and a half thousand regular volunteers.

917
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,690
We had the same number on the waiting list.

918
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:26,730
It was easy.

919
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:32,650
One person retired and a friend of theirs had heard about it and they stepped in and it was just,

920
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:33,710
you know,

921
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,369
it was easy.

922
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:41,250
Volunteering is not returning to charities in the numbers that they were pre-pandemic,

923
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,889
which is harder for the charitable sector.

924
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:50,730
And that's an opportunity for us because it means that we can look at how we can diversify our volunteering.

925
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,250
So,

926
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:51,650
and,

927
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,389
and Paul's really leading this and I so agree with it.

928
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,650
So can we have more ethnic diversity in the kitchen,

929
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:01,469
volunteering on our kitchen gardens,

930
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:02,929
driving our vans?

931
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,989
Can we have younger people?

932
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,389
So people maybe not staying with us for 15 years as volunteers,

933
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,570
maybe for three years while they're at university.

934
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:19,510
Can we have people who are recipients of our meals coming in and helping as well?

935
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:20,650
And long,

936
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,849
I haven't answered your question,

937
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:26,869
but I think that last bit is where I'm interested in going.

938
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:33,329
And my mother was an academic up at Melbourne university and did a lot of work with in Arnhem Land.

939
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,809
And a few years ago she said,

940
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:41,090
we've got a group of indigenous kids coming down to Melbourne for a week.

941
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,969
And could they come down and spend half a day in the fair share kitchen?

942
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:48,829
And I pushed her on and said,

943
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:49,090
well,

944
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:49,889
look,

945
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:50,170
the,

946
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,670
the staff and volunteers would love that,

947
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,329
but why?

948
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:58,929
And they want to go to the MCG and they were going there.

949
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,050
She said,

950
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,929
because they've got tough lives.

951
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:04,090
Yeah,

952
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,530
there's no hiding that,

953
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,809
but there are others in Australia that are doing it tough as well.

954
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:08,849
And I want them to say that,

955
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,929
and I want them to be part of something that's helping others who are doing it tough.

956
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,250
I think there'd be a really,

957
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:17,329
it'd be a really interesting experience for them.

958
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:17,949
Anyway,

959
00:58:17,949 --> 00:58:18,369
we did it.

960
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,170
The staff loved it.

961
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:19,949
The volunteers thought it was great.

962
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:24,449
The kids left and I was speaking to mum a few days later and I said,

963
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:25,329
how did that,

964
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:26,070
how did that go?

965
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:26,789
And she said,

966
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:28,409
bar none,

967
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,650
the best experience they had in Melbourne was volunteering at fair share.

968
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:32,530
Wow.

969
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:32,809
I said,

970
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,829
I don't believe that it would have been going to the MCG,

971
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,670
but she said,

972
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:36,909
no,

973
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:37,610
it was,

974
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,289
it was exactly what I wanted.

975
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:48,949
And so I've reflected on that and to be able to take some people who yeah,

976
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:49,909
are doing it tough.

977
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:54,090
And who have received or are receiving our meals and getting them in,

978
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:57,949
I think would be very empowering because if you think about it,

979
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:05,090
it's pretty challenging having to ask for and receiving a meal when you're doing it tough.

980
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:06,650
There's a real,

981
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,869
there's a power imbalance.

982
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:09,309
There's a dignity thing there,

983
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:11,869
a dignity challenge for us as a giver.

984
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:19,309
And if you can then give people the opportunity to then be part of helping others,

985
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:19,889
it's not a pain,

986
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:20,489
back thing.

987
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:21,090
It's just,

988
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,190
I think that's a very empowering thing.

989
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,929
And a beautiful moment for me one day in a fair share was a school group walking into the kitchen.

990
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:30,289
They'd been inducted,

991
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:31,170
they'd washed their hands,

992
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:35,650
they're putting on their aprons and a young secondary school girl just pulled me aside and said,

993
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:39,449
thanks for doing what you do and for the opportunity to come in today.

994
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:40,670
Um,

995
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,989
our family received some fair share meals when we were doing a tough a few years ago.

996
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:47,909
So it's really special for me now coming in and being able to help somebody else.

997
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,110
Amazing.

998
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,210
An incredible note to,

999
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:51,489
uh,

1000
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:52,190
to finish on,

1001
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,530
uh,

1002
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:52,909
Marcus,

1003
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:53,489
um,

1004
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,130
congratulations,

1005
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:54,670
uh,

1006
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:56,889
on the wonderful work that you do and the contribution you make.

1007
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:57,570
It's inspiring.

1008
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:57,849
And,

1009
00:59:58,269 --> 00:59:58,630
um,

1010
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:01,050
I love the opportunity to sort of walk through today and,

1011
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:01,250
uh,

1012
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,889
see it firsthand and understand the impact that you're having every single day.

1013
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:07,190
It's a great leadership story and I appreciate you sharing with me.

1014
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:07,530
Well,

1015
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,510
you talk about walking,

1016
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:08,809
Luke,

1017
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,570
um,

1018
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:13,110
we've got our chefs walking about 10 kilometers a day in the kitchen.

1019
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:14,690
So what we do is we mobilize,

1020
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,670
um,

1021
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,829
our supporter base to walk for fair share and fundraise for fair share every October.

1022
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:19,869
Um,

1023
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,250
so they set themselves goals over two weeks.

1024
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:23,409
Um,

1025
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:23,969
we,

1026
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,449
uh,

1027
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:29,070
we're going to walk a hundred kilometers or 150 kilometers and get them to get their friends behind fair share.

1028
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,809
So my challenge is to you,

1029
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:32,889
will you walk a hundred kilometers in,

1030
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,829
uh,

1031
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:36,769
October for fair share over a couple of weeks and rally your community?

1032
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:37,510
Sign me up,

1033
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:37,829
Marcus.

1034
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,050
And in any way I can,

1035
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:39,690
uh,

1036
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,210
contribute,

1037
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:40,869
I'd love to,

1038
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:41,150
uh,

1039
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,090
to be part of,

1040
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,969
it's pretty close to home,

1041
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,369
uh,

1042
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,170
for me and,

1043
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,510
very small thing to walk for,

1044
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:46,730
uh,

1045
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,809
for a great cause like yours.

1046
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:48,610
So sign me up,

1047
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,750
hold me to account on that.

1048
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,969
One,

1049
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:52,329
that's a pretty big effort for the chefs every day.

1050
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:52,610
That's,

1051
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,690
that's the scale of your kitchens,

1052
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:54,110
isn't it?

1053
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:55,610
I've got to taste a lot of food.

1054
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,329
So the calorie,

1055
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:57,929
calorie intake's probably a bit high.

1056
01:00:58,949 --> 01:00:59,570
Thanks again,

1057
01:00:59,610 --> 01:00:59,750
mate.

1058
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:00,230
Great to see you.

1059
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:00,889
Absolute pleasure.

01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,420
