1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,820
My conversation today is with Mark Bunn.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,220
Mark's expertise and passion is in creating a shift in our thinking about health, happiness,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,440
high performance, and higher consciousness.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,320
In this conversation today, we discuss how ancient wisdom can help us with modern health,

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:27,079
the way that Mother Nature can assist us in leading a happier, healthier way of life,

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,039
and how when we focus on our intuition and gut wisdom, it often leads to a better and

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:32,719
happier life.

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,820
Mark Bunn is an inspirational modern leader in my mind, and his use of ancient techniques

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,880
to help people with a better life is a really remarkable story.

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,659
His passion for what he does is one of the fundamentals for the work that we do in our

11
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,619
leadership business, Alita.

21
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,709
before moving on to become one of the world's most sought-after experts in Ayurvedic medicine,

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,870
a tradition with thousands of years of history in the East.

23
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,450
Mark's book, Ancient Wisdom for Modern Health,

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,590
is a three-time Nobel Prize winner.

25
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,549
and a brilliant guide for anyone wanting to live a simpler, healthier, and happier

26
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,010
life.

27
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:49,650
Marty, it's always good to see you, mate.

28
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,469
That's likewise.

29
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,549
Now, you're uniquely placed in my mind as an expert with roots in the East and the West,

30
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,790
and this is a pretty big question off the top, but given you've written books about

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,530
it and you write extensively on this topic, but in your mind, if you could sum it up,

32
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:10,009
what are the keys, if you could break it down in any way you want, to living a healthy and

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,610
happy, successful life?

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,509
The one-word answer would be simplicity.

35
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,189
My travels, Southeast Asia, I'm sure many of the listeners, you go to these, I'm putting

36
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,469
air marks up here, inverted commas, third world countries, you know, a bit sort of backward

37
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:31,229
or simple, but they live a very healthy, happy life, predominantly, and it's just basically

38
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:36,349
a connection to nature, would be the second piece of it, that really nature has certain

39
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,550
laws.

40
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,590
There's a wisdom to life, an intelligence that runs our universe.

41
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,509
And we humans are a part of that intelligence, and there's certain laws that Mother Nature

42
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:51,349
uses to guide us as to how to live that healthy, happy life.

43
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:58,990
I don't know why I've got avatar in my mind, because that's a sort of low-rented answer

44
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,069
I can give you back, but I did go and see the recent version of it, which has got links

45
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,590
into that, but there's so many connections that I have with you, and I want to talk to

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,550
you about a health retreat.

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,949
In Bali, I have a health retreat, and I'll ask you about that, but that's what I enjoy.

48
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,110
You walk out of the door there, you walk into the village, the smiles and the laughter and

49
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,710
the happiness for that generation, that group of people are so connected to everything that

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,349
you just spoke about, and we get back in the West and get crazy and take on so many things

51
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,449
and develop this stressful life.

52
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,990
I mean, I still find, even with knowledge and understanding and a desire, I still find

53
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,370
it hard to make healthy choices all the time.

54
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,469
What's the key to doing that in your mind?

55
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,789
Well, we should differentiate between simple and easy, because I'm nodding my head, I'm

56
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:50,789
exactly the same.

57
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:55,310
I can't do all the stuff we're going to talk about in the next half an hour, hour, myself.

58
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,310
It's a challenge.

59
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,229
And so the wisdom, this is the important, the understanding and the wisdom of what we

60
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,349
need to be a healthy individual is very simple.

61
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,650
It's been around for thousands and thousands and thousands of years, Ayurvedic medicine,

62
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,810
traditional Chinese medicine, indigenous cultures.

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,810
They've known it for thousands of years.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:10,930
Yeah.

65
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,030
Yeah.

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,129
Yeah.

67
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:11,229
Yeah.

68
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:11,330
Yeah.

69
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,349
Yeah.

70
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:11,710
They've known it forever.

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,689
Our Western culture, and particularly the way we've structured our working lives, makes

72
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:21,410
it difficult to implement some of these simple wisdoms.

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,670
So again, coming back to that sort of philosophy we're going with simplicity is just start

74
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,149
small.

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,610
You know, don't try and turn your life upside down from the end of this recording.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:40,209
You know, just take one or two simple principles and implement them slowly over time until

77
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,050
they become a habit.

78
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,870
And then take on the next one.

79
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,050
So just what resonates and we have this, this, we'll get to it probably throughout the session,

80
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,550
but this, this gut wisdom, you know, which we don't often pay attention to in the West,

81
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,449
you know, it's all about the what's on the app or what the experts telling me, but our

82
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,449
bodies according to Ayurveda are infinitely intelligent and they're telling us in every

83
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,589
moment exactly what we need to eat to nourish ourselves, what relationships nourish us,

84
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,129
what work nourishes us, but we just don't listen to it.

85
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,629
So just pick that little, that little insight that's sort of welling up inside us.

86
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,089
And this is the thing I need to focus on, do that well, and then move on to the other

87
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:20,870
stuff later on.

88
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,430
And that is fascinating to me that you went there around the intuition.

89
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,310
So many of the different people I've spoken to on this podcast reference that all the

90
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,389
time when they really have made great life decisions.

91
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,689
It's based on that inner knowing.

92
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,870
And when they've likewise had decisions they'd regret, it was something telling him it didn't

93
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,089
quite feel right, but they overrode it because.

94
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,990
I think I can make this where I certainly relate to that and, and, you know, going back

95
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,449
into that, that sense of when it feels right intuitively, you think you're generally going

96
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,449
to make a good decision.

97
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,009
Is that, is that how you'd frame it?

98
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,009
Absolutely.

99
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,009
Yeah.

100
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,009
Well, one of the things I've really loved about this whole research into the Eastern

101
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,689
cultures is, is this reframing of life in the, in the West or the modern world, I should

102
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,750
say probably more than the West is we often see life as hard, you know, it's difficult.

103
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,750
It's a challenge.

104
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750
We've got to work hard.

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,750
You need sort of willpower.

106
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,550
Whereas in the East, they see it more as a flow.

107
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,410
We had this analogy of, of nature's intelligence and the analogy I use is, is like a surfer.

108
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,870
You've got a wave on the ocean, a surfer who understands that there's a certain time to

109
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,550
catch that wave, enjoys it.

110
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,870
It's absolutely exhilarating time of their life.

111
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,269
They're having a ball.

112
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,810
Nature's doing all the work and the surf is just enjoying the ride.

113
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,990
Now, Darce, I don't know about you, but when I go surfing, I'm usually paddling out when

114
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,750
the.

115
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,870
The waves crashing down on top of my head, you know, so I get the timing wrong.

116
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,569
I don't understand the laws of nature about surfing.

117
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:47,870
So for me, it's bloody hard work.

118
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,250
It's a mouthful of water and I'm never, never doing this stupid sport again.

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,829
So life is exactly the same.

120
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,850
The ancient rishis, they're called in the Ayurvedic tradition, they're the sages.

121
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,329
Rishi means a seer who can actually see or cognize those laws of nature that structure

122
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,990
life.

123
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,550
Tell us if we can turn our life around, we move our surfboard around a few degrees or

124
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,550
180 and we actually start going with the currents.

125
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,370
That flow, that intelligence, that life is very easy.

126
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,990
It just, it's just the way it's meant to be.

127
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,470
And so this is a, this, I think is the real sort of turnaround or thing we want to keep

128
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,470
in our awareness.

129
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,430
And Ayurveda itself means science of life.

130
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,430
You correct me here.

131
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:35,089
Anytime, you know, 6,000 plus years of history, longest, oldest living known health system

132
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,089
in the world.

133
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,089
And I want to.

134
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,089
Can I just jump in?

135
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,089
Yeah, sorry.

136
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,089
It absolutely means that.

137
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:45,589
You know, people leave Ayurveda at that they see it as this 6,000 year old, you know, books

138
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:50,250
that sit up on the, in the library shelf and it's called defined as the science of life.

139
00:07:50,250 --> 00:08:00,389
But really what Ayurveda is, is knowledge of those fundamental laws of nature that govern

140
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:01,389
life.

141
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:08,209
So if you wanted a manuscript, a guidebook, like a constitutional Bible of how to live

142
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,209
life.

143
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,050
Ayurveda.

144
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,089
Yeah.

145
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,470
Has all those fundamental laws.

146
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,709
So practically buddy, you know, people hear that and say, okay, that, that still sounds

147
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,709
a bit esoteric.

148
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:20,250
And how do I practically make that work?

149
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,970
And I can, I've got intuition.

150
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,470
My intuition feels like a donut.

151
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,470
Yep.

152
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,089
Is that a good choice, Mark?

153
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,790
And that will be complex.

154
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,809
So can you break that down more simply because the, you know, the West makes life so complicated

155
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,389
around coffee's good, coffee's bad.

156
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,389
We're going to have a paleo diet one week.

157
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,389
Yeah.

158
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,389
And a keto diet the next and vegetarian versus meat.

159
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,149
I mean, you know, I have experienced a fair bit of Ayurveda over a long period of time.

160
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:51,389
All of it intuitively makes perfect sense, but for someone listening to start, what does

161
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,389
it look like?

162
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:53,389
Yeah.

163
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:54,389
Beautiful question.

164
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,389
I've actually just come from doing a talk in a town to a group of graduates at an accounting

165
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,389
firm.

166
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,990
So all in their early twenties, just about to start their career.

167
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,389
And I was brought in to sort of give them tools on how they could sort of manage the,

168
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:08,389
not get burned out and resilience.

169
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:14,389
And so one of the key planks we discussed was connection to nature.

170
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,389
And so we use this term nature a lot.

171
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,889
So how do we practically do it?

172
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:24,389
Well, when you get up in the morning, going outside and just one morning, get up really

173
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,389
early and just greeting the early morning sun and do you feel better?

174
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:32,389
You know, is that sort of just that feeling of, Hey, this getting this natural light through

175
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,389
my eyes, does my mood lift or does it get depressed in the middle of the day?

176
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,389
You know, do I feel hungry?

177
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,889
In Ayurveda, the theory is that in the middle of the day, the sun is at its strongest and

178
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,690
also our inner sun, the Agni, the digestive fire is at our strongest.

179
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,090
So get a feel for if I haven't eaten a huge breakfast, do I feel hungry in the middle

180
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,090
of the day?

181
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,909
At the end of the day, you know, do I finish work and go out and walk down near the beach

182
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,549
if I live near the beach or a lake?

183
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,789
And does that connection to nature, does it make me feel calmer, more relaxed?

184
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,389
And everyone reports, yes.

185
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,389
You know what?

186
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,389
I spend time in nature.

187
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,190
I just, I feel better.

188
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,250
And so the science is now coming up of before it did, it's just that was the intuitive sort

189
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,210
of feeling we get.

190
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,990
At the end of the day, if I eat a really big meal at eight o'clock at night, you know,

191
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,289
I eat the steak and three veg and you would like some dessert with that, Das, I'd love

192
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:28,730
to, you know, it'd be rude not to have some dessert and we fill our belly up, do we feel

193
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,889
good when we go to sleep and do we wake up refreshed and perky early in the morning?

194
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,389
Or when we have a sort of lighter meal at night, do we sleep better and wake up fresher?

195
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:44,009
So these are the sort of starting things, this idea of that nature is out there, that

196
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:49,429
we see nature, we see the sunrise, we see sort of darkness descending at night.

197
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,950
Just this first step is to understand we're actually connected to that.

198
00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:02,389
That cycle of the sun through the day mirrors 100% one to one, the cycles of our inner physiology.

199
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,190
And so these types of things are good ways to sort of get our teeth into connecting to

200
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,190
these rhythms.

201
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,110
And I can't help but jump into that point as well, because it has got in my mind, incredibly

202
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,470
pear-shaped here in the West for want of a better term, where we now fear the sun and

203
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,409
you drive past the primary school and we understand why, we live in a, you know, in a country

204
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:27,649
that has got, you know, extreme heat at times, but you know, middle of winter, kids are wearing

205
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,870
the full brim hats, that beautiful winter sun that makes you feel good and you want

206
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,870
to enjoy it.

207
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,809
We've been told, you know, there's no time that sunsets.

208
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:37,190
Yeah.

209
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,429
That's, that's good for you to, to, to be in the sun and.

210
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,429
Yeah.

211
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,450
It's like a lot of things in, in our modern life, we go a little bit to the extremes.

212
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,250
And so traditionally Ayurveda, many ancient cultures, the sun was esteemed as the most

213
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,389
health giving, life giving, energy promoting thing on the planet.

214
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,370
In fact, even biochemically, physiologically, we can't live without the sun.

215
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,269
The sun's the most important thing to human life.

216
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,809
And all of that, you know, anything I've ever heard in this space from, from, you know,

217
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:13,809
the ancient wisdom of, of Ayurveda or other cultures intuitively makes perfect sense.

218
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:14,809
Yeah.

219
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:15,809
And everyone can relate to that.

220
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:20,210
Getting up on holiday in the morning, seeing the sunrise, being out in nature, the, the,

221
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:26,090
the energy and the happiness, it just flows from that state and trying to recreate it,

222
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,570
you know, is, is something that, you know, I'm really passionate about and it's, it's

223
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,570
what you do day to day.

224
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,350
You know, I mentioned earlier Sukhavati Bali and Ayurveda health retreat, very fortunate

225
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,429
enough to be there.

226
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:36,690
Yeah.

227
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,070
To be a founder and partner of 11 years ago, and I would describe being attached to that

228
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,690
money as completely transformative for my and my family's health.

229
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,289
And I think if I look to the sort of Western system here in Australia, we're allegedly

230
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:54,690
got the best health system in the world here in Australia, but there's more obesity, depression,

231
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,789
you know, you think of all of the cancers and autoimmune diseases and, you know, we're

232
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:05,690
drowning in heart disease and anxiety and other challenges in what is supposed to be

233
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,690
world's best practice.

234
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,649
But I look at Ayurveda and I always just think of preventative health, looking after yourself

235
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,789
consistently well, to, to live a healthier and happier life.

236
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,830
Is that a simplistic way to think about it?

237
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,029
And people that come to our retreat have that experience of what it looks like to do something

238
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,190
regularly to look after your health before it gets too bad.

239
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,690
Is that, is that a fair, fair call?

240
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,690
Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,269
Ayurveda is definitely prevention focused.

242
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:36,149
It does have treatment modalities, but I think you touched on it, just, just going to Bali

243
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,889
is like a treatment in itself.

244
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,190
I was there last year and literally two people from Australia in the first 24 hours I was

245
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,769
there, both one had moved there from Sydney and the other one, I think from Melbourne.

246
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,549
And both of them said exactly almost word for word, it's so much easier to be healthy

247
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:58,750
in Bali because just that, that surrounding stress is not, you know, you're on your motorbike

248
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,149
and you're just going to park it wherever you are, right outside the restaurant.

249
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:05,149
And you know, you're not scared you're going to get a fine or the people are friendly.

250
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:11,029
It's just, there's this relaxed lifestyle that surrounds even the treatment.

251
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:17,029
So the question underlying it is how do we take those principles back to our lives in

252
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:20,350
Australia as a, as more at prevention focused.

253
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:28,629
And again, I think it's starting really, really simply just to appreciate that community and

254
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,889
how we value the older people in our communities.

255
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:34,889
Yeah.

256
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,870
And the two things in my research, and this is not just Bali, it's cultures all around

257
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
the world.

258
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,649
The two distinguishing features of them are that they live in communities.

259
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,549
So how can we focus maybe more on our relationships and our friendships and that extended family

260
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,529
rather than just going to the gym and getting the six pack and drinking the green smoothies

261
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,549
or blanching our almonds or whatever it is.

262
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,850
And then, and this is a difficult one, but it's more a societal thing, how we bring more

263
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,769
value and veneration and esteem to the older people in our communities.

264
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:11,129
So that mind body connection as we age gets strengthened rather than the opposite, which

265
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,649
we often have.

266
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,649
So roundabout question to yours or answer to yours, but yeah, in terms of the Sukhavati

267
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:25,870
and those, those treatments, I think it's just the icing on the cake to really sort

268
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,870
of.

269
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,870
Yeah.

270
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,870
I might ask you a bit more detail on that, but going back to the connection and community

271
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,870
piece, I'm reading a book I'm really enjoying at the moment.

272
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
Yeah.

273
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,470
It's called Lost Connections.

274
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,429
He's just released another book that's international bestseller everywhere, which I'm looking forward

275
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,350
to getting onto next on Focus and the algorithms and social media and AI and what that's doing

276
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,350
to us.

277
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,409
But one of the surveys he references, one of the studies is that decades and decades

278
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,590
ago in the US, people would, on average, if you asked them if they had how many people

279
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,370
in their life that would trusted confidence, they could ring and would support them.

280
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,110
Most people had at least three people in that light where they could share anything with,

281
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,629
would get that support.

282
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:09,750
But the overwhelming answer now for people in the US is zero.

283
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
Yeah.

284
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,750
So you have to say that again.

285
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,350
The majority of people have not got one person that they feel like can support them or they

286
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
could support themselves.

287
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,669
Like we have completely lost our way with, you know, even when I grew up, you knew all

288
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:24,669
your neighbors.

289
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,629
They often became your extended family and family friends.

290
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,110
And now we live with along more people, but no one speaks to their neighbors anymore.

291
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,110
We've lost that connection, haven't you?

292
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,110
Would you agree with that?

293
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,110
Totally.

294
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,110
Yes.

295
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,110
Yeah.

296
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,110
And I love his research.

297
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,230
I love the story about the cow, the depressed guy and the cow, you remember that one, in

298
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,230
Cambodia.

299
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,230
But yes.

300
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,509
And I often quote the study that I'm sure you've mentioned on the podcast previously,

301
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,230
but the Harvard University study, the longest study ever done on wellbeing, now up to 80

302
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,870
years, four different directors went back to the 1930s, I think, where they had two

303
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,230
groups of young men from one from a low socioeconomic group.

304
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,069
Boston, Tennessee.

305
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,349
The other one from a high socioeconomic going into Harvard studies, and they tracked them

306
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,829
for 80 years.

307
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:16,509
And basically the single finding was that the most important thing for our lifelong

308
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:21,190
wellbeing wasn't blood pressure or cholesterol or how much sleep we got, but the quality

309
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,829
of our relationships and the number of social connection, particularly those that we could

310
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,710
depend on when times got tough.

311
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,630
And so exactly backing up what you've just said.

312
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,230
And you've done a lot of work into the Blue Zone communities.

313
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,869
And people listening to this podcast would have heard me talk about that before, the

314
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:43,710
Okinawans in Japan and Sardinia in Italy and several other communities around the world

315
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,950
that routinely live to 100 and work healthily and happily to that age.

316
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,470
And that is the older you get, the more revered you are in the communities.

317
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,029
In fact, the locals, you don't want to touch people that are older, just feel a bit of

318
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,029
that wisdom.

319
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,029
Yeah.

320
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,029
We put people in nursing homes and don't visit them, don't we?

321
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,029
Yeah.

322
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,029
Absolutely.

323
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,029
Tragic.

324
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,029
Absolutely heartbreaking and tragic in every way.

325
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,029
Yeah.

326
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:14,589
Both for the outlaws with the wisdom, the wisdom holders, but also such a loss for everyone

327
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,589
else in our community.

328
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:21,269
I remember when I studied in my Ayurved course, I had a teacher who had such wisdom.

329
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:27,470
One of our practical assignments was to go into a nursing home or to interview someone

330
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,509
over the age of 75 years of age.

331
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,670
It was one of the best things I can remember doing.

332
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,670
Yeah.

333
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,670
It was so good for me, wisdom that I otherwise wouldn't have got, and so good for the people

334
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,349
we were interviewing because it gave them a purpose, they got to share their wisdom.

335
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:46,910
So there's just such a loss for people in their 20s and 30s and 40s that don't get that

336
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,470
wisdom because their grandma or grandma's not on TikTok or seem to be up with the latest

337
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,470
tech or such a shame.

338
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,109
It's tragic, isn't it?

339
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:01,029
When you break it down, go back briefly again to ... I love that you said this, that the

340
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,029
community, the connection.

341
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:05,710
The connection, the getting back to nature, that's the essence of good health and good

342
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,710
life.

343
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,269
I've found the treatments to be pretty profound, too, and when you get into that space for

344
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:18,609
prevention health, they are magic, I would describe them as, and life-changing.

345
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:23,470
Can you give a bit of a ... People come to a place like Sukhavati Bali, which clearly

346
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,109
I've got a passion for, and they do a treatment called Panchakarma, for example.

347
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,150
Why is that so profound in the way it works?

348
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,150
It's so profound.

349
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,990
It's so profound.

350
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,990
Why?

351
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,089
Because the health remedies we rely on during a year when we're in our busy lives and there's

352
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:43,430
pollution out the door and there's stress only get to a certain level.

353
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,109
One example is toxins.

354
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:51,829
Toxins come into our body, sometimes in the food we eat, the environment, and they get

355
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,869
lodged into the adipose tissue, the fat tissue.

356
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,670
We can go and do a two or three day intermittent fast, or we can do a detox for a week, and

357
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,670
that's it.

358
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,670
And that won't really dislodge those deeply rooted toxins.

359
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:12,789
Panchakarma, which is for those who haven't experienced it, you imagine those beautiful

360
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,509
brochures with people lying on their backs, getting oil dripped over them, and massages

361
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,910
with one or two people, and it's blissful.

362
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,589
But what it does, if you do it properly, which you obviously do at Sukhavati, is a pre and

363
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:28,670
a post treatment.

364
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,670
So like everything in the West, Panchakarma has become a bit ... You know?

365
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,670
Yeah.

366
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:36,349
Flavor of the month, and people race over to India or America, and they sort of get

367
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,349
off the plane, and they go and do their seven or 10 days, and they jump straight back on

368
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:43,509
the plane, and by the time they get back, they don't feel any better.

369
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,369
In Sukhavati, they understand the traditional wisdom that there is a pre-treatment.

370
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,890
So there's certain diet you go into to loosen up those deeply held impurities, and then

371
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,250
you have the treatments that help dislodge them, get into the elimination track, and

372
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,670
then the post treatment is really important.

373
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,670
Yeah.

374
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,289
And rejuvenate the body.

375
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:08,089
So the analogy we learned in our training was when you're drinking herbal teas or you're

376
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,809
having a certain diet, it's like you pacify the imbalances in the body.

377
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:18,730
In Ayurveda, they're called doshas, D-O-S-H-A-S, and it's like you're sort of patting them

378
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,730
down.

379
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,309
If it's a tree, you're sort of spraying the water on the leaves, and you're sort of giving

380
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,710
a bit of fertilizer.

381
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,349
In Panchakarma, you're completely ripping the roots of the tree.

382
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:32,910
You're putting the tree out of the ground and replanting it.

383
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,369
So you're almost just cleaning the slate clean, and then you're able to reinvigorate and rejuvenate

384
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,049
the body from scratch.

385
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,809
So it's like you come out and you've experienced it.

386
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:43,809
I've experienced it.

387
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,849
People experience it all the time.

388
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,410
I feel like a new person.

389
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,769
You go to a health retreat for a weekend, which are great.

390
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm not minimizing those impacts.

391
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,529
They're fantastic.

392
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,970
But this is like, I feel better.

393
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,369
I've got more energy.

394
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,789
This is like, I feel like my old self again.

395
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:01,789
You know?

396
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,329
And that's the way I describe it, buddy.

397
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:08,210
When I come back from there and have some time, I feel like ... I describe it like a

398
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,210
grease and oil change.

399
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,849
I feel like I've put the body in for a service, but for the next six months, I'm dialed back

400
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:15,849
in.

401
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:17,890
I make better choices after that.

402
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,930
I eat better again, and I just feel really back to the version that you want to be.

403
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,930
I did want to share a bit of a personal story, because I know he'd be happy if he was here,

404
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,970
to do it, around my dad, who got a multiple myeloma blood cancer.

405
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:43,109
I think it was close to his 72nd birthday, and the prognosis, talking to his oncologist,

406
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:48,490
going back after we'd lost dad eventually, it wasn't great at all.

407
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,609
In fact, probably in the handful of months.

408
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:56,349
And I wanted to take dad up to Sukhavati, because one, I just thought it'd be beautiful

409
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,349
for him.

410
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:02,230
He had been there before, but I'm one of four, and the four siblings, we decided that

411
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,670
we would all go and do that with him.

412
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,170
He had some treatment here, he had some chemo and some radiotherapy, but then as soon as

413
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,869
that was the case, he would get on a plane and go there for a couple of weeks.

414
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:21,009
And then in the end, he did a nine or 10-week stay, and he would come back, and his doctors

415
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,390
back here in Melbourne just were going, I don't know what you're doing.

416
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,390
Mm-hmm.

417
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:33,069
Markers are off the charts, and it was just incredible to see what happened.

418
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:38,529
And what I genuinely feel, and I know I spoke to dad before he eventually passed, he felt

419
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:43,569
like he'd got six brilliant bonus years, and they were brilliant years because he genuinely

420
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,950
knew that they were in overtime, for want of a better word.

421
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,990
So you're right, and that's taking it, when you've taken someone there incredibly sick,

422
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,269
to still be able to get that sort of benefit at that stage of life was a pretty good thing.

423
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,269
Mm-hmm.

424
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,509
Pretty special thing to watch, actually.

425
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:57,910
Yeah.

426
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:02,750
Well, to jump in, I've got a very similar story, and I think you're going to bring it

427
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:10,349
up yourself, but my wife, I was married 14 or 15 years ago, Sydney girl, and it touched

428
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,769
on one of the topics we just sort of touched on earlier, and we're thinking sort of around

429
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:20,670
this idea of, we know the theory of health a lot, these simple wisdoms, but very challenging

430
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:26,109
to put in, and she was in an environment which was very, very stressful for her, really

431
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,789
toxic, had been in it for seven years when we sort of got together, and when I was going

432
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:32,930
out with her, I did the same thing.

433
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,349
We called it the sweep it under the carpet routine, you know, it was a bit of a challenging

434
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:42,809
situation, too hard to sort of change, so we rationalized that stress was a part of

435
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,470
life, and stress was a part of the job, nothing will happen to us, and sweep it under the

436
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:54,630
carpet, and about three months after we got married, she went to the doctor, routine check,

437
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,910
came back with diagnosis.

438
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,490
She had breast cancer, but it wasn't early stages, sort of right through her body, you

439
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,549
know, most organs, so it was a pretty uphill battle right from there, but I still remember

440
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:12,650
at Sydney airport, we moved out, we were sort of living in a sort of part of the house of

441
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,210
her parents, because if I was still working, they looked after her, they were absolutely

442
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,269
amazing, and so we brought up this idea of going to India to do some panchakarma for

443
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,089
her, and the parents were very old school, you know, they were like, meet me at the hospital,

444
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,430
and veg at nine o'clock at night to get your strength up, so all the sort of Ayurvedic

445
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,970
stuff I was trying to sort of suggest wasn't going down too well, so Kara found that really

446
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,769
tough, because she was sort of caught between the east and the west, and the parents, and

447
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:43,490
the, so that wasn't great, but we finally got them around to letting me take her to

448
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,349
India, they came to the airport, and I remember the mother asking her, as we were going through

449
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:54,349
the terminal, the departure terminal, would you like a wheelchair to make it easier to,

450
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,470
you know, get through?

451
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:00,349
Karen declined, but that's how bad she was, basically, going to India, and then she's

452
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:04,150
got to get on a flight to, you know, India, and then India's crazy.

453
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:09,849
When she came back, the parents basically said, if you want to go, take her back again,

454
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:15,009
we'll pay for it, anything you want to do, because she was just so much better, and again,

455
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:21,109
like, gave her five, six much better quality of years before she finally passed.

456
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:26,009
So, I mean, for someone who's spent, you know, from professional assets...

457
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:29,430
That's led into the world of health and wellbeing, you get married three months after you're

458
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,869
married, your wife diagnosed, as you said, with incredibly challenging upfront battle

459
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:41,670
with cancer, I mean, I can't even understand how tough that must have been, and your desire

460
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:47,569
to try and help and heal, I mean, how challenging was that at that, and then I want to ask you

461
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:53,430
also about stress, you mentioned stress there, you know, stress's role in creating illness

462
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,250
at the same time.

463
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,769
Yeah, well, I'll start with the second question.

464
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:02,789
Second question first, and that's really the lesson that came out for me, everything

465
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:09,970
I think is a lesson in life, before Karen got sick, I had most of the same knowledge

466
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,289
of Ayurveda, and I thought, you know, I know about health, it's all good in theory, and

467
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:18,529
then I think life tests you, you know, here's smack you on the head, and how much do you

468
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:24,630
really know, and so, but hers was, I would say, 99% stress-based.

469
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,210
Absolutely.

470
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,390
She meditated, she sipped hot water, she did most of the Ayurvedic things, you know, bed

471
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,450
early, pretty quiet life like me, just a massive, it's like that analogy of you put the frog

472
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,349
in the warm water, or cold water, heat it up gradually over time, the frog will stay

473
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,930
in the water, even when the water's absolutely boiling, and we do it with life, you know,

474
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,769
the stress just starts, it's a little, and a little, 10 years later, you look back, and

475
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,390
you're just swimming in it, and that was the case with Karen.

476
00:27:55,769 --> 00:28:00,569
The first question, the answer is really, and I say it now, blessing and a curse all

477
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:01,410
wrapped up in one.

478
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,809
The day she got diagnosed was certainly the worst day of our lives, and the subsequent

479
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,930
seven or eight year battle, but in other ways, it was absolutely the best day of our lives,

480
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:15,029
and the best thing that ever happened to both of us.

481
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:21,369
She got an excuse, basically, to get out of that toxic situation, she got much better

482
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:25,750
perspective on her life, which I did too, you know, and as we're talking about the

483
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:31,690
these simpler cultures, that maybe, you know, work, and money, and flying around the world,

484
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:36,150
doing talks wasn't the most important thing in life, and just having a good relationship,

485
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,690
and simply, so we learnt so much.

486
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,470
She began to paint, her parents were both really good painters, she'd almost never held

487
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,150
a paintbrush, she began painting, and you would not believe the paintings, unbelievable.

488
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:55,509
And so yeah, so many good things came out of it, and probably the word I always struggle

489
00:28:55,509 --> 00:29:00,970
whether I use it or not is regret, because I think everything has its purpose, and she's

490
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,069
in a better place now, and I certainly have beliefs on afterlife, and you know, physical

491
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:13,849
death, and all that sort of thing, so, but yeah, I regret back at that time, not having

492
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:18,910
the courage or the bravery to say, hey, we've got to change this now, let's do something

493
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,869
about this situation, not just let's sweep it under the carpet, because it's a difficult

494
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,109
decision.

495
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,309
So I think that.

496
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:30,089
That sort of permeates for all of us, that we tend to put things off, and put things

497
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,869
off, particularly as men, you know, sort of the lesson for me now is, let's do them when

498
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:39,829
they come up, and focus on the sort of simple, truly nourishing things.

499
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:45,269
So it's intuition again, I'm seeing something here that's clearly life-shortening, and stressful,

500
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:50,269
and that sort of health, there's always an alternative to avoid that, no matter how hard

501
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:50,569
it seems.

502
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:55,490
And we find that hard, don't we, to shift jobs, or relationship, whatever it is, or

503
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:00,869
partnerships we're in, because we find the challenge of moving really, you know, we all

504
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:04,369
do, it's hard, but, you know, again, you're going back to what you said at the start of

505
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,789
this interview, which was, your intuition doesn't let you down, you know, too often.

506
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,549
You did a beautiful thing, I was reading last night, you've shared the journal of your,

507
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:18,569
you know, your wife, Karen, and her thoughts, and I went through, I couldn't stop reading

508
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:22,710
it, actually, I just, it was a really generous thing to do, and I, you know, you prefaced

509
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,549
it by saying that she'd planned to do it herself.

510
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,630
Yeah.

511
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,650
Yeah.

512
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:24,670
Yeah.

513
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:24,730
Yeah.

514
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:24,750
Yeah.

515
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:24,769
Yeah.

516
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:24,789
Yeah.

517
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,809
Yeah.

518
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:24,829
Yeah.

519
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:24,849
Yeah.

520
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:24,869
Yeah.

521
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:24,890
Yeah.

522
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:24,910
Yeah.

523
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:24,930
Yeah.

524
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:24,970
Yeah.

525
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:24,990
Yeah.

526
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,250
A bit of your humour in there along the way, Bunny, which I enjoyed as well, but, and

527
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,950
then just some of her favourite quotes as well, it was a really moving thing to read.

528
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:41,549
The first quote you had, spread love everywhere you go, let no one ever come to you without

529
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:47,089
leaving happy, it's a Mother Teresa quote, but pretty profound wisdom she was getting

530
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,289
through that time, wasn't it?

531
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,769
When you sit back and read, you know, how open she was on all that, I encourage you

532
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,970
to go and look up Mark Bunn's website.

533
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,970
Yeah.

534
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,970
And check that out.

535
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,970
It was, it was brilliant.

536
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,970
Yeah.

537
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,329
And I think it, and you might've found the same thing with your dad.

538
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:06,289
I think when people are at that point where they sort of are closer to that, we call it

539
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,650
dropping the body, you know, that sort of death, that means they're also closer to the,

540
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:17,349
whatever we call it, you know, that high consciousness, the transcendent sort of level of life where

541
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:23,210
as we started with the conversation, those, those impulses, those seeds of intelligent

542
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,210
wisdom.

543
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,250
They're, they're most lively, you know, that's why we, you know, I meditate every day, you

544
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,089
know, when we transcend, we go beyond the busyness of the arguments and the work and,

545
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:38,089
and we get to that sort of peaceful, quiet place within us where those seeds of, of wisdom

546
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,089
are.

547
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:42,549
And so death is an, is another transition that gets us in touch with that.

548
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:47,869
So yeah, the closer she got the, the, um, the more she was able to sort of just naturally

549
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:50,210
bring those sort of things out, which was really, really nice.

550
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,210
I'll ask you about transcendental meditation in a moment.

551
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,210
But I was smirking on my own.

552
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,170
My mind was going to my dad and, uh, and this is classic him, he was an old school

553
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,329
public and, uh, money, great person.

554
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:04,069
I couldn't have had a better relationship and credit to him, you know, we, we, we've

555
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:08,089
asked him to, you know, go and take on this whole new system of health.

556
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:12,430
And my sisters, we went to every appointment with him and we were, uh, you know, my beautiful

557
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,609
sisters and my older brother were really just, we wanted him around.

558
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:20,089
And so we're going to do anything to come and be sitting down with the head doctor up

559
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,089
there.

560
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,089
Dr. Arju.

561
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,089
I think you know.

562
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:26,329
I was talking, uh, Dr. Arju about alcohol and you know what they're like, the Ayurvedic

563
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,329
doctors.

564
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,329
They're brilliant.

565
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:29,329
Alcohol is fine.

566
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,329
Mr. David, it's a good, it's a good thing.

567
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,329
And dad's, you know, how much, how much?

568
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,329
And, uh, and he's, oh, no, no problems.

569
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:33,329
You know, maybe 60 mils every three months.

570
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:34,329
And dad's got 60 mils.

571
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,329
Why spill 60 mils a night?

572
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,329
What do you mean?

573
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:48,750
That's a, so the perspective was, you know, and dad genuinely then just shifted everything

574
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,089
and changed and got those five better years.

575
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:55,329
I, I'll come back with, you learnt to meditate as well.

576
00:32:55,329 --> 00:33:00,329
You know, you, you dialed into everything and, um, and it had a massive impact.

577
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:03,329
You've been a passionate, uh, meditator in that space for a long years.

578
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,329
You teach Transcendental Meditation.

579
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,329
People listening have heard me bang on about it a lot.

580
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:08,329
Why should you do it?

581
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:09,329
Why, why does it work so well?

582
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:14,849
Uh, well, I, I started a long time ago, so I was 19 and I, I noticed, Darcy, you haven't

583
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:20,329
brought up my, uh, very, um, dignified and, uh, glamorous AFL career.

584
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:21,329
So.

585
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:22,569
That's probably the fact that.

586
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,569
How many did you play, buddy?

587
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:27,769
No, I'm, I'm, I'm taking the piss because I'm, I'm glad you didn't because it's very

588
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:28,769
inglorious and, um.

589
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:29,769
How many games did you play?

590
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:32,769
The less, the less said about it, the better, mate.

591
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,849
Um, I got, I got to 50, but that was about it.

592
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,849
Just got over the wall.

593
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,089
Well, you're in the top, not many people get to 50 games, buddy, so.

594
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:46,329
But, um, no, I learnt, I was 19, so I just, I just played my third game of AFL footy and,

595
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:50,569
uh, my brother-in-law was a Victorian wicket keeper, Michael DiMartino.

596
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:54,170
And my darling sister had both learnt.

597
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,609
And they said, cause I was no good at footy, they said, oh, this might be good for you.

598
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,609
Needed all the help I could get.

599
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:02,730
So I went along and, uh, yeah, best thing I've ever done.

600
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:08,869
So I, I sort of talk about, it's like a holiday for my brain and body twice a day, regardless

601
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:10,489
of what's going on.

602
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,869
Just allows me to get beyond the stress and the agitation and just sort of get to that

603
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,969
sort of quiet space.

604
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,369
So, um, yeah, it's just been, it's, it's just a.

605
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:24,769
Foundation for me, it becomes a habit, you know, I've since gone on and researched sort

606
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:28,710
of a, you know, like you, a lot of the top performing business people around the world.

607
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,650
My research suggests that the single most common trait habit or daily ritual of the

608
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:42,369
world's highest level performers, male, female, other gender, parent, athlete, artist, you

609
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:46,829
name it, is that they close their eyes and either do some form of mindfulness or they

610
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:49,789
do transcendental meditation twice a day.

611
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:50,289
And.

612
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:53,829
And it's just the analogy of our life.

613
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,510
You know, I have a friend in the U S we were, I speak over there and she has a, a saying

614
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,969
that we, we bow down to the altar of activity in the west.

615
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,630
You know, everything's about activity.

616
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:14,190
Whereas in the east and what TM does is it brings out the fundamental wisdom that success

617
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,289
is not based on our activity alone, but on the ancient natural formula.

618
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,730
Of rest and activity.

619
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,289
The more dynamic you want the activity to be, the deeper you need the rest, the higher

620
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:34,670
the skyscraper you want to build, the deeper you got to dig down first, the further you

621
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,210
want the arrow to go forward, the further you got to pull it back.

622
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:45,030
And so TM or transcending is like drawing the arrow back.

623
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,969
We get that dissolution of stress.

624
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,369
We get that clarity.

625
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:50,170
We get that.

626
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,489
We get it clear.

627
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,489
We get it.

628
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,489
We get that.

629
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:54,489
We get that clarity.

630
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,489
The moment we come out and we come out and we get the same quality of success that we

631
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,489
had, and we get the same mechanism of success that we had to, to, to for the past couple

632
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,489
of years in the past, we had the same objectives that we had, but now we have to come out, we

633
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,489
have a, a new lens of success, but now we've got a new objective that we need to push the

634
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,489
pendulum to a higher place, a new course.

635
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:00,489
That is a beautiful description of it.

636
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:03,349
I've never been able to get the words out quite like that, but I agree with everything

637
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:08,389
you said and, you know, I know you so many people around the world, the people will know,

638
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:11,110
but didn't know that that was part of what they do.

639
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:18,150
And again, I was thinking of Jerry Seinfeld, for whatever reason, who's a lifelong transcendental meditator and, you know, he's got his way of describing it.

640
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:26,630
But he talks about just putting almost like you've got the iPhone charger and you just turbocharge that energy and that clarity twice a day.

641
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,030
Holiday for a brain, you called it.

642
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,329
Yeah.

643
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,969
I think there might be a Hugh Jackman analogy, the holiday for the brain.

644
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:43,349
He's been, again, another 40-odd year practitioner and, yeah, so many of those sort of creative, high activity, high success people have done it.

645
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,440
I'm going to ask you some specific thing about leadership and your unique leadership story in this space.

646
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:03,840
But a lot of what you do in your leadership is helping people achieve what you describe as higher states of consciousness.

647
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,139
Now, a lot of people, what does that even mean?

648
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,480
Why is that something that we would want to attain, a higher state of consciousness?

649
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,219
Can you start there?

650
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,900
We need a bit of woo-woo music in the background.

651
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah, you're going to get a bit deep on us here, aren't you?

652
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,199
Yeah, a bit esoteric.

653
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,840
So, yeah, let's break it down.

654
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,780
And basically, we think of brain science.

655
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,780
Neuroscience is the Western correlate these days.

656
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,539
We know about the importance of the brain.

657
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:38,800
If we can make the brain work better, more integrated, so we know there's different lobes, different parts of the brain, that if they go offline and they don't communicate with each other,

658
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:41,019
performance decreases.

659
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:52,599
If we can make the brain, if we like, more expanded so that it can comprehend a more broader range of things, we're going to be better as a business leader.

660
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,480
You know, so many different parts of our business and our life that we need to keep on top of.

661
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:07,539
If we have a more broader comprehension, we can keep all those parts in place and know what to attend to at a certain time.

662
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:08,539
At the same time,

663
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:13,199
what we also want as a leader is precision focus.

664
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:20,820
So when it is time to make a decision or to be clear on something, we need that sort of laser-like focus.

665
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:33,460
What transcendence does in these transcendence-based meditation techniques is they develop both simultaneously so that we have the prefrontal cortex, the front of our brain.

666
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,420
They often call it the CEO of our brain, incidentally, which is the focus and the task orientation.

667
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:46,739
But also what they call the default mode network, which is like this network of neurons that sort of those million-dollar ideas come from.

668
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,980
You know, when you're having a shower or you're having a sleep on the hammock and this idea comes, oh, shit, let's do this.

669
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:57,139
This is a brilliant idea, which we don't get when we're always sort of busy and thinking.

670
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:06,659
And so if we can develop those insights over time and we can reduce the stress from the physiology,

671
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,139
the more we can take stress.

672
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,659
The more we can take stress out of the body, the more those insights will naturally come.

673
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:21,920
And so really, higher states of consciousness are really just the body and the mind becoming more integrated.

674
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,360
So we meditate, we get rid of a bit of stress.

675
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,820
The body and the mind function more integrated, more coherently, we could say.

676
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,699
And then so that what the Eastern masters, the great yogis you hear about doing all these crazy things of, you know,

677
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,400
sitting out in the.

678
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:54,619
Ice and warming up their body or never getting stressed because they're in a state of enlightenment or self-realization is really nothing other than more consistent removal of stress without incurring more stress on top of it, which we do in the West.

679
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,079
Maharshi Mahesh Yogi, who's the founder of TM, has this great analogy.

680
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:07,179
And it's basically that if you have a piece of white cloth and you want to make it blue, you've got to dip it into the blue dye.

681
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,360
And then you don't leave it in there.

682
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,920
You take it out, expose it to the sun.

683
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,619
It fades, but there's a little bit of faint blue color.

684
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,619
You put it back in the dye, take it out, expose it to the sun.

685
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:26,840
And it's that alternation of in the dye out that over time makes the blue color permanent.

686
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
Same with our physiology.

687
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,239
We transcend.

688
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,360
We remove some stress.

689
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,340
We expose it to some activity.

690
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,039
Hopefully not too stressful.

691
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,039
We transcend.

692
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:53,500
Over time, as stress is removed from the body, the body's natural state, the body's natural state is a non-stress, completely coherent state where mind and body are functioning perfectly integrated fashion.

693
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,320
That is enlightenment.

694
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,440
When that becomes a 24-7 reality, that's enlightenment.

695
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,440
It's not esoteric.

696
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,820
Maharshi said it's the most practical thing we can do as people.

697
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,400
It's like as a business leader.

698
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,320
That's our first priority.

699
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,099
Why wouldn't you want perfect mind-body integration and have a higher state of consciousness than a lower one?

700
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:26,639
It's fascinating when you say it like that because to even understand what consciousness means would be a good question in the West.

701
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,639
Again, go back to the East, it's very much understood, isn't it?

702
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,179
And you revere the great masters, as you described, and your great teacher, Maharishi.

703
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,579
And his legacy.

704
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,760
It's lost a lot on the activity and the craziness, Bunny, of what we do.

705
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,659
And I'm certainly guilty of no doubt about it.

706
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,119
In different leadership settings, I've loved talking to, you know, your story's brilliant.

707
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,539
I've loved following it for a few decades now.

708
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,460
We feel like there's some common traits to leadership that are identifiable in the work we're doing in a business.

709
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,380
I'm just keen to talk to you about, Bunny, and call it a leader, where we're bringing together collaborative groups of leaders.

710
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,539
From different backgrounds.

711
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,800
And, you know, I love what you said about every business leader wants to have that harmony and synergy so your brain works and builds a bigger dimension.

712
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,380
We think you can achieve a bit of that through collaboration as well and bringing different minds together.

713
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:25,599
So we think the common trait first and foremost with anyone who is achieving in this space is a sense of self-leadership.

714
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,420
When I talk about that to you, what does that mean?

715
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,119
The self to me is the deepest part of ourselves.

716
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,119
So that sort of intangible non-self.

717
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,840
The non-physical part.

718
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:46,480
I think the part we all want to get in touch with and have more connection with, but we often don't know how to do it.

719
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:55,960
So we touched on intuition at the start of the podcast, and I think that's a nice tie-in.

720
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:09,130
So self-leadership is that trust of following the rudder or the guide of those intuitive impulses.

721
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:22,329
Which I think every business leader, as you said at the start, over their history will say the ones that they've followed have turned into the best business ideas, the best relationship builders, the sort of best things in their family life.

722
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:30,010
And the ones that they've sort of denied or gone with the data or the logical sort of outcomes haven't turned out so well.

723
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:38,369
So I think self-leadership is really about trust, trusting that sort of inner voice, that gut wisdom to sort of lead us on the right path.

724
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,269
Great description.

725
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:43,150
Bunny, I love, you know, again, I'm really focused back in on that intuition.

726
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,849
Again, my mind, I'm listening and I'm thinking at the same time.

727
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:47,909
I need today a lot.

728
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,630
Nicole Gibson was on this podcast.

729
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:56,969
Amazing young entrepreneur and leader and youngest ever person on a government commission.

730
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,250
She was on the Mental Health Commission.

731
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,170
Brilliant story.

732
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:03,650
And she's actually developing some tech around teaching people.

733
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,650
We've got these iPhones in our hand all day.

734
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,289
Yeah.

735
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:09,409
And, you know, they measure a lot of...

736
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:09,809
She'll do a book.

737
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:10,849
She'll do a much better job than me.

738
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:19,449
But, you know, to actually think about making decisions from that place and can we measure that in all the decision making is a healthier, happier life in that, isn't it?

739
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,130
If we take the time to stop and really...

740
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,969
We've even lost that art, haven't we, of actually just going inward to think about it first and foremost.

741
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:29,250
So if you haven't heard her podcast, have a listen to Nicole Gibson.

742
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:29,690
She's brilliant.

743
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,989
We think leaders are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment.

744
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:37,250
You speak around the world, around Australia.

745
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:38,989
One of the most sought after speakers in this society.

746
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:43,190
Space and clearly your life is about positive impact.

747
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,630
But how have you thought about that on a daily basis?

748
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,570
It's ever evolving for me.

749
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:58,409
One of the things I've really found I've loved, and even since Karen had her journey and passed away, that life certainly isn't perfect.

750
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:05,710
You know, that bubble of sort of, you know, there's this ancient wisdom that has this theory on life and it all sounded fantastic.

751
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:09,690
But, you know, like you, I'm bumbling away and trying to live life.

752
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:13,070
Not get too stressed and, you know, all that sort of stuff.

753
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,250
So I find it changes and evolves.

754
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,010
And I think it's that...

755
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:28,429
I think one of the best things we've heard over the last five years, and I'm sure you've interviewed many guests who've touched that whole idea of embracing our imperfections and our, you know, being vulnerable.

756
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,369
And that's been a big one for me.

757
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:39,650
Shame was a massive thing for me as a young sort of boy and adult and sort of putting on the mask of bravado and fear.

758
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:42,889
Failure in footy and not rewards of success, all that stuff.

759
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:48,409
So for me, it's really been coming back to just self-kindness is probably the best term for it.

760
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,369
That, hey, life is tough in many cases.

761
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:58,750
Yes, there's these great wisdoms of life and cultures that have sort of been a lighthouse for how we live individually and collectively.

762
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,510
But it's not easy unless you're in those cultures 24-7 to do it.

763
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,210
So let's sort of be kind, kind to myself, kind to those around us.

764
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,789
And just try and embrace that.

765
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:15,769
Embrace those wisdoms gradually over time so that collectively and as a society we can embrace them.

766
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,750
Because I think that's the real game changer when we do it, do it en masse.

767
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,250
You mentioned shame there.

768
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,190
What do you mean by that?

769
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:23,829
Yeah.

770
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:28,550
What was that so hard for you to overcome and where did that come from?

771
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:32,449
Well, I've only really found out probably the last five or 10 years.

772
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:37,510
I remember sitting at a kitchen table in Perth.

773
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,230
I was traveling over there.

774
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:44,929
And I was staying with a friend and telling, I can't remember what the original story was.

775
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:47,550
But she says, you have to read a book by John Bradshaw.

776
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,530
It's Healing the Shame that Binds Us.

777
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,190
One of the best books I've ever read.

778
00:46:52,269 --> 00:47:02,130
He was a sort of a religious American sort of pastor and alcoholic father and just massive shame issues.

779
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,030
And he went through just how shame manifests, you know, particularly as children.

780
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,130
And shame.

781
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:09,530
Shame.

782
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:12,409
This idea that shame loves secrecy.

783
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:17,230
That if you keep things in, shame just gets stronger and stronger and stronger.

784
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,090
And shame hates being spoken about.

785
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,289
And so I was a classic.

786
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:26,949
If you ask my parents, when I was a teenager, it was the classic family joke.

787
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:27,750
You know, I'd come back.

788
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:28,610
I'd play football.

789
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:32,469
And for some miraculous thing, I'd have a good game.

790
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,730
If I hadn't been to watch, they'd say, how'd you go?

791
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:35,849
And I'd say, good.

792
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:38,210
One word answers on everything.

793
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,110
Not bad.

794
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:39,590
Good.

795
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,690
I was just a shut up shop.

796
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:54,070
And even throughout my 20s and 30s, you know, I was always very reticent to sort of spruik myself or, you know, that whole sort of get smashed by the universe.

797
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,829
But I realized that I was just doing myself a lot of disservice.

798
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:08,590
And the great work of, you know, the Resilience Project and Ben Crow and these sort of people that are now showing us that the way we connect with others is through our imperfections and our invulnerabilities.

799
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:16,809
And so I really looked back at my history and saw that shame was really the driving emotion of most of my life.

800
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:25,289
You know, I was very conscious football and sport because I was good at it was my way of having a facade that I was successful.

801
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:29,769
And so I was driven to, as I said, so I didn't fail.

802
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:31,250
And so I didn't lose face.

803
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:34,110
If I had a bad game, I'd feel really embarrassed about it.

804
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,349
If I played well, it was all right for the next week.

805
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,190
And then it went into speaking, you know.

806
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:48,469
It was very much about the performance of speaking, which then shut off a little bit of that connection with the audience and really being there to sort of serve and get the message across.

807
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:57,610
So, yeah, probably particularly the last decade has been very much a journey of sort of realizing that that's been driving a lot of my life.

808
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:00,130
And now, so I open up a lot more.

809
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:06,269
I speak a lot more to friends and joined a men's group, which has been unbelievably powerful.

810
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:08,150
Just being able to share stuff.

811
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,369
That I wouldn't otherwise share.

812
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:14,190
And I find I'm now much more sort of, you know, a bit freer, a bit more playful.

813
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,429
My, you know, talks, I don't get so anxious about them.

814
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,469
I don't plan them as much.

815
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,769
This podcast, you know, no thought to bring you up and say, what are we going to talk about this?

816
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,849
And, you know, plan all this.

817
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,449
We just go with the flow a lot more.

818
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,210
And so life's just a lot more enjoyable.

819
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:37,969
And what Ben Crow and the researchers, Brené Brown, all these people show that when we sort of put shame under the spotlight.

820
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,690
And we're just open about it, then it sort of loses its power and life becomes a bit more joyful.

821
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,289
So that's my journey and still a long way to go.

822
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,710
Yeah, it's probably a pretty common one, isn't it?

823
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:50,530
Very common.

824
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,090
For all of our generation, isn't it?

825
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,369
We really weren't taught any other way.

826
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,050
And there wasn't conversations on any of it.

827
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,610
It wasn't open to anyone, was it?

828
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:08,170
And it is great credit, isn't it, to Ben Crow and to Brené Brown, the international champion of this space, isn't it?

829
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,650
It is.

830
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,210
But I love, you know, you listen to her in recent times as well.

831
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:19,170
She talks about authentic vulnerabilities too, like anything in the needle can switch kind of too to inappropriate vulnerability.

832
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:23,809
And, you know, you've got to then reteach back to say we can overshare, you know.

833
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,090
Time and place.

834
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,090
There's a time and place.

835
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:31,110
But we came out of the generation, funny, where the door wasn't open at all for any of it.

836
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:34,570
And that caused huge issues for, you know, a whole generation.

837
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:35,190
Yeah.

838
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:36,750
Men and women.

839
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:38,090
But the men were privileged.

840
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,469
Probably even at the point you're in, in some ways, about not having anywhere to go on that space.

841
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,550
We often see people who are really clear on creating and sharing a vision.

842
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:49,630
And I've got to go back to your book.

843
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,570
It is absolutely brilliant.

844
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:51,409
You're a brilliant writer.

845
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,469
You know, Ancient Wisdom for Modern Health.

846
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,269
It is a three-time bestseller, as I said.

847
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,070
You've got a great way of explaining things.

848
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,429
And you can hear that in the way you're talking today.

849
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,269
How have you gone about creating and sharing your vision?

850
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,710
Back to the first word I mentioned on the podcast.

851
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:07,469
Simplicity is my...

852
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,170
I guess my skill set, something we haven't discussed today,

853
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,670
which is really another fundamental of Ayurvedic wisdom, is Dharma.

854
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:30,969
Dharma is that activity, that vocation, that helps us to evolve maximally.

855
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,469
So people talk about today, you know, passion in life, your higher purpose.

856
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:37,469
So in Ayurveda, it's like that, but it's actually a deeper.

857
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,070
It's like almost...

858
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:42,590
It's our duty in life that we're born for a specific reason to fulfill.

859
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,309
We do that.

860
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:46,070
Life flows, the analogy of surfing the wave.

861
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,510
And we're the greatest service to those around us.

862
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,989
So Dharma is a real key plank to that.

863
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:02,510
And my Dharma, I'm pretty confident, is to help take what can be complex or esoteric

864
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:08,150
or woo-woo type things and hopefully simplify them down that they're more practical for

865
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,170
people.

866
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,650
And I think it's really important to help people that are just out there and struggling

867
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:17,829
with the four or five kids and the crazy boss and the, you know, road rage and all that

868
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:18,150
sort of thing.

869
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,030
So yeah, it's really about simplicity.

870
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,789
I really believe that it's just about cutting out the waste.

871
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:29,369
And the waste, I mean, just the complication and trying to do too many things too well.

872
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:35,050
You know, health's sort of my speciality and I see it every day in health.

873
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,730
You know, people out there trying to have the perfect diet.

874
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,769
And they spend half their day, you know, I said, blanching their freaking almonds and

875
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:46,590
grinding their linseeds and which means then they don't have time for the good relationships

876
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,349
or, you know, they've got a fantastic relationship.

877
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:53,130
They're just not nourishing or they've got a healer relationship or exercise.

878
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:54,550
So we can't do everything.

879
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,829
But what are the real fundamentals?

880
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:02,750
And we need to keep life simple to sort of focus on those sort of key things we touched

881
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,110
on earlier in the episode.

882
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:04,909
No doubt.

883
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,690
In my mind, that is your gift, listening to you.

884
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,469
And reading your work.

885
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,510
It's, you know, the thing of Scotty Pate, the Barefoot Investor, I spoke to on this

886
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:19,590
podcast and there's a million books have been written on finance and Pate, he was talking

887
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,489
about sort of almost the backhanded compliment.

888
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,650
Oh, geez, it's so basic the way you write.

889
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,730
And he goes, yes, that's what I do.

890
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,409
You know, that's the art of it.

891
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:31,369
And there's a lot of skill behind that.

892
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:35,690
You know, he's sold plenty of books on making.

893
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:37,449
Well, I wrote the book, funnily enough.

894
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:44,630
Um, because I think as authors, we do try and make out where we're smart and put sort

895
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:49,570
of Sanskrit words or words that, but one of my principles of writing the book was if there's

896
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:55,489
a word that 95% of the population might not understand or a bit confused, I wouldn't use

897
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:55,690
it.

898
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:01,130
And so probably the most common feedback I had of the book was easy to read.

899
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,690
People just found it easy to read.

900
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,670
So, yeah.

901
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,590
And done with purpose on exactly that.

902
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,849
And, um, curiosity is a word that we hear a lot around the leaders that we're working

903
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:17,289
with at Alita and, and through curiosity, that's how we finding people are approaching

904
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:18,570
their learning and development.

905
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,809
Does that resonate with you?

906
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:25,449
Love curiosity and, and something I haven't been good at.

907
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,570
And so why I love the question, because it's probably a new, a new term and a new field

908
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:36,130
for me, but yeah, I think I was really shut off to, to new knowledge and new inspiration

909
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,630
and, and teachers.

910
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,690
Uh, for much of my life.

911
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,889
And again, probably the last five, 10 years, I've really understood that, Hey, I don't,

912
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,389
I don't know everything long way from it.

913
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:52,010
And, uh, being curious of people that have sort of gone down paths that I haven't and

914
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:54,590
have wisdoms that I'm not sure about.

915
00:54:54,590 --> 00:55:01,449
So I love being curious, particularly of older people, those with the wisdom, but also people

916
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:06,090
just doing stuff that, uh, I haven't done like a Tim Ferris podcast.

917
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,670
I love his stuff because it's so broad.

918
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,690
And fascinating.

919
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,289
So very curious about, uh, life these days.

920
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:13,289
Yeah.

921
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:14,289
He's brilliant.

922
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:15,289
Tim Ferris.

923
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:16,289
Absolutely.

924
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:17,289
Isn't he?

925
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,289
And, and yeah, I love the beauty of this medium.

926
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,289
Isn't it now?

927
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,289
Is it in real time?

928
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:22,750
Might've taken someone 20 years to get around to writing a book where we're getting to sort

929
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:27,250
of learn really quickly, aren't we, from people doing great things and they're sharing more

930
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,809
than they probably ever have done before.

931
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:34,050
Communicating with clarity, um, again, is a common thing that we see leaders are really

932
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,050
conscious of and a real strength, I think of yours.

933
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:37,650
How have you gone about it?

934
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,860
Silence.

935
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:51,900
Probably not the answer you're expecting, but I was trying to bring a few of these threads

936
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:58,030
in of what we've discussed and I remember one of the, and it's still to this day, one

937
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:05,710
of the best quotes I've ever heard was by Claude Debussy and he said, silence is the

938
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,750
space between the notes or music.

939
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,510
So music is the space between the notes and that's life.

940
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,510
And, and that could be the same answer to.

941
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,510
A number of questions you asked me.

942
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:23,329
You could ask me another 10 and it could be the same answer because life is just so busy

943
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:27,349
and we think, we think that's the activity.

944
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:29,349
It's again, this rest and activity.

945
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:35,590
All the answers, how I find them, I think everyone finds them is in the gaps.

946
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:41,750
When we take a break from the activity, when we get that night off from the kids or we

947
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,510
have the two day break from work or, you know.

948
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:49,889
We switched the TV off or we're off the phone or off the technology.

949
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:52,050
That's when we get in touch with that intuition.

950
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:57,750
That's where that rest comes and that's where we get the answers, the solutions to whatever

951
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,989
we're dealing with in life.

952
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:05,690
So for me, I'd say just getting silent, going out in the nature, turning the technology

953
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,289
off, just being with myself.

954
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:11,510
We use that term self, self-leadership, I think that's where it all starts.

955
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,309
It's a consistent message that you've given us today.

956
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:18,210
How important is collaboration been for you?

957
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:28,130
I'm pausing because again, historically I haven't valued it and I've paid the price.

958
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:30,469
Just speaking to someone yesterday, I rang him up.

959
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:32,590
He's up in Mulaney in Queensland.

960
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:37,590
I'm starting a new brand called Dharmic Living.

961
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:42,809
And I was explaining to him that previously in my incarnations of business and speaking,

962
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:43,849
I've always tended to want to do it.

963
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:43,949
I've always wanted to do it.

964
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:44,010
I've always wanted to do it.

965
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:44,050
I've always wanted to do it.

966
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:44,150
I've always wanted to do it.

967
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,250
I've always wanted to do it.

968
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:44,269
I've always wanted to do it.

969
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:44,289
I've always wanted to do it.

970
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:44,309
I've always wanted to do it.

971
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:47,690
I've always wanted to do everything myself and I had the expert's hat on and I want

972
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,690
to do it this way.

973
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:55,349
I don't want people to ... And that I'd realized my mistake of that, that very narrow, not

974
00:57:55,349 --> 00:58:01,889
so enjoyable, that working as a team and from 40 days you would have known when you leave

975
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:09,449
a football environment or any sporting environment, you realize very quickly that you had a self-contained

976
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:14,250
everyday team, collaborative mix.

977
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,690
Which is beautiful.

978
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,909
And then you go into this, oh, all of a sudden I'm by myself and I've got to either create

979
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:22,750
new ones or I'm going to flail along.

980
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:29,110
And I flailed for ... I was successful, people would say I was successful, but that joy of

981
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,469
doing things wasn't as high as it could have been.

982
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:37,289
So yeah, collaboration, again, more recently is really coming to my forefront of my mind

983
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:43,690
and how I can do things with others so that it's one, more effective because people have

984
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,210
skillsets.

985
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,849
People have skillsets that I don't.

986
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:50,369
And it's just more fun and enjoyable, which I think's the way to live and healthier.

987
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:52,510
Brilliant answer.

988
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,150
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

989
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:02,940
Oh, it's hard to go past my father.

990
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:15,139
My father was not a business person per se, very staid, staid probably not the right word,

991
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:16,139
conservative.

992
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:17,139
Shunned the limelight.

993
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:23,800
No fanfare, but just in terms of what I'm now learning are the true principles of life

994
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:30,840
that a leader should impart, sort of kindness and volunteering for community and just such

995
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:37,039
an amazing parent, right back from taxiing me everywhere and my siblings.

996
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:43,760
So yeah, my father, I think in a different way would be a great leader.

997
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,579
Paul Roos comes up also for me.

998
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:52,500
He was my captain at Fitzroy and since had a bit to do with him because he's also in

999
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,039
the wellbeing space and the men's health space.

1000
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:04,079
But he, to me, from seeing as a coach, what he brought to the AFL was almost that first

1001
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:13,179
leader to change the perspective of a coach as this hierarchical do as I say, old school

1002
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:16,380
fear mentality to everything we've discussed.

1003
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:40,219
I think he was a great, great leader, which I sort of had the benefit of experiencing sort

1004
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:45,139
of firsthand as a player, but really I think blossoming as he went into coaching and obviously

1005
01:00:45,139 --> 01:00:46,139
now in business.

1006
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:51,900
I heard Roosie talk a lot about while he was playing, he was an unbelievable player, as

1007
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,739
you know, and at time, all Australian, one of the great players the games have assumed,

1008
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,860
but he wrote down this list of stuff.

1009
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,860
This is crazy.

1010
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,860
Yeah.

1011
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,480
If I ever get the chance, we're going to stop doing this and I've heard him say that he

1012
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,940
used to just pull that open drawer out when he was coaching and just go, just check, make

1013
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:12,940
sure I haven't drifted into some of that, but he definitely changed the nature of the

1014
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,260
way leaders in sport operate.

1015
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,260
It's a great legacy.

1016
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:15,760
Yeah.

1017
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,139
It's great.

1018
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:21,559
I didn't realize that he crossed over with Roosie as a player at Fitzroy.

1019
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:23,099
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration.

1020
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:28,480
A leader is all about inspiring connections, but in a world of collaboration is what we

1021
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,900
talk about and we're fascinated and I often give it a plug because people listening, we

1022
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,099
love the idea of bringing people together in these bespoke leadership groups, whatever

1023
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:42,980
your background, whatever it is and have to be Paul Roos or Mark Bunn or whoever it is,

1024
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,260
we think there's something brilliant in inspiring those connections.

1025
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,340
And the collaboration that comes out of them, we're seeing some brilliant stories and I've

1026
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:53,039
asked this question of everyone, if you could collaborate with anyone in the world or whatever

1027
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,860
passion on anything, but is there anyone that springs to mind?

1028
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:04,679
Bob Roth probably springs to mind, which I have had the pleasure of collaborating with

1029
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,679
or working with a little.

1030
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,860
Bob Roth is the head of the David Lynch Foundation in America.

1031
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:15,860
I know you've had the pleasure of meeting him a few years back in New York.

1032
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:21,679
But Bob is a Transcendental Meditation teacher, spent a lot of time with Maharshi and that

1033
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:28,920
whole knowledge, but is arguably the most practical person I know.

1034
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,199
One of his mottos is no woo woo.

1035
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:38,920
But as a leader, I think he's just an amazing embodiment of this.

1036
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,820
We spoke about this idea of broad comprehension, this expansion, we could call it a cosmic

1037
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,820
mindset.

1038
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,820
Yeah.

1039
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,900
Anything's possible.

1040
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,719
One of his other mottos is the answer's yes.

1041
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:55,760
As long as it's a good, I'm saying yes, and then we'll work out how to do it.

1042
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:07,650
But just really personal, down to earth, focused, he's there to serve, but just this amazing

1043
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:14,889
balance of this sort of cosmic mindset that everything's collaboration, everyone's connected,

1044
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:17,150
anything's possible.

1045
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:24,090
But when it's time to focus, he's right there, he's right with you, and just so inspiring,

1046
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,090
so inspiring.

1047
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,090
Yeah.

1048
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:31,349
I remember that night very clearly, and we were invited to this function, and Bec and

1049
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:36,090
I were in New York and hadn't met him before, and he got that presence around him.

1050
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:41,210
He came out, found the table, took the time to shake your hand, and then he just ... But

1051
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:44,150
we're sitting there, just the scale of the impact that he's having.

1052
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,150
A lot of people know David Lynch.

1053
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,150
Yeah.

1054
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,150
Yeah.

1055
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:53,130
David Lynch, and again, he's a lifelong meditator that, I believe, he might have put $50 million

1056
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,130
in to start the foundation.

1057
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:59,829
He's donated huge amounts, and I didn't quite understand how revered David Lynch is in Hollywood.

1058
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:03,969
He's sort of the producer that everyone wants to be, because he's made money doing stuff

1059
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:09,150
that isn't mainstream and can do what he likes, basically, David Lynch.

1060
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,769
But even just sitting there that night, I'm trying to think who was the ... The speaker

1061
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:17,090
list was just ... I think it started with Ariana Huffington, Michael J. Fox presented.

1062
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,090
Jerry Seinfeld might have done ...

1063
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,090
Seinfeld was there, yeah.

1064
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:23,429
It was just ... Not the name-dropping part of it, but then it was the kids in schools

1065
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:31,610
that they taught, and the post-traumatic stress with veterans, and just how sophisticated.

1066
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:35,210
It sounds like clearly a friend of yours, but brought through his genius that he's been

1067
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:41,969
able to have massive impact and pass on that knowledge in a really powerful way.

1068
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:42,969
He's the one.

1069
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:43,969
Yeah, I think so.

1070
01:04:43,969 --> 01:04:44,969
He's the one that comes to mind.

1071
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:45,969
So, yeah.

1072
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:51,210
But collaboration, as you say, is very key to his processes.

1073
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,210
Yeah, absolutely.

1074
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:57,949
Buddy, it's been a great pleasure catching up with you again, and hearing the work that

1075
01:04:57,949 --> 01:05:02,429
you do, and the simplicity in the way which you deliver it.

1076
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:08,809
It's a crossover passion of mine, clearly, but thanks for sharing today in such a profound

1077
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:09,809
way.

1078
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,909
I believe there's more books coming.

1079
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:15,969
Can we get a scoop on that, or we'll put you under the pump here with that last question?

1080
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:19,230
Yeah, well, they are coming.

1081
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:24,369
As I usually say to my family, the motivation is to live a long life, because then you might

1082
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:29,730
still be alive when they come out, but hopefully one or two are coming out in the next year

1083
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,730
or two.

1084
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,730
But don't hold your breath is always my motto.

1085
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,789
They will be full of wisdom.

1086
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:34,789
Thanks so much for joining.

1087
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:35,789
Good to see you.

1088
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:36,789
Thanks, Darcy.

1089
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:39,519
