1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
I remember when I was moving into position to catch a wave, I was so scared and nervous that

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,359
I had to literally rewire the process of what I was thinking about because I was triggering

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:15,179
thoughts of what if you fall off and all this kind of stuff. And I was literally trying to

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,879
change that process in that moment while I was moving towards it. And it was so intense. I've

5
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,280
never felt so scared before in my life, but I remember my heart pounding that hard that my

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,679
eyeballs were pulsing with my heartbeat. And I still to this day, I can't describe ever feeling

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:40,609
so fearful. This week's guest is legendary Australian big wave surfer Mark Visser. You're

8
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:45,509
going to hear Mark's insights into overcoming fear are fascinating to me and how when you

9
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,750
understand the techniques as he explains, your life can improve dramatically. Mark also explains

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,570
the advice he gives his mindset coach to people like 11-time world surfing champion Kelly Slater

11
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,729
and also the detail and preparation.

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,290
To ride a 40-foot wave off the coast of Hawaii in total darkness in the middle of the night

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,129
is an extraordinary story in itself. Mark Visser inspires the work we do at Alita. Check out our

teams and business professionals. He has a huge passion for helping individuals connect to their

27
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,270
ultimate self. Mark, great pleasure to catch up with you. Great to be here. How does a young boy

28
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,330
who grew up in country Victoria, hundreds of kilometers away from the water, go on to be

29
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,710
one of the world's most revered big wave surfers? Probably the fear of

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,430
just being so terrified in a space that I wanted to do whatever I could to get out of it.

31
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,750
That's probably the best summary because when I was younger, I had an experience where I literally

32
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,150
nearly drowned and that just changed the scope of my life going forward. You know, we were in the

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,550
country and then we moved to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, which is a tropical environment.

34
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,330
And I basically spent my life trying to overcome that fear of that water experience that rattled

35
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,729
me as a kid. But then I kind of made it almost a point to

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,849
prove to myself, I've gotten over this, I've gotten over this. And I didn't realize that that

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,650
consumed me in such a way that it turned into a career and a never-ending passion. And then

38
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,530
just overcoming fear itself became its own sense of a passion.

39
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:18,169
Mark, a bit more detail on that. It was a feed trough effectively full of water, is that correct?

40
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:19,270
Yeah, sheep's trough.

41
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,669
Sheep's trough. And how old were you and how close did you come to not being with us?

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,090
Yeah, the details on that, it's probably, I wouldn't remember it because I was three. So I was three years old.

43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,729
I was eating.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,030
I was eating a peach, dropped it into the sheep's trough and apparently just dove in head first for

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,349
it. And my mother told me that I was holding onto the peach underwater. And then basically they

46
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,509
weren't there, but my older brother saved my life. He pulled me out by my hair and he would have been

47
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:51,169
young. He would have only been maybe eight or seven years old himself. So for him to have done

48
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:57,330
that, he literally saved my life. I could have easily drowned in that situation. But mum said to

49
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,729
me, I wouldn't have a bar. I wouldn't have a bar. I wouldn't have a bar. I wouldn't have a bar.

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,750
For about a year or so after that. So it really must have rattled me to the core. And I don't

51
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,629
remember the experience, but it's really odd to say this. I remember the feeling. So I would go to

52
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:16,629
the ocean years later and have this elevated heart rate, not knowing why, or this fear of just

53
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:21,449
feeling like I'm not in control here and not knowing where does that come from or why. And I didn't

54
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,250
actually know it until years after that my mother told me about that. And then I went, oh, it was

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,370
like a feeling that came over me. It was like, oh, that all makes sense. So, you know, as a young

56
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,250
person, sometimes you might remember actual, the memory of a, of an image of something, but you

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,490
remember the feeling and that feeling was ingrained in me like no other. And that's, that's really

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,110
the being at the forefront of my mind, trying to push through that, that barrier, the majority of

59
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,209
my life. So much research we now mark into childhood trauma and the fact that we are dealing

60
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,230
with that scar tissue for our lives. And often it's unconscious. I mean, you're a great example

61
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,230
of actually unconsciousness. I mean, you're a great example of actually unconsciousness. I mean,

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,970
consciously experiencing that because you were too young, now consciously knowing about it and

63
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,449
that driving your whole life outcomes. It's a fascinating study. Family moved to the Sunshine

64
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,250
Coast. I suppose every kid you're going to school with has got a surfboard or the water dictates

65
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,730
life on the Sunshine Coast. So did you feel, hey, I've got this fear. I don't even know where it

66
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,670
comes from, but I've got to deal with it. Is that what drove you? Yeah. And full outcast, you know,

67
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,509
like feeling like every, like you said, you nailed it. Every single person had a bodyboard, surfboard,

68
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,310
confident, and the water was a fun place. Whereas I'm like, oh, I like the water too. But then as

69
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,269
soon as there was waves, I was like, I'm out of my depth and, and really felt like a, an outcast in

70
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:43,449
like, I don't know this world and I don't understand this space, but I'll try and play along. And then

71
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:49,129
every time, you know, you're exposed to situations, I remember just feeling like, oh, I'm so out of my

72
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,589
league here. And I almost sort of said to myself, oh, I'm never going to be someone that is going

73
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,810
to play in that space. Cause I, my parents enrolled me in a junior lifeguard program,

74
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,209
obviously called Nippers. The first exercise was something like you had to swim out to a can

75
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,769
and that was just so full on. So I remember thinking to myself, ah, I'll just focus on

76
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:13,589
the beach sprints. I'll just focus on the things that I knew I could do well. I felt like majority

77
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:18,750
of probably around about 14 or so, I felt like I had this connection to the ocean where

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,889
the ocean was almost felt like a person that I knew, which is really odd to say that,

79
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,509
like it was someone that was saying like, you're welcome in this space, come in this space. Yet I

80
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,230
was the most awkward person to feel that way. Like if anyone else had said that, who grew up surfing

81
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,910
or grew up doing things, you'd go, of course it's in your blood or whatever. Whereas it's not, you

82
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,930
know, but I felt that, that, that feeling of just feeling like this thing is calling me or I feel

83
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,550
safe here, but at the same time, I'm looking over every shoulder and not feeling like I'm safe.

84
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,050
So you might be better placed than anyone on understanding overcoming fear from nearly

85
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,009
drowning, terrified of water to putting yourself in the most extreme situations in the ocean that

86
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:11,230
anyone in the world is doing. What's the secret to overcoming fear? The secret I think is accepting

87
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,410
that you don't actually ever do. And I mean that in all sincerity, because the things that I have

88
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,810
done, like the levels I have pushed myself to as an individual to essentially overcome fear,

89
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,529
like surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing, surfing,

90
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,170
surfing jaws at night and things like that. I was essentially trying to, and I didn't know it at the

91
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,250
time, but I was trying to prove to that inner child that I'd gotten over this fear. And when

92
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,350
you do those things, you'd think you would be free. You'd think you'd, you'd finally have let

93
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,449
that go. And there were moments of that feeling, but then every time I'd try and ride a bigger

94
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:49,850
wave or take on a new task, I still felt those feelings of fear. And then I still heard those

95
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,529
little voices of doubt. But then as I broke down the process, I've understood that I'm not

96
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,430
understanding how I push through the barrier or limitations of fear. I found myself starting to

97
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:06,029
feel somewhat free and then feeling like a sense of, okay, there's a lot of possibilities here.

98
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,689
And then from that space, then I realized you don't ever really get over fear. You just accept

99
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,129
that it's part of the process and that you will break through to the other side at some point.

100
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,709
And that other side of it is where we can live at our highest level. And that's what I got excited

101
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,529
about. Because when I understood that, I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going

102
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,129
Like, I can share this with other people.

103
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,009
It's not just about riding big waves.

104
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,190
It's about understanding and acknowledging that every single person has that fear or

105
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,629
that little voice of doubt stopping us from doing things that we can do and that we have

106
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:42,149
to just understand that it is a process that we will break through, but it's also enjoyable

107
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,870
because when you break through it, you're living life on the highest frequency or vibration

108
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,970
and that's when it's like, this is amazing, you know, and that's the part that I love

109
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,429
the most.

110
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,309
There's an old saying, Mark, that was going through my head as you were talking there,

111
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,710
on the other side of fear and challenge is everything you've ever wanted in life and

112
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:04,850
it sounds to me that that's your life story, to push through this ultimate fear and now

113
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,610
you're someone that can mentor, you can ride big waves, you can teach people that other

114
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,350
parts of your life, you're always going to have that self-doubt and that fear, but to

115
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,509
face it, walk through it, never goes away is what you're saying, you're always going

116
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:18,409
to have to deal with it, but.

117
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,149
Yeah, and I think it's healthy.

118
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,149
There's been one time.

119
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,230
There's been one time that I didn't feel fear and I was at a place in South Africa

120
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,710
and we surfed this wave, it was a really big wave and that day was like 70 foot and we

121
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,970
went to another spot and it was about 50 foot and a friend of mine was doing an interview

122
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,649
for his sponsor and one of the other guys said to me, hey, do you want to just catch

123
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,309
a wave at this spot while your mate's doing this interview?

124
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,129
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I'll just, for sure, you know, give me one wave or something,

125
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,029
just something to do.

126
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:50,690
And I had two life jackets on because I was wearing his because he was doing his interview

127
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,409
and I was like, yeah, I'll just, for sure, give me one wave or something, just something

128
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,149
I thought, I'll just clip his on and that, which is over the top, right?

129
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,029
We didn't have inflation vests then, or that wasn't a thing.

130
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,289
It's just a normal standard jet ski life jacket.

131
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:04,590
And this guy towed me into this wave and it's about 50 foot and I went down it and I looked

132
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,129
down the line and I realized I was way too deep and I wasn't going to make it.

133
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:13,309
And because I'd been surfing something that seems so much bigger, I went, I'll just go

134
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:13,629
anyway.

135
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:20,049
And I didn't have that feeling of fear and I went it and ate shit so bad and got so hammered

136
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:21,049
and got so ragdolled.

137
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,029
And it was probably one of the worst wipeouts ever.

138
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,149
And I remember thinking to myself, if I ever don't feel fear again, that's not a good thing.

139
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,549
So I almost use it as a sense of heightened awareness.

140
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,850
And I just, the thing is, what I've learned is I don't want to be consumed by it.

141
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,509
Yes, it will be present, but I don't need to live in that state.

142
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,990
Like, you know, there's an elevated emotion and I'll call that fear.

143
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,830
I'll call it stress, whatever you want, but acknowledge it, work with it, but don't let

144
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,669
it consume you.

145
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,389
And that's, that's the little difference.

146
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:52,730
That's this change for me.

147
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,929
I love that you've put yourself into the most extreme situations, as you said, to prove

148
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,090
to that inner child that you could deal with that.

149
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,190
I mean, I've been to Jaws break, sat on the beach, by the way, Evan.

150
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:07,169
The idea of even being on a board out there is terrifying to me.

151
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,190
To do it at nighttime is beyond belief.

152
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,250
To catch a 40 foot wave, and I love how you talk about 50 foot, 40 foot, that's eight

153
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:20,529
story buildings, nine, 10, 12 story buildings of water that are simply terrifying.

154
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,090
You did that at nighttime.

155
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:23,950
How was the heart rate on that night?

156
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,649
I was so scared and the buildup to that, like I was so scared that my body was so

157
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:33,769
overwhelmed with fear that I could barely function.

158
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:40,870
Like I could barely stand up in a position without just feeling so like over overwhelmed.

159
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,190
And I literally had to use my own medicine, so to speak, like the things that I'd learned.

160
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,470
I remember when I was moving into position to catch a wave, I was so scared and nervous.

161
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,509
That I had to literally rewire the process of what I was thinking about because I was

162
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,789
triggering thoughts of what if you fall off and all this kind of stuff.

163
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,889
And I was literally trying to change that process in that moment while I was moving

164
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,549
towards it.

165
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,169
And it was so intense.

166
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,029
I've never felt so scared before in my life, but I remember my heart pounding that hard

167
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,450
that my eyeballs were pulsing with my heartbeat.

168
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:20,450
And I, and I still, to this day, I can't describe ever feeling so fearful, but, but at the same

169
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,370
time, there was, it felt like I'd said to myself, there's no other choice.

170
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,889
I look back on that experience and think maybe I didn't need to go that far and that hard

171
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:29,409
for sure.

172
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,929
And if I was advising someone else, I'd probably be don't, you don't need to do that.

173
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,269
But what I was really searching for and I didn't understand it was self-acceptance,

174
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:41,870
you know, and self-worth because that wasn't strong enough to identify some other things

175
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,590
that were going on.

176
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,389
And I reckon when I look back on it, I'm like, there were some key indicators that were very

177
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,370
obvious to me now that I'm like, right, there's a, there's a.

178
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,870
There's a person there that's so hell bent on proving a point that they probably don't

179
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,429
need to go to this extent to do it.

180
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:02,149
Another phrase in my mind, if you risk nothing, you risk everything as well too in life, don't

181
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:02,350
you?

182
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,289
And it's, it's like the idea of wrapping yourself in the corner and staying away from any danger

183
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,669
has some appeal to it, but that's not a life anyone wants to live effectively.

184
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,909
I mean, you're going to the other extreme and you've got some other big ideas.

185
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:19,970
I've seen vision of you pushing jet skis out the back of planes with parachutes attached

186
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,250
to them.

187
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,070
You skydiving out after them in the ocean.

188
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,330
What's that project all about?

189
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,210
Well, that one's a project called Operation Deep Blue.

190
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,870
And that was basically the biggest wave ever ridden to date is 86 feet at a place called

191
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,929
Nazare in Portugal.

192
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,309
And year after year, that place would always get the big, the big wave of water.

193
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,110
I don't know if you've seen it, but there's a little lighthouse.

194
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,470
I've seen it.

195
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:42,070
It's famous.

196
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,750
It's a beautiful image, isn't it?

197
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
The lighthouse off the coast of Spain.

198
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,970
Have you surfed that way?

199
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,409
I've surfed Portugal.

200
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:46,990
Yeah, I've surfed it.

201
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,190
Yeah.

202
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,570
So there's a little red lighthouse and it wraps off Portugal.

203
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,429
Huge mountains.

204
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,330
Kind of cliff thing.

205
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,429
And over and over, that wave has sort of dominated the big wave space.

206
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,950
86 foot's the record, isn't it?

207
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,269
The record.

208
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,350
And every time it'd be said, oh, this one's 100.

209
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,049
This one's 100.

210
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,330
But it always falls short.

211
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,870
And it made me think, there's got to be another place.

212
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,029
There's got to be another way.

213
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,429
And then so on my journey working with other individuals and helping other individuals,

214
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,669
I worked for some military groups.

215
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,590
And then I got introduced to a head admiral and basically said, can you tell me where

216
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,429
you tell boats never to go?

217
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,350
There's got to be somewhere.

218
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,789
There's got to be some areas somewhere that you're like, that's a spot that we don't want

219
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:26,169
to look at or there's been shipwrecks or something.

220
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:31,730
And anyway, long story short, I got access to some information and I found a few spots

221
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,669
that had potential sightings or readings of a 30 meter, 100 foot wave.

222
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,269
And then I had to wait years, like literally two years, for each one of those to light

223
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,470
up and then fly a reconnaissance plane or something or go out to sea in a boat to see

224
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,509
if they were actually real.

225
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,269
And a lot of them had cracks.

226
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,149
Crazy hazards, like rocks, like in front of them.

227
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,429
So when it broke, if you rode it, you'd get cheese grated, you know, or it'd just be a

228
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,110
suicide mission.

229
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,570
And some of them might have just not been real.

230
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,990
It could have been what's called a rogue wave.

231
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,450
So that was the thought was, is it actually real?

232
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,509
My thoughts were they might be in the surfing terms, it's called a fat burger, right?

233
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,629
It's the term of a fat burger is a wave.

234
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,870
It's so big and it just claps at the top and it doesn't really stand up top to bottom.

235
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,429
And it could just be this rogue kind of fat-ish wave, which isn't that appealing.

236
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,149
It's not appealing to ride.

237
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,090
And then there was one that stood out that actually looked like a top to bottom huge

238
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,450
wave.

239
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:31,009
And I waited and waited for the window to go to that.

240
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,929
And then I missed days that would have been pumping in other areas.

241
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,950
And, you know, and people would, friends at the time were like, well, why aren't you going

242
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,490
to that swell?

243
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,350
Or what are you doing?

244
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:45,090
And I was just so like interested in exploring and seeing what was real.

245
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,330
And I believe I've found one that does stack up.

246
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,250
The only problem is it's so far.

247
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,149
From land that when I first sort of thought how I'd get there would be to send a ship

248
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:59,750
out and it would be a four day trip because it's literally like, you know, 4,000 nautical

249
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,070
miles from land or a point of land.

250
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,269
But then someone was sort of saying, well, the forecast changed and, you know, you're

251
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,110
two days into that, you could keep turning around.

252
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:12,009
So the likelihood of you being able to time it would be pretty hard.

253
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,669
Almost, you know, you could be sailing around for years trying to, trying to get this.

254
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:20,210
So maybe you could fly a plane in, you know, like a strike mission and then parachute

255
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,649
everything into that location.

256
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,110
So then for me, like I've spent my life trying to overcome the fear of water and then I'm

257
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,870
just now figuring out how to skydive because I'm like, all right, that's, that's the way

258
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,350
to do it.

259
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,809
And then I'm just shitting myself all over again.

260
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,049
But I learned a lot, you know, so I'm going through the process and I must've been 20

261
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:40,129
skydives in just going, I hate this sport.

262
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,309
I don't feel safe.

263
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,590
I nearly crashed into like hangers and stuff coming down, landing.

264
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,509
And I was just over and over just going, I'm going back through it all again, the same

265
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,009
childhood.

266
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,269
Years, but I'm older and smarter and I'm learning what's happening and I'm seeing my

267
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,870
own flaws and then how to deal with it.

268
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:02,529
So that was really an absolute blessing because it was like, I'd, I got to go through it

269
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,670
again, but I was re-equipped with new tools.

270
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,890
And then that started the quest for learning, you know, like I went and worked with a lady

271
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,329
called Kate Reardon, different like healers in Ubud and Bali, all sorts of different people

272
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,690
from, you know, ladies that had spent, one lady spent 14 years studying one section of

273
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,130
the brain.

274
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,390
And I was really determined to figure out why is my body and mind doing certain things

275
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,670
and why am I feeling certain ways and how do I flip that around in an instant or is

276
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,190
it possible?

277
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,690
I just kept, because I was able to use myself as a real example.

278
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:41,230
And a lot of the time when I'd worked with say a psychologist or mindset coaches, they,

279
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:46,329
some of them would draw their conclusions from textbooks or from books or knowledge.

280
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,670
Whereas some of the really good ones had real life experiences.

281
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,309
Or lived out family experiences where they'd learned their craft.

282
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,829
And to me, that was more fascinating because I was like, that's a different level of learning

283
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:04,029
when your life or someone else's life is on the line that changes the way you make decisions

284
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,549
and textbooks won't give you that.

285
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,670
So that's what really drove that passion to want to go down there.

286
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:14,349
And that has made you the go-to person for the likes of 11 time surfing world champion

287
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:18,990
Kelly Slater and Simon Goodwin's a legendary AFL premiership player.

288
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,069
Yeah.

289
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:24,130
And had a remarkable time as coach of the Melbourne football club, broken records there.

290
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,809
And you've been in his corner.

291
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,470
What sort of advice are you giving to people at that level who know success, they know

292
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,029
themselves, what are you teaching them?

293
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,410
Well, first of all, I'd say I wouldn't be their go-to guy because there's so many people

294
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,750
they could go to, but definitely connected with them and was able to offer them some

295
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,170
advice.

296
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,849
And really, I guess for Kelly, it's like a sounding board, like the guy's an 11 time

297
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:48,450
world champion.

298
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,150
Already achieved so much, but there's another space that I paid a bit more attention to,

299
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,490
which is outside of the sport of surfing.

300
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,029
And I was able to offer a different insight, which I didn't think.

301
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,430
And I was definitely thinking to myself, how am I going to help a guy that's already so

302
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,970
accomplished?

303
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,130
But that's sort of what it was.

304
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,470
It was a different insight to a world that they hadn't seen.

305
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,970
And particularly with Simon Goodwin, Goody is now someone's great friend of mine.

306
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,430
Same with Kelly.

307
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,369
But when I first...

308
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,369
When I first started with him, the perspective that I had was so different from the one that

309
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:22,789
he knew.

310
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,329
And I thought, he's going to think I'm so far out there in what I'm thinking that he

311
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,170
might just go, this guy's batshit crazy.

312
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,450
And it might be too hard to relay the information.

313
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,109
But what I really work on and how I really help people is becoming the best version of

314
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:44,049
themselves, but stripping that back, pulling back layers of fear, which is also linked

315
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,309
really closely to ego.

316
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,890
And neither of these people had that.

317
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,349
But teaching them, because ego comes in two parts, not standing up when you should, and

318
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,609
then also blurting out when you shouldn't.

319
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,910
But both those two people were probably on the opposite side of that scale.

320
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,529
But understanding that and understanding the patterns of that and being able to share with

321
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,009
them a totally different insight was probably really refreshing.

322
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:11,509
And particularly for Goody, because in a world of footy, and you'd know this better than

323
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:15,109
anyone, you're surrounded by people that all understand the same things.

324
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,730
And when I come in, it's like, I'm not talking.

325
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,230
I'm not talking about anything that he knows, which is probably refreshing.

326
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:27,130
And I'm not giving him information based on previous football or those kind of experiences.

327
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,130
So it was really, he was able to kind of let his guard down for me to really help him.

328
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:38,269
But it was great because the Goody that I know today is a completely different guy to

329
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,789
the one that I met five, six years ago, because he works so hard.

330
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,109
And I threw things at him again and again and again.

331
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,630
And he, to his credit, he was the one that put in the work.

332
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,329
He was the one that said, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to try and work and change that.

333
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,529
And again, and he, he grew so much in such a short space.

334
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,589
And by the time they won the first flag in, I think it was 56 years or something, it might

335
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:07,750
be wrong, but about that kind of period, he was a different character.

336
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:12,950
You know, I'd talk to him to things that it would be embarrassing to say at first, you

337
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,470
know, talking about energy stuff, that's the space that I'd play in, you know, and it would

338
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,630
sound too like woo woo.

339
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,329
We're out there.

340
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:22,750
And, uh, he would then talk back to me in that way because he understood it.

341
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,230
And it was kind of funny because early days, you know, that, that, that the person I met

342
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,750
is different, is a different person now.

343
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,009
And even to see him cop criticism for things that he has nothing to do with, but how well

344
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:40,289
he's handled it and how, um, centered he's stayed through it.

345
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,569
And then, you know, being such a great role model to so many players.

346
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,950
And now he's really such a strong shining light in that space.

347
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:47,690
It's really,

348
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,049
really rewarding, you know, uh, but he's the one that deserves the credit for it because

349
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,049
he had to put in the work.

350
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,309
Yeah.

351
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:53,529
He's got great composure.

352
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,309
Goody, hasn't he?

353
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,509
He's been, you're watching him under enormous pressure.

354
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,009
He handles himself incredibly well and deserves the success.

355
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:00,849
It's been great.

356
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,150
So you said something fascinating about ego.

357
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,269
I just want to pick up on it.

358
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,670
It's resonating with me.

359
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,829
Two sides of ego.

360
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,890
You describe you either don't stand up when you should for your ego or you blurt things

361
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,950
out when you shouldn't.

362
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:12,809
Yeah.

363
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:13,589
What do you mean?

364
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,809
What do you mean by that?

365
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,349
It's well, in a sense, like there's, there's.

366
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,089
The fear of failure, right?

367
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,269
So there'll be the person where their ego gets in the way and says, no, no, you shouldn't,

368
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:24,210
you shouldn't be up there.

369
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,109
You shouldn't be leading from the front.

370
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,490
You just stay back here.

371
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:28,990
That is a form of ego too.

372
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:33,250
That is crushing you from the, the, the skills that you have.

373
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,250
You're suppressing something that you could.

374
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,069
So your ego won't let you be the person you are because you've framed yourself in a way

375
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,890
that you put a lid on yourself effectively.

376
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:43,329
Correct.

377
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:47,390
And then the other side of it is you'll project something because you're also fear.

378
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:47,710
Yeah.

379
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,950
The fear of not being something, not being enough.

380
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:53,470
So you'll see the egotistical person say, oh, I'm this, this, and this.

381
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,269
They're saying it because they're afraid that maybe I'm not.

382
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,529
Yeah.

383
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,750
And if I say this, that maybe everyone will believe me.

384
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,250
So both come back to the same person, the same, you know, but you've got to understand

385
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,369
that there's two parts of it.

386
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,450
And when you see that, you're like, ah, that's really interesting because then you can really

387
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,029
help someone.

388
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:13,529
But they, with everything and all the different people I've worked with over the years, awareness

389
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:13,910
heals.

390
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,869
So you have to be aware of it to even start healing yourself.

391
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,910
We always talk about that as a club, a self-awareness club, but you can't actually open your account

392
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,210
without self-awareness.

393
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,130
So I want to ask you this question.

394
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,849
You've had great success in so many areas of your life.

395
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,309
What does success mean to you?

396
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,309
Short answer, to be happy.

397
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:35,150
Because if you're happy, you're not hanging on to things or, oh, if only it was this,

398
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,970
or if only it was that.

399
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,990
If you can, at the end of the day, go big smile on your face and go, you know, it's

400
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,970
a good day, or I'm looking forward to doing this, that's got to be the trait of happiness.

401
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:46,849
And I think Fijians do it better.

402
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:51,609
You know, you don't have to spend long in Fiji to realize the secret to life is happiness

403
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:55,410
because they live that life all the time in a way.

404
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,529
And we all have these financial goals or all these other goals.

405
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,069
Yes, you can have them all too, but you've got to be able to enjoy the process.

406
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,170
So I think the secret to that would be able to be ultra present in every moment to, you

407
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,089
know, to like, if I look back at some of the things that I've done and go, oh, geez, that

408
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,069
was an amazing achievement.

409
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,190
What do I wish I could have done better?

410
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,650
The answer is always.

411
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,990
Being able to enjoy the process a bit more, you know, instead of being fearful of, is

412
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,470
that enough?

413
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,829
How will that be perceived?

414
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:27,549
Or, you know, the young version of myself, you know, if you could go back and talk to

415
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,549
him, the advice would be, mate, just enjoy every day of this and enjoy your failures

416
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,890
because from that is what you're going to learn to be that better version of you too.

417
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,910
And it's hard pill to swallow.

418
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,509
Yeah, Matt, we say the term a lot, success leaves clues.

419
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,769
And I love talking in these forums because, you know, your story is amazing.

420
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,089
And to me, of what you've been able to come and at the coalface of understanding fear is

421
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,569
such a fascinating term for me.

422
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,529
But we see these patterns around what different leaders look like.

423
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:57,589
And I want to ask you a handful of questions now.

424
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,329
And it probably comes back to what you said.

425
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,910
We talk about self-leadership.

426
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,009
That's hard to lead someone else without a sense of your own self-leadership.

427
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,289
What do you think about that?

428
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,369
100% spot on.

429
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,549
You know, you cannot like stand up and be a person that's, you know, projecting this

430
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,970
or that without having that inner self-worth and self-love.

431
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,269
And that's exactly right.

432
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,849
And that's what I could see.

433
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,970
That I lacked myself or, and I see it in a lot of leaders, you know, you've, and that's

434
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,490
what I specialize in helping people is getting that person to be the best version of them

435
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,789
first, because then you can integrate that into a team environment.

436
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,089
And without that, how do you expect others to believe you or follow you if you don't

437
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:33,789
believe in yourself?

438
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,710
Yeah, I love that you keep saying that, inspiring people to be the best version of themselves.

439
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,269
Comparison is the thief of joy, isn't it?

440
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,210
If we're comparing ourselves to someone else, it's a economy that is never going to work.

441
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,809
People like you are constantly onto being positive.

442
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,269
You've in the impact of others around them and they're really focused on that positive

443
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:52,609
impact on others in their environment.

444
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,670
How have you gone about that?

445
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,349
Look, I probably have to be honest and say there's times that I'll crack the shits too,

446
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:59,930
but that's the beauty of that too.

447
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,670
You know, just accepting being who you are, but I think it's just constantly looking for

448
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:10,029
that opportunity to say to yourself, is there an opportunity to grow here or are we capped

449
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:10,329
out?

450
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:15,789
Like these projects that I've worked on and the ones that I'm working on still, I won't

451
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:16,829
be afraid of.

452
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:19,789
It not going ahead as long as I've given it all that I've got.

453
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,349
But that's an interesting phrase right there, giving it all that you've got.

454
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,890
Because if you can walk off and go, okay, there's nothing else that can be done.

455
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,430
That is a question that lasted four years in the process of wanting to ride the world's

456
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,190
biggest wave at night because it failed so many times over and over.

457
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,890
And I used to climb up onto my roof because I trained at night at 12 o'clock because we're

458
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,049
riding out in the night to test this stuff out.

459
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,609
And I'd climb up on the roof because no one would hear me.

460
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:46,829
And I'd ponder like,

461
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,329
you know, what went wrong there?

462
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:48,970
What went wrong there?

463
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,250
And a lot of time I thought, I'm a nutcase.

464
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:52,930
I've gone too far with what I'm doing.

465
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,609
And I wasn't prepared to climb off the roof until I'd sort of decided, all right, is there

466
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:58,789
nothing else that can be done?

467
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,150
Like, is this project a complete flop?

468
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:05,769
But I always, when I asked that question, I always went, I haven't tried this.

469
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,789
And the depth of that question, man, that can span out a lifetime.

470
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,089
So you'd be prepared to answer it if you're going to ask it, I'll say.

471
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,789
You've had some big vision.

472
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:18,569
You've had some big visions to do some crazy things.

473
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,849
How have you gone about, you know, creating and sharing those visions with others to bring

474
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,349
them to life?

475
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,210
Transparency, I think.

476
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:28,069
Like to, to have visions and I never see them as crazy.

477
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,410
I see them as calculated and the process of, you know, minimizing fear in every single

478
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,269
element to make sure it can be done safely.

479
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,809
But to have someone else share that vision, you have to be really transparent.

480
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:43,029
You have to be so open because a lot of people would say, well, what does your wife think?

481
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,410
You know, how does, surely she's going to be freaking out by this side of things.

482
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:46,829
And I'm like, I don't know.

483
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:47,789
She doesn't.

484
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,950
And then if you ask why, it's because she knows what's going on.

485
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,410
She sees the level of training that we do.

486
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,789
She sees the information that's happening in the background.

487
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,529
She knows how, how hard we're working.

488
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,910
So when someone says, I bet you that's scary to her, she straight away knows they're minimized

489
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,529
fear and stress in those areas.

490
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,829
So that is not a high risk factor.

491
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,750
It's, it's 4%, 5%, you know, we've broken it down.

492
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,210
So when everyone in the team understands that process and we're all along for that journey

493
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:16,829
and we've, we all know that.

494
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,230
We all understand what we're doing and how we're doing it.

495
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,450
It's such a strong, united force.

496
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:22,269
It's hard to break.

497
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,470
And when you see a sporting team or a business group have that same level of understanding

498
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,450
together, that's a lethal force.

499
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,809
And you don't want to mess with someone like that because they will, they will take you

500
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:33,549
down every time.

501
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,809
I love you went straight to transparency, isn't it?

502
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:40,750
If you're completely 100% transparent with everyone and they understand that you're not

503
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,549
crazy, you value your life as much as everyone else.

504
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,930
Then I can understand that you've been able to break that down.

505
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,289
As you said.

506
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:49,069
So curiosity is a word that we see a lot.

507
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:53,349
And through curiosity, we see people like you are constantly learning and developing

508
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:53,829
themselves.

509
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,730
Does that resonate with you?

510
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,170
Yeah.

511
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:58,849
And I think you have to be, and that's also letting go of the, the ego.

512
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:04,730
Like at no point do I ever consider myself in a space where, you know, I've, I've learned

513
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,089
enough.

514
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,549
It's like, you've, you've always got to keep learning and whether that's being a better

515
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,910
father, um, friend, whatever that is.

516
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,170
And in, you know, we're always learning.

517
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,210
And you, I think the moment that you stop is probably when.

518
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,250
Um, when your time's up, because when you, if I think, if you think, you know, everything,

519
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,569
that's probably when you're going to get a pretty quick reality check.

520
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,049
You're a much sought after keynote speaker.

521
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,329
You've just come today from a presentation in front of 800.

522
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:29,970
Yeah.

523
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,549
I'd love to say I always dress like this, but.

524
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,650
I love how sharp you are, mate.

525
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,210
The surfer with the, uh, with the business attire.

526
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:37,170
Well, well done, mate.

527
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,250
You're making me feel, uh, decidedly underdressed, but, uh, how about you communicating with

528
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,569
clarity?

529
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:45,569
How's your strategy been on, on that communication style?

530
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:45,910
Yeah.

531
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,269
I think it's.

532
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:50,869
It's just being okay to be me, you know, sharing it in a way where I'm extremely vulnerable

533
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:56,089
about who I am, what I've done, my failures and, um, the process of how it was done.

534
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,609
And there's a real genuineness to share that with other people to help them connect to

535
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:02,529
the, the fact that they could do that too.

536
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,190
And that's, that's the point of it.

537
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,190
Being a keynote speaker is, is helping, uh, every single person in the audience be able

538
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,849
to understand that they can structure their life in a way to be the best version of themselves

539
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,250
and same with business groups and different organizations.

540
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:23,289
It's always, it's gotta be about, um, a story that is not necessarily, uh, about what it

541
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,309
seems like to start with.

542
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:25,930
You know, it's not about riding big waves.

543
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,289
That's the opening theme.

544
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,450
And that's what some of the visuals are an example of, but it comes back to the individual

545
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,009
that they can sit there and go, you know what?

546
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,250
I could probably step up what I'm doing a bit, you know, and there was a clear process

547
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,650
and path of how that was done.

548
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,009
Maybe I could do that too.

549
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,950
And that's, that's always what I want to achieve.

550
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,950
How important has collaboration been for you, Mark, in your life?

551
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,950
Um, I think.

552
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,509
You're absolutely screwed without it.

553
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:52,390
You know, I tried to do this project, the Knight Rider one in particular on my own for

554
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,809
three and a half years.

555
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,549
And it wasn't until I worked with a team that it quickly accelerated and it was done in

556
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,069
six months.

557
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,089
So I straight away knew as an individual, you can only do so much on your own and it

558
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,509
comes down to every single person being valued.

559
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,529
You know, no matter what role you play, every single person within the team is so crucial

560
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,210
because if you're missing those cogs, um, you know, straight.

561
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:20,910
You start to, you start to try and compensate for someone else, you know, and then you start

562
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,549
to overwork or you, you put yourself in a situation where you're not functioning at

563
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,309
a smooth level.

564
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,329
So it's so crucial to make sure that you have the right people in the right place.

565
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,710
And, uh, and without that, I just see it as being nothing really without the right people

566
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,569
around you and whether that be friends, mentors, whatever that is, even if you are an individual,

567
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,930
but you have to have the right people around you.

568
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,950
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

569
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,930
Tough question.

570
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,589
So many, so many inspirational people, um, early days.

571
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:54,609
So as a surfer, my manager is, uh, Pat Rafters, brother, Steve, who's Pat's manager.

572
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,349
And I was introduced to Pat at a young age.

573
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:02,410
And I remember asking Pat kind of like a young kid wanting to get a cheat sheet to life.

574
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,910
Okay.

575
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,990
How do I do this really well?

576
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,349
How do I get to where I want to get to?

577
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:10,970
And he took, he took me out for brekkie and he sort of said, you know, hard work, hard

578
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,410
work and more hard work.

579
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,430
And I was like, that is the shittest answer.

580
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,849
You know, young 20.

581
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,769
I could ever get.

582
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,269
And I'm like, so what about this?

583
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,710
And he, he kind of just looked at me like, you don't get it kid.

584
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,230
The reality is you've got to put in the effort.

585
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,410
And he's so right because when I was doing the things that I wanted to do, it wasn't

586
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,470
until I realized that I went into serious depth about how something would be done, that

587
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,769
the answers came and the process, you know, came together.

588
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,710
So, um, Pat's definitely been a big mentor in that space and his brother, Steve has been

589
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,910
to such level headed, uh, individuals, um, that have really helped me.

590
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,049
In that space.

591
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,829
And even the people that I work with, I, it's, it's almost like a two way street.

592
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:56,730
You know, I get to work with some amazingly talented humans and often, although I'm sharing

593
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,230
a different, uh, insight to what they're doing, I'm also very inspired by what they

594
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,650
do too.

595
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,690
Uh, so yeah, I'd probably be here name dropping and saying things all day long, which I don't

596
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,849
really need to do in a sense of the fact that the people around me that I'm involved with

597
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,910
and, uh, have been around, have been so inspiring to me in so many different ways.

598
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,309
Yeah, it's great that you've got that, uh, list to call on, isn't it?

599
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:22,710
In your life and you're, you're, you're blessed aren't you to be able to, and you're passing

600
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,190
that onto so many in your own authentic way, which is a brilliant story to hear.

601
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,930
We're, we're obsessed with collaboration, feel like the world descended into silos a

602
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,150
lot and we love the idea of connecting people and collaborating in the, in the work we do

603
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,970
in our leader space.

604
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,750
Has there been one person in these projects that you're undertaking or any part of your

605
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,849
life in so many different dimensions to you thought, God, I'd love to collaborate with

606
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:44,430
that person.

607
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,869
Is there a name that springs?

608
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,710
At this point, I'd probably have to say I've almost got the blinkers on.

609
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,609
Like I'm so entrenched in what I'm doing in the team that I'm involved with, but I, you

610
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:58,069
know, when I get a chance to look at other things, you know, I look at some of the formula

611
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,130
one teams and think, wow, look at the way they do things.

612
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,329
And some of the NFL teams, the process of how they do stuff.

613
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:05,750
I just think, geez, that's impressive.

614
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,769
And there are different groups that I'm super impressed by, and there'll be so much to learn

615
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:15,550
from, but I kind of think to myself, um, either it'd have to be the right time, you know,

616
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:15,909
and, uh,

617
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,929
and at the moment, cause we're so gung ho and finishing, um, the project that I'm doing

618
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:24,289
now, I've probably limited my ability to, to sort of span out in that space.

619
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,750
But yeah, I think it's something I've probably just got to be open to.

620
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,750
Yeah.

621
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,010
Well, Mark, I know I've learned an enormous amount from our chat today.

622
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,769
I think all of us have that level of fear and your ability to break it down in a way

623
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:38,610
to say it's always going to be there, but you can practically take steps through it.

624
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,929
