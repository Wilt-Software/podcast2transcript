A Listener Production.

2
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,710
G'day, it's Luke Darcy here.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,730
Welcome to the Empowering Leaders Podcast.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,469
It's the product of one of my oldest friendships.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,850
Matt Wadowicz and I started playing junior footy together

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,289
when we were 14 years old.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,390
He was the junior superstar of our team,

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,929
but when he shattered his ankle in our last game together,

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,550
it was me who went on to play AFL football for a living

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,270
while Matt became an incredible school teacher.

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,609
Matt's relentlessly authentic nature

12
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:40,770
was behind his refusal to allow a group of 25 kids

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,009
to be managed out of his school.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,049
He went to the principal and told him

15
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,789
that these kids were the reason why he became a teacher.

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,390
The story of how all these kids went from being out of the school

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,530
to successfully completing Year 12,

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,689
and many then on to further education,

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,990
captivated me.

20
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,850
As a father of four school-aged children,

21
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,869
the idea that our kids would have a voice

22
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:02,909
in their own learning environment

23
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,750
and that their teachers would collaborate,

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,030
share ideas and work together

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,590
on the best outcomes,

26
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,549
for everyone,

27
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,590
was a lightbulb moment for me.

28
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:11,609
A leader,

29
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,409
spelled A-L-E-D-A,

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,390
a misspelling of an old Scots word

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,250
meaning to guide,

32
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:16,829
educate,

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,530
teach,

34
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:18,689
and draw out information,

35
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,030
was born out of this.

36
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:21,170
Together,

37
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,129
Matt and I have had the great privilege of working

38
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,250
with thousands of leaders in education,

39
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:25,989
sport,

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,709
industry,

41
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:27,430
and the arts.

42
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,590
And the only place to start, really,

43
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,650
is at the beginning,

44
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,409
and I'm sitting across from one of my oldest friends,

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,230
Matt Wadowicz,

46
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:48,510
who I met,

47
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,250
I think,

48
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:50,670
at the age of,

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,489
I'm thinking 12 or 13,

50
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,209
at the South Adelaide Football Club.

51
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,989
Is that your recollection?

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,290
I think so, mate.

53
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,969
I remember meeting you at a game against Sacred Heart

54
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,150
and South Adelaide were playing against them.

55
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,750
And I remember when you arrived,

56
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,989
you stole my position, mate,

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,769
in the first game.

58
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,310
So I wasn't too happy with this big skinny fella

59
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,009
from Ross Trevor coming to play for us.

60
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,110
Well, and that was my recollection, mate,

61
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,330
speaking about leadership and empowering leaders,

62
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,210
that you were the captain of all our junior sides.

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,629
You were the best player in all our junior,

64
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:23,330
and I was the ring-in that was father-son,

65
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,750
because my dad played at South Adelaide.

66
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,770
So I was a private school boy coming down South

67
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,129
with all the tough lads from down South.

68
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,050
And I did take a few people's positions,

69
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,949
and that didn't go down that well, mate.

70
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,229
But you stood up for me at a young age,

71
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,189
and I never forgot that,

72
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,490
because you were in my corner,

73
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:42,009
and it never lost me that you were the person

74
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,789
that came and extended that hand of friendship

75
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,270
when others weren't prepared to do it.

76
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,849
I do remember it, mate.

77
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,849
And yeah, I remember it fondly.

78
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:49,610
And so,

79
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,530
I'm really glad I did, really.

80
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,849
I mean, I just,

81
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,889
I can remember thinking to myself,

82
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:55,469
you know,

83
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,310
he's definitely got more aggression than me,

84
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,830
and you just, you know, you did.

85
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,150
You had a lot more aggression than me.

86
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,550
It's a work in progress still, mate.

87
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,710
But yeah, I was a bit surprised,

88
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,349
because I didn't realise growing up down South,

89
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,810
the rivalry between Ross Trevor and Sacred Heart.

90
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:11,530
And I was wondering,

91
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,250
why is this guy so fired up?

92
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,930
And I just had to try and settle you down.

93
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,650
But I just love playing footy with you.

94
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,810
And I remember, you know,

95
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,150
I just had this sense you're going to be a good player.

96
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,030
And you hadn't put it all together.

97
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,370
You were still growing at that stage.

98
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,849
But I remember really making sure when I had the ball,

99
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,330
I'd kick it to you as much as I could

100
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,729
and trying to support you as much as I could.

101
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,449
And then it was just awesome for me to,

102
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,849
you know, when my journey ended with footy,

103
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,349
to be able to watch you continuously get better and better

104
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,430
and watch from afar.

105
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,810
And no, it was brilliant, mate.

106
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,250
We loved having you on board.

107
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,050
And yeah, been great mates ever since.

108
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,050
Yeah, it was a fierce school rivalry

109
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,189
and a great friendship, mate,

110
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,550
being able to come down and play,

111
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,770
with you and we played all the way through.

112
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,629
We ended up, you know,

113
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,530
playing our first games in league football

114
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,930
in South Australia with South Adelaide,

115
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,110
I think a couple of weeks apart from memory.

116
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,629
And it culminated in 1992.

117
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,189
You were drafted to the Bombers.

118
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,449
I was drafted under the father-son to the Bulldogs,

119
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,969
which was probably the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.

120
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,490
But unfortunately for you, mate,

121
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,349
now last game of South Adelaide,

122
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,090
you shattered your ankle horrifically

123
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,729
to the point where the Bombers thought

124
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,709
that it was a two-year recovery and didn't take you over.

125
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,329
But how hard was that on you?

126
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,610
Because it changed your life.

127
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,509
Pretty much from then.

128
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,089
Yeah, it was at the time.

129
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:25,029
I remember it's funny now because you feel so long ago

130
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,730
that you feel like it's a different lifetime.

131
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,110
But I do remember at the time really affecting me.

132
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,230
I remember being, you know, very flat

133
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,870
because, you know, for probably the five years

134
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,529
leading up to it, you felt like, you know,

135
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,910
potentially this could be my career.

136
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,769
This could be my life.

137
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,089
And it was those days where SADFL players

138
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,709
and I'm sure Waffle players were the same

139
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,569
is that you would go over and train

140
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,250
with the team that drafted you.

141
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,310
Yeah.

142
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,069
I remember getting drafted the first year

143
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,769
and actually staying home, which is unheard of now.

144
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,029
But a lot of us did do that.

145
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,649
And including yourself, I think, Darce.

146
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,029
But a lot of us stayed home that first year.

147
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,410
And, you know, I always had in my mind that I'd go.

148
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,110
But the experience of training at an AFL club

149
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,269
over that pre-season, really just amazing.

150
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,730
And you just think, you know, this is going to happen.

151
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,569
This is going to be great.

152
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,089
So you almost get a taste of it and then it's taken away.

153
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,709
So I do remember dwelling on it for a few months.

154
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,910
But it's probably with me not so much in my nature

155
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,009
to continue to dwell on that.

156
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,470
I recognise that, you know, that door is closed for me.

157
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,649
Gave it a little bit of a go to come back,

158
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,949
but it didn't quite work out.

159
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,189
I remember you coming back from your first training session

160
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,709
at the Bombers.

161
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,990
We were desperate to make it in the AFL

162
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,529
and you'd done a weight session with the great Paul Salmon

163
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,889
and you were full of life and full of stories, as you said.

164
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,870
And you were, mate, I've said this very often,

165
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,870
a star player and athletically gifted.

166
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:47,069
Unfortunately, that recovery meant that that chapter was closed.

167
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,170
But I often tell this story.

168
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,829
You went to teachers.

169
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,269
You went to college, which is where our paths crossed again

170
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,209
and became a legendary teacher in South Australia.

171
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,110
And I remember, you know, we stayed in touch

172
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,569
and you're a great friend connecting all the way through

173
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,610
whenever you came to Melbourne.

174
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,069
But I'd occasionally hear the stories of a friend of a friend

175
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,089
or someone I knew ended up in Matt Waterwitz's class

176
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,810
and that it was a life-changing experience to be in your classroom.

177
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,850
And I know you're probably humble enough not to want to go too far into that,

178
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,850
but you clearly had a passion for being a teacher.

179
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,629
And you were clearly really good at it.

180
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,189
Yeah, it's funny.

181
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,490
I think when you reflect on it,

182
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,389
I reckon the original idea for getting into teaching

183
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,089
was the idea that I could do PE

184
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,449
and that I could have 12 weeks a year holiday.

185
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,850
So I think if I search really honestly in myself,

186
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,569
that was the reason.

187
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,470
But I remember in my last year,

188
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,110
and I still, you know, probably not dismissing the fact

189
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,110
that I really love working with kids.

190
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,370
But in my last year, I remember doing this presentation.

191
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,449
It was my final presentation at university

192
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,129
and it was about accountability.

193
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,889
And, you know,

194
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,689
you're going out in the world to become a teacher.

195
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:54,069
What's the most important things in terms of accountability?

196
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,410
And there's so many things you're accountable for.

197
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,050
You know, you're accountable for the students in your care.

198
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,589
You're accountable for the teachers around you,

199
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,629
the school values.

200
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,529
You're accountable to the Department of Education.

201
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:05,069
You're accountable.

202
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,329
And I remember this.

203
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,930
I remember thinking, I've nailed this presentation.

204
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:09,829
Like, this is great.

205
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,230
I'm going to get some great responses here.

206
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,589
I'll get a good score and away we go.

207
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,050
I finished.

208
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,370
And luckily for me,

209
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,709
or luckily for me in that,

210
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,089
my lecturer at the time was away.

211
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,550
And a philosophy major PhD doctor came in

212
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,970
and he was looking after our class that day.

213
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,149
And I'd finished my presentation sitting down,

214
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,230
feeling good about myself.

215
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,269
And he said, Matt, I've got a concern for you here.

216
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,990
And he said, I think if I was a teacher sitting in this room right now,

217
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,829
I'd be thinking, why the hell am I going to be a teacher?

218
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,410
Because you've just told me about all these terrible things

219
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,350
that I now need to worry about.

220
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,689
So think about the list now, Matt.

221
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,449
And you tell me,

222
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,269
what is the most important thing you're accountable for as a teacher?

223
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,509
And of course, there's a long silence and a big pause by me.

224
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:55,649
And I'm thinking through the list

225
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,870
and I'm thinking about all this stuff that I've just covered,

226
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,329
wondering what is it?

227
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,290
And of course, you know, you come straight back to it.

228
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,930
It is actually, you're accountable to the kids in your care.

229
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,750
And so that was big for me because I just thought, right,

230
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,949
if that's true, then I've got to get bloody good at this job.

231
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,050
So I can't really just think about the 12 weeks of your holidays

232
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,649
and kicking the footy with the kids out in the oval,

233
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,389
which is my original intention.

234
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,589
I've actually got to really take this seriously.

235
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,009
And that way you really enjoy it because it's part of your value.

236
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,350
So that's how I got into that.

237
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,410
There's around 25 kids, I understand,

238
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,470
were troubled and having challenges at school.

239
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,850
And schools traditionally manage kids out of school

240
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,990
who maybe aren't living up to the standard.

241
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,769
You're at a Cardone College on the McLaren Vale of South Australia

242
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:46,330
and some of those kids are probably going to get exited out of the school in year 10.

243
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,610
And you go to the principal and you say,

244
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,889
I became a teacher for these kids.

245
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,029
Give me these kids.

246
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,490
But there was a couple of conditions.

247
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,429
Can you pick up the story and tell us what happened?

248
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:55,090
Yeah.

249
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,590
Originally, I was a bit challenged by it because I just had this belief

250
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,490
that every classroom teacher should be integrating

251
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:04,129
and finding opportunities for those kids.

252
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,889
And I was sort of diametrically opposed to getting them out of class at the start.

253
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,590
But when I really realised that they were going to be turfed out,

254
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,990
I just came up with some alternatives.

255
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,309
And I got together with a great mate of mine,

256
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,149
who's now working with us, DAS, Damien Hill.

257
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,350
And we came up with this concept of masterclass,

258
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,190
which is this fully integrated rich task scenario

259
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,269
where the kids would be immersed in deep learning for each term of the year.

260
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,470
And the way that we tapped into the interest of the kids is,

261
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:39,549
day one, we brought them down to a beach.

262
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,570
They didn't know what was going on.

263
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,070
They just knew they were going to be immersed in this learning experience for the year.

264
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,049
And we took them down to the beach down at Somerton in South Australia.

265
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:51,009
And the way we launched it with them is we said approximately 40 years ago,

266
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,809
and I thought they had the exact date of the time.

267
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:58,950
And I said, there was a body here that was a dead body was found here on the beach.

268
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,230
And to this day, no one knows exactly what happened.

269
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,669
And it's a true story.

270
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,669
And now it's been in the media this year a lot, actually,

271
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:10,789
because I've tapped into some DNA stuff about this body.

272
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:16,029
But we gave the job to the students to help us solve the mystery of the Somerton Man.

273
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,230
The unknown, the unknown grave.

274
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,029
And yeah, we got them to, as part of this learning experience,

275
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,370
we got them to interview past detectives that worked on the case.

276
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,429
We got them to write letters to the editor.

277
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,850
We got them to do mathematical equations because there was a code that was linked to this story.

278
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,870
In this case, we got them to do presentations to their parents.

279
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,929
Yeah, the results were fantastic for these, for these boys.

280
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,049
Incredible story.

281
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:45,929
There's a theory that the Somerton Man potentially was a Russian spy who washed

282
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,710
up on Somerton Beach in South Australia.

283
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,330
He'd been almost surgically scrubbed, we understand.

284
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,049
And all the tags on his clothes removed.

285
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,049
And some of the markings were Russian tattoos.

286
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,230
And as you said, in recent times, the body's been exhumed.

287
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,549
There's such a fascination with it.

288
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,950
I believe you've got the old detective who was obsessed with the case back to speak to the kids.

289
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,870
So these kids have gone from being disengaged in their learning.

290
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,830
You've come up with a fairly random way to integrate it.

291
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,490
And all of a sudden, they're writing letters to the editor.

292
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,570
They're engaged in class.

293
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,649
And that group in year 10, from really maybe being out of the school, I understand every

294
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,269
one of them went on and finished year 12.

295
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,309
And a big portion of them actually then got to tertiary education after that.

296
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,870
Yeah, we had some great results.

297
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,309
And I guess the immediate impact we saw was attendance rates going up and behavior issues

298
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,049
was the big one going straight down.

299
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:38,830
And just the fact that some of the boys in particular were not attending.

300
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,490
And all of a sudden, they're writing me emails on the weekend saying, I've got another theory.

301
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,389
I've got another theory.

302
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:43,450
Mr. Man.

303
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,549
I've got another theory.

304
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,809
This is what I think's happened.

305
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,970
And even this is going back a number of years now, but as these stories have been unfolding

306
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,629
in the South Australian newspapers recently, I got an email from one of the old boys that

307
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:57,669
went through this program.

308
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,269
He said, Mr. Woodhouse, I thought we solved it.

309
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,009
What's the problem?

310
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,330
But it's great that we had that experience with the boys.

311
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,470
You being who you are, then said to the principal in the school, I'm handing these boys back

312
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,450
into the system next year, but I'm only doing it if you allow me to.

313
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,850
I'm only doing it if you allow me to help coach the teachers on how to engage these

314
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,509
boys properly.

315
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,370
And that is why you and I are sitting across from each other today.

316
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,669
It's where this whole story starts.

317
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,970
Can you talk about what you did and where that's gone?

318
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,110
The story of the summited man was great because it engaged people, but I knew it would only

319
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,730
last if teachers picked up and run with it.

320
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:36,570
And to their credit, the way they collaborated with us and took up this advantage to all

321
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,509
of a sudden for young Jimmy to want to write an essay about a topic that maybe wasn't part

322
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,009
of the syllabus.

323
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,409
But it's actually part of, you know, still doing the skills of essay writing, but now

324
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:48,450
it's about the summited man.

325
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,409
To their credit, they picked that up and they started really working and collaborating together.

326
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:57,429
And so I started to understand like the real power of me making a change was not just me.

327
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:02,110
It actually was all about the way that I'd construct the conditions where teachers were

328
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,830
working together.

329
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,049
And when I was asked to, you know, and work with my principal at the time, who was brilliant

330
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:12,809
at supporting me, to try and work out what's going to be the best way to coach teachers.

331
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:17,470
And how can I convince teachers that, you know, to ask what it's like that in education

332
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,950
that, you know, teachers are often in their classroom by themselves and they're given

333
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,429
that responsibility from such a young age and often the walls are shut, the doors are

334
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:27,690
shut.

335
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,470
So how do you create the conditions where you're breaking that down and trying to make

336
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,509
sure that they know you as a coach, you're in their corner and you're trying to best

337
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,990
support them because you know that they've got a really difficult job and it's incredibly

338
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,509
important.

339
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:48,690
And you ended up, I think people in education, I've been on this journey with you and I wish

340
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,330
they'd in touch.

341
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,250
I love the stories, you know, as a father of four myself and school age kids, you can

342
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,450
see the difference in their world when you have an engaged teacher and someone they connect

343
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,769
with, their life is just full of, you know, learning and excitement.

344
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,210
And when they're not so attached to a teacher, you could see what happens with, you know,

345
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:08,830
kids that were pretty otherwise happy.

346
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,350
So John Hattie is someone educators know a lot.

347
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,210
He's a professor of education.

348
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,990
He's currently at Melbourne University, but he was previously University of North Carolina

349
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,070
and also University of Auckland.

350
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:26,450
And he's known, Matt, for undertaking the largest ever meta-analysis into what effective

351
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,529
education looks like.

352
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,950
And, you know, without sort of stealing your thunder, I understand that he talks about

353
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,149
teachers first, second and third, the answer, good teachers.

354
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,450
So you can have a building that's been built for $50 million, the best new branch banking

355
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:41,809
library.

356
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,210
Excise is almost zero with that library, unless you fill up with great teachers.

357
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:50,590
And even greater than that, when you get teachers collaborating together, that's been shown

358
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,370
through his meta-analysis to work.

359
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,009
And he heard about you, heard about what you were doing, and, you know, maybe you can explain

360
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:57,590
what happened there.

361
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,450
Yeah, it was great to ask.

362
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,389
In Australia now, we have the AITSL standards, so the Australian Institute for Teaching and

363
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,970
School Leadership.

364
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,610
And teachers in Australia can now be judged, I guess, by criteria or standards in terms

365
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,289
of the way that...

366
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,110
They're impacting kids in the classroom, with the whole concept of we want to try and keep

367
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,870
great teachers in the classroom, and we want to try and increase their capacity and have

368
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,330
opportunities for them to develop.

369
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,769
And I went through the process.

370
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,669
When I was going to be a coach, I thought, well, I better know about these standards.

371
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,970
Managed to get myself certified as lead, which is the highest level.

372
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,509
And, you know, it was a funny story that I think is funny.

373
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,169
I had to present to a group of teachers who were going through certification.

374
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:40,710
I was one of the first that did it.

375
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:41,669
And I was talking about...

376
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,309
You know, I was a classic tall poppy, and some of my workmates were giving me a hard

377
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,149
time about certification.

378
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,789
And at that stage in South Australia, there was only about three or four teachers that

379
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,250
had been certified as lead.

380
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,769
And we had a consultant come out to the school saying, you know, we're thinking that the

381
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,529
next principal of this school will be certified as lead.

382
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,389
And everyone in the room knew that I was the only one in Catholic education in South Australia,

383
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,330
so they all looked at me and just started paying me out.

384
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,250
I was going to be the next principal.

385
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:11,090
And then all the payouts came through.

386
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,990
But when I was doing this story to the group of certified teachers, the CEO of AITS all

387
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,970
the time was in the room and liked my speech.

388
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,129
I didn't realise that later that day when she called me up on the phone to reflect on

389
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:28,970
that and how the process was for me and what I gleaned out of it, that John Hattie was

390
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,029
sitting in the car on speakerphone listening to my responses and taking note.

391
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,009
And I talked quite honestly about what I thought about the process and how it changed me as

392
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:40,049
a teacher, but also the bits I didn't like.

393
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:40,250
Yeah.

394
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,490
I appreciated that.

395
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,509
So they got me along to be on part of the teacher expert standing committee for Australia

396
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,210
for a couple of years.

397
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,230
So it was a real honour.

398
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,909
But you're right, Darce.

399
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,690
He was great at just cutting through stuff with the research saying it's all about the

400
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,009
teacher.

401
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,509
It's all about the way they collaborate.

402
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:58,850
It's not about the ego.

403
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,690
It's not about other things that we get distracted by.

404
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,569
And so that was really affirming to me that I was on the right track with the way I was

405
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:05,890
coaching.

406
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,250
So you built this model on the back of that, which initially called the Leadland Cycle.

407
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:10,890
It's been...

408
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,490
Rebranded to a leader, A-L-E-D-A, in recent times.

409
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,269
But effectively, we actually survey the kids in the classroom on their own learning environment.

410
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,869
And you think that, to me, would seem like an obvious thing, isn't it?

411
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,589
Let's listen to the people who we're trying to teach.

412
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,230
Not really done before, regularly.

413
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,670
And then getting these teachers to collaborate.

414
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,349
And I was just so inspired, mate, by getting a call from you.

415
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,670
You live in a beautiful part of the world, McLaren Vale, but you could be in the Barossa

416
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,670
and you'd be on the phone.

417
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,309
You'd be going, mate, I've just walked out of a year four classroom.

418
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,069
You're not going to believe what this is.

419
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,009
What are these teachers doing?

420
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,529
You can't...

421
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,470
This story, we need to capture it.

422
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,650
And I just kept thinking, God, imagine all the great teaching ideas and teaching practice

423
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,529
that's gone because no one shared it.

424
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,630
No one had collaborated.

425
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,630
We can all think of a great teacher that had an impact on our lives.

426
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,150
And great teachers change your lives.

427
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,470
We don't celebrate them enough, in my mind, in Australia.

428
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:01,769
What do we need to do that more?

429
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,950
I got through our process to go back to meet Peter Muddy Waters, who inspired me in year

430
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,369
four.

431
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,309
And amazing teacher, Tim Hart.

432
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,730
And in year 12, Ancient History, that had a huge impact.

433
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,670
So can you share with us stories where you've sat in classrooms and you've gone, God, we

434
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,569
need to share this.

435
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,369
We need to get teachers collaborating more.

436
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,430
Yeah, absolutely.

437
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,809
I mean, there's so many.

438
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,349
I'm really blessed.

439
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,349
I'm genuinely humbled by some of the teachers that are working in our schools.

440
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:32,430
And when you create the conditions where they're happy for you to sit in that classroom and

441
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,450
they're in your corner, you see some great things.

442
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,609
And one little example is when I first started this work, I remember going to a reception

443
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:38,930
class.

444
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,809
And it's actually in Old Norlunga in South Australia.

445
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,710
And I remember the teacher there taking the feedback from reception kids, you know, which

446
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,170
is staggering that they're even listening to the kids.

447
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,710
And I love that, that they're just not dismissing what the little ones are thinking.

448
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,690
Because, you know, they've got an opinion and they've got some thoughts.

449
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,670
And if you're smart about the questions you're asking them, you can actually get some real

450
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,869
insights into how they're going and how they're perceiving things.

451
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:07,150
But this teacher reflected, you know, with our feedback as well and just said, you know

452
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,349
what?

453
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,869
I think I'm being really much, 100%.

454
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,849
I'm teacher driven and I'd just love to hear some more of their voices sometimes.

455
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:19,250
And I think I can probably construct situations where they're actually engaged and really

456
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,829
having a greater level of involvement.

457
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,930
And so she she organized these little groups and pods of three or four kids and she she

458
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,410
worked out one person was going to be the leader and asking the questions and someone else

459
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,650
was going to make sure that someone was everyone was getting a turn.

460
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,930
And she just within a week had constructed this incredible learning experience and I was

461
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,289
just blown away.

462
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,710
Blown away by how amazing these kids were and how engaged they were.

463
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,670
And she was just sitting back just saying, like, this is a massive risk for me.

464
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,329
Like, you don't understand.

465
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,970
Like, I've never taken this much of a risk and I'm just so glad that it's working so

466
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,289
well.

467
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:00,529
And you almost get a tear in your eye when you see how pleased she is to be so, you know,

468
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,910
get someone in their corner and be reflective and just really change those, the outcomes

469
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,089
for those kids in the class.

470
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,910
And that's where, you know, the passion kicked in big time.

471
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,269
Is there anything more important?

472
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,529
And then us creating better environments for our kids and their education.

473
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,910
And I used to love, used to send me in the early days, a newsletter.

474
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,950
And so I have, this is principals taking us on and look at the front page of the newsletter.

475
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,569
And I used to complain sometimes most of the ones I would, we'd be telling us not to park.

476
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,670
And I felt like I was in trouble again, reading the newsletter from school sometimes, but

477
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,490
I'll paraphrase, but it was something like, I just want to write to the community and

478
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,430
tell you that we're surveying your kids on their learning environment.

479
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,269
Our teachers are undergoing a self-reflective practice on their own.

480
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,190
Learning journey, they're collecting that data.

481
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,670
They're working together to create better outcomes for the community and your kids.

482
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,470
I was like, that's what I want to hear.

483
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,289
I want to hear that everyone's on this learning journey.

484
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,829
And it just, it sounds simple what you've been able to do, but you've seen the transformation

485
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,509
in schools.

486
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:02,289
It's just, it's had a phenomenally positive effect on the places that you've been in.

487
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:03,730
Yeah, it is.

488
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,450
Uh, that's great.

489
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:04,890
Thanks, mate.

490
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,769
It's, it's brilliant to reflect on and, you know, I knew from the outset it needed to be simple.

491
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,190
Um, then there's gotta be, you know, if you understand something, well, you know, the

492
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,309
quote, you've, you've got to be able to simplify it and the concept of, you know, getting some

493
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:23,289
feedback, being curious, collaborating with others around you, being open that, you know,

494
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,130
no one's perfect.

495
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,430
You know, that's really part of this is to say no one's perfect.

496
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,410
It's a tough job, but, uh, we get so tied up in the next thing we have to do.

497
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,650
Sometimes we forget about how we're doing it.

498
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,269
And what are those strategies that we can harness from others that are going to make

499
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,650
our work more impactful?

500
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,529
And better for us.

501
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,009
And we can enjoy our jobs more, which I love those hacks that they shared within those

502
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,769
sessions that, uh, teachers can, can glean from each other.

503
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,670
Now the passion started in education, uh, Matty, but I've got to move to where it did

504
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,089
in our love of sport.

505
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:58,789
That's where we met, you know, 12 or 13 years of age at South Adelaide and, and clearly

506
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,809
onto AFL football in my journey.

507
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:06,109
But you've, uh, had that enormous passion for sport and, and the great part about the

508
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,730
coaches in 2020 and 2021.

509
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,549
And, and in recent times.

510
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:12,289
Is that they see themselves as educators more than ever.

511
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,690
They want to be better teachers.

512
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,069
They're open to feedback.

513
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,950
In fact, they're probably the most open group that you'd meet in the community.

514
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,430
And so we, uh, we started knocking on some doors in the world of sport and every second

515
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,690
week, I saw you in a different top, you're at the GWS giants one week, you're at Adelaide

516
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,470
Crows, the AFLW and the, uh, the Crows team.

517
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,910
You work with Luke Beveridge at the Bulldogs, Damien Hardwick at the Tigers, spent a lot

518
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,809
of time at Essendon who drafted you, which was fantastic to come full circle and work

519
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,369
with John Worsfold.

520
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:39,470
And.

521
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:44,630
His team and the handover to Ben, uh, Rutton now in the NRL, the Sydney Roosters and Trent

522
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,589
Robinson's incredibly successful team.

523
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,289
So it'd been remarkable to see how well that same cycle that you use in education, you

524
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,690
know, tailored a little bit to sport has been incredibly well-received.

525
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,750
Yeah, it was, it was fascinating, Darson.

526
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,990
Um, you know, I just had that hunch, you know, after doing it a number of times in schools

527
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,789
and getting such great feedback from, from an industry in an environment that is really

528
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,309
devoid traditionally of feedback.

529
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:09,529
Yeah.

530
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:16,250
education's improving a lot now. So I don't want to say that it's not, but if you compare it to

531
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,529
the world of elite sport, very devoid of feedback. So it was a challenge. And to get such good

532
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,930
responses, I was curious as to whether this would apply because I knew some of the great coaches I

533
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,970
had were great teachers and some of the great teachers I had were great coaches. And I was

534
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,609
wondering whether this would impact in the same way. And as you alluded to, what surprised me the

535
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:44,109
most is just how genuinely reflective and open the coaches in the AFL and in sport in general,

536
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:50,470
in regard to how can they best transmit information to players? How can they create

537
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,710
the conditions for learning? And how can they genuinely impact their performance? Because

538
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,430
they're given feedback from such a young age, as you know, and that really just sets them up for

539
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,029
this ability to be able to fast track any of the learning that I could bring to them, which was

540
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,369
great. Now, we're going to name drop here a little bit, mate,

541
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,589
because-

542
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:12,690
Because it has been quite an extraordinary story over the last six years. In recent times,

543
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:20,230
this process now from lead learn to a leader has passed its sixth birthday, but COVID hits,

544
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:27,130
hard to get into sporting organizations. But like a lot of people did, went to the online world and

545
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,529
you started the Australian Coach Symposium. I hope you can share some stories because the

546
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:36,230
Australian Coach Symposium had Don Pike, who's legendary West Coast Eagle and Adelaide Crows

547
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,430
coach, Justin Lang, the Australian.

548
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:43,730
Trent Robinson, who's a multiple premiership coach in the NRL. Matt King, who's a Melbourne

549
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,970
Storm legend and assistant coach as well to Trent Robinson. Ben Rutten is now at the Bombers. John

550
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,849
Wurstfold, Will Weaver has ended up at the Houston Rockets. So that group together through the COVID

551
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,089
period, right in the middle of their season in stressful times, decided that they wanted

552
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:02,549
you to facilitate a learning environment for them. Can you tell us how that experience has been?

553
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,390
Yeah, it's been amazing. And it came about through, you know, as a lot of these things do,

554
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:13,910
necessity because I was just driven to, you know, Essendon Football Club and the Sydney Roosters

555
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,390
had paid me some money, you know, to support the learning of their coaches. And so we had

556
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,369
organized an online learning environment for just their coaches individually with the Bombers.

557
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:32,049
But I knew that with Truck and Woosha, and then with Trent and also Kingy, that we weren't doing

558
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:37,349
them necessarily enough service there and we needed to extend their thinking. And so I started

559
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,430
to generate this idea of the collaboration. And then I got Pikey involved because he wasn't

560
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,990
coaching that year and he's good mates with Justin Langer. And we created, I'd come across

561
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,569
Will Weaver at the Sydney Kings. I'd been referred to him or he'd been referred to me, sorry, through

562
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:56,470
meeting at the Giants. And we put them together. And my concept was about, once again,

563
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,470
acknowledging that no one's perfect. Let's talk about what our strengths are and let's learn from

564
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,950
each other's strengths. And let's address what our greatest concerns are in terms of being a coach and

565
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:13,049
how can we support each other with that. And it's been an amazing, amazing group. So much so it was

566
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,869
meant to be an eight-week program and we've been going now, I think it's for about 18 months in

567
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:21,829
there. We still meet every fortnight and, you know, it's been an incredible example of that

568
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:25,910
collaborative learning. So these are highly successful people at the peak of their powers,

569
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:31,509
choosing to jump out, you know, with incredibly time poor, but, you know, the Australian cricket

570
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:36,130
coaches flying all around the world or even in COVID, they've got enormous amount of pressures

571
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,750
they are valuing, you know, jumping out even, you know, mid-test match. I want to get on and I want

572
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,049
to, you know, have this reflective practice with a group of my peers at the same level.

573
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:49,950
What are some of the things that you've seen firsthand? Because you've had this,

574
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,150
you've been flying the wall and facilitating and doing a great job in facilitating these

575
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,849
conversations. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sometimes it can be as simple as little hacks in terms of,

576
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:04,130
you know, time management things that they share and little mantras that they use or

577
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,890
strategies they've got to make decisions.

578
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,829
Lots of those little hacks that they can all draw from, but sometimes it's even bigger than that.

579
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,690
You know, it could be that, and without the dropping the names, but you can imagine the

580
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:21,210
scenarios where a coach has just come online and after a really tough loss, you know, just

581
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,190
a soul destroying loss as a coach, you put everything into it. And then questioning quite

582
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,470
openly to the colleagues in our room, in our group, as you say, your peers and say, what do I do?

583
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,529
Like, this has been terrible. How do you guys relate?

584
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,710
I don't feel like my players have stepped up. I don't feel like they're delivering what they need

585
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,349
to deliver. And then, you know, someone else in the group will just, will say something. And this

586
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:51,329
is a real example of something that was said is, have you found a way to love every one of your

587
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:56,630
players? And just, there's this great pause and the other coaches are thinking like, you know,

588
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,029
what a great question, you know? And I reflect back as a teacher, having some of those kids

589
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:06,069
that you talked about, Dar, sometimes they're pretty tough to love, but you've got to find

590
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:06,930
that thing about them. And I think that's a great question. And I think that's a great question.

591
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,650
That makes them great and try and bring that out. And the feedback from the coach afterwards was

592
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,869
like, that is exactly what I needed to hear. Like, you know, you've made my day. Like I just,

593
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,589
that's exactly what I need to hear. I decompressed. I feel like I've got, you know, I feel like I can

594
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:29,369
go back tomorrow and I know my path's clear. I can now, you know, put that into action.

595
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,750
So there's some examples of the types of things that are discussed.

596
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,789
And I love it, mate. It's what inspires me and, you know, the passion and purpose that

597
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,990
I've got around this is that, you know, I played in an era where there was no collaboration. There

598
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,869
was no opportunity to do that. And in fairness to those coaches, they did the best they could

599
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:51,210
with their level of learning, but it was, you know, the one stick, which was, you know, probably

600
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,690
abuse and attack and see if you were strong enough to survive. And, you know, for some people that

601
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,250
worked, but for a lot of didn't. So to see, you know, the opportunity to be able to find ways and

602
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,589
learn from people who are in the arena at the moment, who are doing, you know, these things

603
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,670
high level. So the opportunity, that's what excites me to be out. And that flows, you know,

604
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,710
to me down to junior level, because a lot of, you know, you and I spent a lot of time at junior

605
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,970
sport and you just see people coaching like a video I saw from 1960 of John Kennedy screaming

606
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,869
at his head and said, probably not appropriate for 10 year olds. You know, we could probably

607
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:36,150
do that a little bit better and you can have a really amazingly powerful impact. The word got

608
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:42,309
out, Matty, and other coaches have been, you know, organically coming a leader's way. And you've got

609
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,009
now another group.

610
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,269
Paul Postacoglu is an incredible story. He's just signed as the first Australian to coach in the

611
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:53,329
Scottish league. The famous Celtic club having won a premiership in Japan. Neil Craig, legendary

612
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:59,950
Australian coach, former Crows and legendary in the world of exercise science. Eddie Jones is

613
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,630
coaching English rugby. Brian Gorgian, the current Australian basketball coach. And Luke Beveridge

614
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,309
is an old mate of mine, but incredible coach of the Bulldogs. So these other pods are popping up

615
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:11,990
of collaboration.

616
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:12,809
Yeah.

617
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:12,829
Yeah.

618
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:12,849
Yeah.

619
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:12,869
Yeah.

620
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:12,890
Yeah.

621
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:12,910
Yeah.

622
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:12,930
Yeah.

623
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:12,950
Yeah.

624
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,970
Yeah.

625
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:12,990
Yeah.

626
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,230
Yeah.

627
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,829
All of it. You're facilitating it. I know your eyes occasionally pop out. You go, you're

628
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:19,250
not going to believe what I'm hearing. It's been incredible, isn't it?

629
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,329
It has been amazing. I mean, it probably goes back to your previous point about in your

630
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,970
day, you know, there wouldn't have been that collaboration. I do, this is one I can definitely

631
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,049
share with you is that I got with the Australian Coach Symposium, the second group you're talking

632
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,789
about. There was a moment where we did reflect on the power of the collaborative learning

633
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:43,089
a couple of weeks ago. And Neil Craig did say, look, I really wish that I had this type

634
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:48,730
of forum when I was the coach of the Adelaide Crows. I've just, I've found it so affirming.

635
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:54,289
I've found it so challenging, but, you know, inspiring as well. And I thought, what a great

636
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:59,490
testimony to that. But, and I think, you know, if you, if you meant those names you've just

637
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,750
mentioned, Dars, what's, what's also been good is the, the challenges that they're facing

638
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,410
to be able to bounce their ideas and thoughts off a collaborative group of their peers has

639
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,910
just been outstanding. And my job is to really, uh, sometimes a lot get out of the way.

640
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:17,769
But make sure the questions are really, um, to the point where you're really delving into

641
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,289
the things that are going to matter most to them.

642
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,210
And based on reflection and a bit of data and them surveying their players. So they

643
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,190
take on the feedback. This is what you're doing well. And this is what, you know, the

644
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,289
areas to improve. And you always talk about being in the, in the corner of coaches. Um,

645
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:38,230
I had this great, uh, lunch a few months back. Marcus Pontempelli, uh, gave me a call. He

646
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,230
was a superstar, Australian rules, captain of the Bulldogs, the club that I was lucky

647
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,950
enough to play for.

648
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:46,650
You couldn't meet a more impressive young person in your life. And, you know, I think

649
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:52,210
he's close to 25, but just the way he's thinking. And again, he'd heard about this collaboration.

650
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,809
He was talking to me about it and he wanted to form a group of his own. And so he's ended

651
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,789
up with, uh, Pat Cummings, who I understand, I know you've been working with that. He's

652
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,970
almost the identical person in cricket, revered as just an incredible young leader. I know

653
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,109
you've been working with him and they, uh, you know, I know the guys won't mind, but

654
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,809
Andy Lee is one of the great success stories in entertainment.

655
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:17,410
You could meet a better person than Andy Lee, Hamish and Andy, and their success is

656
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,609
just extraordinary. Rob Sitch from Working Dog, who, again, you couldn't, you know, describe

657
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:26,470
the group that are more creative. And to think that group of people are getting together,

658
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,549
two young sporting leaders with a couple of leaders from the arts. Um, tell us a bit about

659
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,549
that one.

660
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:36,089
Yeah. And I mean, you can take a lot of credit for this too, Darce, in terms of, you know,

661
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:40,910
us reflecting over, over COVID time and saying, you know, we really probably need to challenge

662
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,910
ourselves a lot more in terms of getting, you know, a lot of people involved in the

663
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:41,970
sport.

664
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:41,990
Yeah.

665
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,049
Yeah.

666
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:42,089
Yeah.

667
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:42,109
Yeah.

668
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:42,150
Yeah.

669
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,170
Yeah.

670
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,210
Yeah.

671
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,250
Yeah.

672
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,309
Yeah.

673
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:42,329
Yeah.

674
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:42,390
Yeah.

675
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,430
Yeah.

676
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:42,450
Yeah.

677
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,450
Yeah.

678
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,450
Yeah.

679
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:44,569
Yeah.

680
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:44,630
Yeah.

681
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,670
Yeah.

682
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:44,690
Yeah.

683
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:44,750
Yeah.

684
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,049
We've done this great work within schools and we've done, well, we think it's great.

685
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,890
I think it's great.

686
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,230
We've done this work in sport, you know, but is there these opportunities and we'd done

687
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,250
in a working corporate, is there an opportunity for us to challenge, um, you know, I guess

688
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,349
what we'd done previously and have cross collaborative groups.

689
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:07,009
And if the, if the focus is on our own leadership of self or, you know, improving our own environments,

690
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,490
why can't it be someone from the arts and why can't it be someone from sport?

691
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,390
And so, you know, that's been a really good opportunity.

692
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:19,369
good process, hasn't it? It sure has. And again, I love what, I certainly at 25 years of age didn't

693
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:25,250
have the thought process of Marcus Bond and Pellier, I'm sure Pat Cummings, but it's sports

694
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:31,109
a chapter for all of us and there are other things to learn and the opportunity to be out, as you

695
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:37,029
said, create these learning collaborative pods. And that's where you and I see it, don't we,

696
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:41,950
this opportunity to connect, we're calling it. And the idea that organically now we're just sort

697
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,309
of pulling groups together, these learning environments based on you and your environment

698
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,829
in real term, it's not, you know, the guest speaker, we've all been and seen great guest

699
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:55,109
speakers and it's, you know, it's fantastic and we love it. This is really, we see incredible

700
00:33:55,109 --> 00:34:01,089
opportunity to learn and grow. So we're interested in expanding that, aren't we, mate? Because you've

701
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:05,150
seen firsthand, the stories are just really powerful. Absolutely. It seems to be a really

702
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,610
great combination between having some rigor and depth and understanding of your own environment

703
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,909
and then being able to take some

704
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,329
really practical steps from the group, you know, as to how to address issues that we all face,

705
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,690
you know, issues about communication or issues about collaboration, issues about, you know,

706
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,590
having the vision of where to go. You know, there's a lot of great leaders out there that

707
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,050
have got brilliant hacks and a lot of people have listened to podcasts or read books and,

708
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,369
but if you've got the synthesis of people that are living it and breathing it at the time and

709
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,690
they can put it into practice and give you advice, but also on the flip side, if you can come armed

710
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,750
with some questions that are really going to be timely,

711
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,989
it's just such a powerful forum. Yeah. And that's, you know, why we're here.

712
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:52,349
The Empowering Leaders podcast is, you know, part of what we're hoping to bring together. And

713
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:59,429
we're seeing the 21st century guys firsthand who just get the idea that you need to give everyone

714
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:03,809
a voice. You can impact your invite, not just about you. It's not all about self all the time.

715
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:09,389
It's the shift from I, how about my self-improvement to how do I impact others? That's something that

716
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:11,750
we're really passionate about identifying, aren't we, mate?

717
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:16,809
Absolutely. It's such a key, isn't it? It's a crucial element. And if you think back to yourself

718
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:22,050
as when you had your first job, you know, any of the job you've had, if you had the type of leader

719
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,809
that really appreciated your thoughts and supported you along the way, communicated where they wanted

720
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:32,510
you to go with, provided you with feedback about what it was to get better, gave you opportunities

721
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:38,170
to impact and create the vision with them. I mean, it's an inspiring thing. And as you alluded to

722
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,349
with football coaches that coach the way that they were coached,

723
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:46,789
sometimes leaders lead the way they were led. And what we're finding is now the ones that are

724
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:53,489
really making a big difference in their environments and pushing forward, just they've got humility and

725
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:57,429
an understanding that they've got to bring people along for the journey. Sometimes it can be a bit

726
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:02,590
more time consuming because they like to be able to be decisive and there's always a time for that.

727
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,550
But great leaders recognize that collaboration is going to get you better results.

728
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,889
And we know firsthand that investing in this space, Matt, is an investment that does

729
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:16,269
pay off. I was looking at some stats, you know, in preparation for today, and there's a state of

730
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:22,690
the global workplace analysis done by Gallup back in 2018. And they came up with a number of 85%

731
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:28,690
of people generally not happy at work globally. And they had a number of $7 trillion annually

732
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:34,769
lost in productivity based on that. There was another survey of 400 large companies

733
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,510
called the cost of poor communication, talking about tens and tens of millions of dollars

734
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,510
just on the communication part alone. So,

735
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:47,050
to me, there's nothing sadder than being disengaged at work. It flows into your personal life. It

736
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,710
flows into your family. It flows into your general well-being and your happiness. People

737
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,630
take more sick days when they're disengaged at work. They cut corners because, you know,

738
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:02,190
they don't feel like they are connected to the place that they're in. It's a serious opportunity,

739
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,630
isn't it? Because we're, you know, seeing at the coalface. When you do reverse that,

740
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,829
you get buy-in, you get engagement. All these things come together in such an awesome way.

741
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:15,489
Yeah. Yeah, exactly right. And if I come back to my beginnings, you know,

742
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:23,030
the research into education leaves clues. And I know there's a lot of sporting analogies that

743
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,409
leaves clues too in terms of how to get the best out of people. But if the teacher has the greatest

744
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:33,909
impact in the environment of a classroom, it certainly makes sense to me that your leader

745
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:39,809
at your workplace has an incredibly impactful presence in your environment. So, if they change

746
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,869
their practice and their attitudes and their, you know, their, you know, their, you know, their, you

747
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:46,750
know, the way they work with the team, then it certainly can impact, you know, this idea that

748
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,130
you're talking about, which is people's willingness and love for their workplace. And as you know,

749
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,250
with this next era that we talk about, Darcy, there's going to be more and more push towards

750
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:02,010
working with a place that's, you know, relevant to you, they align to your values, and it's working

751
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,489
in the direction that you want to be going into. Now, the educator in you, mate, is always about

752
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:11,869
effectiveness and efficacy, and you won't do anything unless you measure it and can understand,

753
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:18,710
and part of what we're thinking in the Empowering Leaders podcast is to try and focus in, you've got

754
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,210
a lot of work now and a lot of history and a lot of data on the dimensions of what makes a great

755
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,489
leader. And you really put some work in the process of building an indicator tool. So, I encourage you

756
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:31,530
to have a look at doing that and start your own self-reflective journey on your impact on others

757
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,349
in the environment. But you've really put some thought and time and data into what makes a great

758
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:40,969
leader. So, I might try and delve into that with you. And hopefully, as the podcast progresses,

759
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:41,869
we can talk to you about that. So, thank you so much, Darcy.

760
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,150
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

761
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,590
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

762
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:48,650
Kylie Watson-Wheeler from Disney is an extraordinary leader about these dimensions and all the people

763
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,030
that we've mentioned before. I'm looking forward to finding if there is some synergy around these

764
00:38:54,030 --> 00:39:00,670
dimensions we've talked about. So, let me start because self-leadership is a big part of what you

765
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,389
talk about and one of the key dimensions. What does it mean to you? Yeah, it's fascinating,

766
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,010
isn't it? So, your ability to be able to impact any environment, really, you can only do that if

767
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,869
you're feeling good about yourself. You've got a lot of experience, you've got a lot of experience,

768
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,590
you've got to be able to know what you stand for, know where you're headed. You need to be

769
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:22,389
healthy. And so, if you think about some leaders out there that don't look after themselves and

770
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:27,510
get that right, it's really hard. And the other thing I should say too, you've got to live the

771
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,630
example. Leaders that you want to follow are ones that actually, they walk the talk. They've got

772
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,030
often very aspirational in terms of what could be done, but they've got their feet on the ground

773
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,809
and they're trying to get things done that live up to where they're headed. And so,

774
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,050
they're some of the most important things to get right. Your well-being,

775
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,110
your clarity of your direction, your values, they need to be going in the right direction.

776
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,929
A lot of leadership in the past, Matt, has been about the I and this is my personality profile

777
00:39:54,929 --> 00:40:00,489
and this is who I am. And there's a lot of those tools out there to identify you as a certain

778
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:05,550
character type. And in my mind, I've always felt that's a little bit restrictive in that that's

779
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,070
almost a definitive part about you're that type of character and you're going to have these

780
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,849
limitations. Whereas, we're talking about a lot of people that are going to have these

781
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,750
limitations. We're talking now about, yes, self-reflection, as you said, is where you need

782
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:21,389
to start. But then, the dimension you really want to focus in, how are you impacting others?

783
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:26,349
Why is that important? Yeah, that's right. I mean, I reflected on a lot of, I've done a lot

784
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:30,710
of those tests and they do give you an insight into yourself and I'm not dismissing those. But

785
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:35,590
that to me is always a small part of the puzzle. I'm with you, Darce. I just believe it's more

786
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:41,230
about, it can't be just about me. It can't be just about my knowledge of self. It's actually

787
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,429
going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about

788
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:41,449
me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about

789
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:41,949
me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to

790
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:41,989
be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me. It's going to be about me.

791
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:46,730
How can I genuinely, and you've said it previously, how can I genuinely positively impact

792
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:52,070
those around me? That is the outcome of improving. You lead self, you change the environment,

793
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:56,349
you can change the practices around your environment. And the outcome of that is the

794
00:40:56,349 --> 00:41:01,690
impact. And to your question about what have I seen and what's fascinating for me here,

795
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,389
and actually comes back to your comment about junior football coaches or junior any coaches,

796
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:11,010
is we just do, we get mesmerized by the scoreboard. And what's

797
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,030
astounding to me is that a lot of those junior coaches may not recognize that

798
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:22,070
virtually no elite coach does that. They definitely are process oriented. And they're

799
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,489
really about the impact they're having on the individuals in their environment and the processes

800
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:31,449
they're trying to improve to create great outcomes. The scoreboard is a byproduct of that.

801
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:38,190
And the same applies to KPIs in workplaces. So if you're just measuring the KPIs and you're

802
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,329
not considering how you're leading yourself,

803
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,650
the outcomes you're trying to achieve in terms of betterment of people and developing your people,

804
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,750
you're measuring the wrong thing. If you measure those things about developing your people and

805
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,230
developing your environment, the scoreboard is a great indicator as to it's working.

806
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:01,269
But that's where the impact conversation comes out. And you take it back to your comments and

807
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:07,170
about John Hattie at the start, it's being so curious as an educator about what am I doing

808
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,769
in the classroom today and this week that's going to make a difference to these kids in my care?

809
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,989
It's being quite relentless in that.

810
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,030
Yeah, it's brilliant. So that's talking about the dimension of how you impact others and

811
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,469
you're passionate about how you go about creating and sharing it. What can you tell us about that?

812
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:27,170
As we talked about before, there's a general push now in society for people to

813
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,210
understand and be cognizant that they're going to spend a lot of time at work.

814
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:36,130
And you want to be working or working towards something that you believe in.

815
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:40,070
And that's not always going to be the case for everyone, but there's always going to be

816
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,989
opportunities for you to be able to do that. And that's going to be the case for everyone.

817
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:47,150
to align some of your values to the vision of the company. And if companies can recognize or

818
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,849
businesses can recognize where they're trying to make a difference, and then you can enable

819
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:56,969
your team to be part of contributing or co-contributing to that vision, I think it's a

820
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:01,769
really great opportunity. And the great organizations I've worked with are really quite

821
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:07,510
inclusive in terms of shaping that together. There's always someone that's got that inspiration

822
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,989
and you look for that and you need that. And everyone's got their role to play.

823
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,630
But the contribution or the co-contribution is really important.

824
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:17,630
So how do you approach learning and improvement? That's the other dimension

825
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,309
that you want to talk about as well, learning and improvement.

826
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:28,570
So learning is generally about being quite open. Carol Dweck speaks about growth mindset.

827
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,289
And it's definitely about having that aptitude to say, as a leader, I just definitely don't

828
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:38,030
have to have all the answers. I do really need to be clear on where we're going and whether

829
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,969
whatever you're bringing to me in terms of new learning is

830
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,989
going to support me going along that journey. But it's genuinely about, is this going to

831
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:52,349
be a possibility here and being open to that? And acknowledging that you as a leader do not

832
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:56,630
have to have all the answers. You need to embrace your allies. You need to use people around you

833
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,730
for support. You need to seek counsel. You need to understand that you can't do it alone.

834
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,929
And we want to set leaders up for success. And we're not going to do that unless we

835
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:10,090
understand those things. Communicating with clarity is a dimension that you're

836
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:10,989
really passionate about. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a

837
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:16,929
absolutely. I mean, when we go in, I've learned this. This actually came from our research that

838
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:22,050
we've done. One of the areas that there's often a great discrepancy in any environment we've

839
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:28,309
worked in, whether it be schools, corporate, or in sport, is the clarity around this particular

840
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:33,949
statement. What's the criteria by which you're being judged? And the clarity around that is,

841
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,090
how well is that communicated? How well is it today? For example, how well am I

842
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:46,130
the criteria by which I'm being judged? It's an interesting question. And sometimes there's a

843
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,250
lot of guesswork that goes into it. And I think that the way that leaders can communicate the

844
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:57,070
expectations, but even if they're going to elevate their performance, what you want to do in the end

845
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,989
is you want to create the conditions where the people that you're leading are co-constructing

846
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:06,769
the criteria by which they're being judged. Because if I'm doing that, I've got an intent

847
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:10,949
knowledge of, or an in-depth knowledge of your expectations of me, but also,

848
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,050
how I'm going to contribute to the betterment of where I am, whether it be the classroom,

849
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:21,050
or whether it be the organization, or the team. How am I going to contribute to that? And what

850
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,010
am I being judged on? What should I be judged on? And often we're thinking immediately,

851
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,650
in any startup business, and that's what we've created ourselves. It's the bottom line and,

852
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:37,989
God, how do I get to a successful, sustained part of your business and have enough income?

853
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:40,389
The financial metrics are huge, but

854
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,230
as we know, if you don't work on, there's a stat that I read recently, if people don't feel like

855
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,269
they're being developed in their environment, they're 12 times more likely to leave. And we

856
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:55,849
know the cost of that, finding new people to work with is just enormous strain and burden. So

857
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,829
having an understanding about this, isn't it? Whether you're, as I said before, in a small

858
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:05,190
business of two people, or three people, or in a huge organization, there's an opportunity to learn

859
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,750
and have an impact on this straight away, isn't there? Absolutely. I'm thinking about

860
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,389
communication at the moment and thinking about, there are different communication styles too, but

861
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:22,530
one thing that's been a surprise to me is the absolute elite leaders, they are exceptional

862
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,389
listeners. And if you think about when you're at school and the different lessons you learn,

863
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:31,610
and there's so many things, we don't want to throw stones at school, but certainly when I was at

864
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:38,269
school, no one ever picked up on my listening skills. And the great leaders in terms of

865
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:40,730
communication, they're intent listeners. And I think that's one of the things that I've been

866
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:45,650
and they're really reflective listeners, and they just don't jump to conclusions too quickly.

867
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,889
And once again, it can be time consuming, but it's about having that disciplined approach.

868
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,730
I'm actually, now I've got to be really present. I've really got to listen. I've got to put

869
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,150
everything aside and just be with you, Luke, right now, be understanding what you're saying,

870
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:03,769
not just to respond, but actually think about how that can impact me and improve my life.

871
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,550
Underestimated skill, isn't that? The ability to listen as part of communication. And

872
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,670
we're talking about this world of collaboration,

873
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:14,610
the leader of the world of collaboration is the language where you, how important is it to you?

874
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:21,090
It is right up there as one of the most important things you can do. And there is a time cost,

875
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:27,090
but it pays itself back in spades. If you prioritize collaboration and you're strategic

876
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:33,030
about how you do it and you embrace great strategies to do it, the payoffs are extreme,

877
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,269
whether it be the scoreboard taking care of itself, whether it be the outcomes in the classroom,

878
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:40,690
or whether it be the outcomes on the field, it pays.

879
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,989
It pays dividends if you can collaborate well and not dismiss the ideas of others too readily.

880
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,969
There'll be people that will say, yeah, okay, but you've got to have a decision maker,

881
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,989
can't have too many chiefs. And that's a thinking that a lot of people perhaps listened to this was

882
00:47:55,989 --> 00:48:01,630
a sounds great and it sounds fluffy. But your experience is saying that, and clearly at some

883
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,449
point you do need decision making and you collaborate to an extent. What's the fine

884
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:10,230
line in achieving that? Yeah, I think it actually does come back to

885
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:16,429
energy. If you're setting up the conditions for collaboration, you've got to only pose the

886
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:20,989
question if you're genuine about it. I think sometimes people collaborate on the little

887
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:24,269
things that actually don't make a difference and they think, oh, yep, I've ticked that box.

888
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:29,610
We're going to collaborate today on how to paint the studio. Brilliant. That's a great thing.

889
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:36,389
Try and think about things that are genuinely a chance for you to improve, processes you can

890
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:40,329
improve and genuinely ask the question, and then do it in a strategic way,

891
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,769
not that you're going to guide the answer, but that there is going to be a conclusion.

892
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,289
So you're already thinking about that opportunity to collaborate and you're going to think about

893
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:54,030
when is the decision going to be made and how am I going to get the thoughts in? But at the end of

894
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,929
the day, Darcy, you're right, there's still going to be a decision to be made. And mate, it's

895
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:03,230
interesting, those six dimensions are something I know you're really passionate about. It's your

896
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:09,650
hack, it's your data. You put a lot of time into what you think over this journey makes a great

897
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,730
leader and you've been doing it for a long time. And I think that's a great thing to do. And I think

898
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,070
witnessing great leadership up close and personal now for many, many years. And is there

899
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:21,369
something that you think, God, I'm seeing traits already. There's a pattern here around what great

900
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:27,190
leadership looks like. There is a pattern. There is a pattern. And a lot of the qualities we've

901
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:33,530
talked about today is certainly part of that. I mean, the other part that I guess we haven't

902
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:39,829
talked too much about is the curiosity and the creativity together. Just being really curious

903
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:40,730
about what you're doing. And I think that's a great thing to do. And I think that's a great

904
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:47,010
I can do as a leader to impact positively those people around me. And what can I learn from other

905
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:52,690
people? Rob Sitch sent us a great article the other day and we read through it as a group. And

906
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:58,030
it was basically written by an astronaut and it was about the lessons learned from being an

907
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:02,269
astronaut and how it applies to life on earth. Sometimes when we go into a new environment,

908
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:08,010
we want to stand out, but it's about sometimes we actually just really need to be a great teammate

909
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,590
first. And I think what I'm noticing,

910
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:16,590
about great leaders is that they were once great teammates and they used to pride themselves on

911
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,789
being a great teammate. And that actually becomes a really good hallmark of a really good leader.

912
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,409
Because if you're a great teammate, you like to embrace the thoughts of others. You like to be

913
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:31,989
clear about where you're going. You like to communicate well with people. And so this

914
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:36,690
chapter that he sent through was talking about when you're a zero, that's about being a great

915
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,730
teammate. When you're a plus one, you really want to stand out from the crowd. And the chapter,

916
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,210
goes on to explain that when they're filtering out the NASA astronauts from when they've got

917
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,929
through top of their class, what they do is they take them to a cocktail party and the prior

918
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:55,969
NASA astronauts are at the cocktail party and they separate them out. And then they have a

919
00:50:55,969 --> 00:51:01,090
drink with them all to work out whether this person is a zero or a plus one. Is this someone

920
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:06,429
who's just going to be a great teammate? Or is this someone who is going to try and stand out

921
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:10,590
from the crowd and be a hero? What they want is a zero. They don't always want the plus one.

922
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,670
And so a lot of the great leaders I'm working with is a zero. They really want a compliment.

923
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,449
They really want to make the most of their environment for the people that they're

924
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:23,309
working with. They don't necessarily want to be the hero, the sage on the stage.

925
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:28,929
It's a brilliant story, Matt. And Matt, I feel as connected to this space as anything I've done

926
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:33,929
in my life. And I feel lucky that to play sport for a living was a great thing I wanted to do

927
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:38,389
from a young age, a bit like you. Playing sport, I wanted to work in the media. I had a pretty

928
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,730
clear vision around that. But I already had a lot of experience with the media. I had a lot of

929
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,750
feel like this chapter, when we sit together, talk about these stories, see the impact it has

930
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,269
on people, genuinely positive impact it has on people. And I've been in work environments and

931
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:54,389
seen work environments with disengaged people. And it makes me sad because I've never felt that

932
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:00,110
way. I've always been fortunate to, and I suppose maybe determined that I wouldn't tolerate not

933
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,530
being in a space that you weren't focused and passionate about. So Matt, the work you're doing,

934
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,670
it's inspiring, Matt. To reconnect our old friendship has been one of the great things

935
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,710
that's happened in recent times.

936
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,849
Not that we ever lost touch, but now, Matt, I think I spend more time on the phone than you,

937
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:20,510
than I do with Beck. And I think Sarah, your wife's going, it's a bromance. We love it. We

938
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:25,869
see that there's so much potential in it. And it is an opportunity, Matt, to talk about, I hope

939
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:30,469
people do have a look at Alita, have a look at, we want to expand those Alita Connect little learning

940
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:35,650
pods. We want to get into education. We're really passionate about. I know we're going to do some

941
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,570
work in the mental health space in schools because the cold face you're telling me,

942
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,150
really clearly that we need to get back into schools. And we've got some great plans in the

943
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,030
world of collaboration that we're undertaking, mate. So it's a great way to start. I couldn't

944
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,710
be more passionate about what we're doing. And it's based on your ideas, mate, and your execution

945
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:02,030
and the way you, to me, it doesn't matter if you're in a room with a prep teacher or Justin

946
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,269
Langer, you're yourself in every environment. People pick up on your authenticity, mate,

947
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:10,409
and everything you do. And it's been an awesome thing to be involved with you in.

948
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:15,010
Thanks, mate. It's my privilege. And you're definitely underselling yourself there in terms

949
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:20,949
of the impact you have on our work. And we've described you as our centred visionary of the

950
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:26,670
team. And you get us to think big picture. And I think, and it comes back to some of the self

951
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,309
leadership that you do yourself, mate, with the meditation and your link to purpose and doing

952
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:36,070
things that are purposeful for you. It just resonates with us. And it's why we connect so

953
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,150
well. And it's why it's a great partnership, mate. So thanks for having me along. And yeah,

954
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,710
thanks for all that.

955
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,469
Thanks for all of your work that you've done to get the podcast going as well.

956
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:49,369
Head to Aleda, A-L-E-D-A, and have a look at the Empowering Leaders Indicator. So final question,

957
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:53,210
question without notice, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

958
00:53:54,090 --> 00:54:02,219
Well, that's a brilliant question. The greatest leader. There's a big pause there. I mean,

959
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:09,679
I just, I'm genuinely, I just feel like, I just feel like no one's perfect. And I just feel like

960
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,400
I'm in the most privileged position ever, that I get to see these incredible,

961
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:18,320
incredible leaders. And if I could take parts of all of them, you could almost make up this

962
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,500
unbelievable leader. You know, there's some of the elements of some of these footy coaches that

963
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,380
are just incredible storytellers. There's elements of the school teachers that just got

964
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,260
incredible empathy and connection with their, with the kids that they're teaching. And then

965
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,460
some of these corporate leaders that have just got this vision of what's possible in terms of

966
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:42,099
having global impact that, I mean, if you could just combine those things together.

967
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,400
Um, but, but there's,

968
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,960
there's not one leader that just stands out as, as the, the standout that I've worked with

969
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,760
personally. Um, you know, from a historical perspective, I've just always loved, you know,

970
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,500
the idea of Gandhi and, and that, that the, the, the story of his life and the millions that he's

971
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,840
impacted and the way he went about it and the way he, you know, walk the talk. And so, you know,

972
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,019
he's one that just springs to mind to us, but there's, there's so many great ones. It's really

973
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:09,940
hard to, to choose. We didn't get you off the fence, mate. I think that's going to be a hard

974
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,099
question to answer for, uh, for our guests. We're, you know,

975
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,219
lucky to be connected, uh, as we said, from incredible educators to these amazing sporting

976
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:22,719
leaders and leaders from industry and the arts. That's what we're planning with the Empowering

977
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,539
Leaders podcast. We couldn't start anywhere apart from, uh, with you and your story,

978
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,699
Matty. As I said, it's a friendship that I value greatly, and we'll look forward to many more years

979
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:36,559
of, uh, hopefully inspiring people to, uh, to begin their learning and reflection and collaboration.

980
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,579
Thank you, mate.
