00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,870
Matthew Nix is the current coach of the Adelaide Crows in the Australian Football League.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,509
Before he became a coach, Nixie was an outstanding player for the Sydney Swans

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,689
and part of their famous Bloods culture.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,750
Nixie was built from the ground up in the AFL,

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,570
with legends of the Sydney Swans making him earn his stripes as a young, brash 18-year-old.

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,170
I had a bit of swagger about me.

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:27,629
I was young, I was so nervous walking into that footy club

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,809
and my way of dealing with that was to sort of push the chest out a bit

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,670
and swagger my way in like I'm a big deal.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,770
They tell me the story to this day that when I went down that day training,

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,710
there was a couple of guys that had a bit of a smirk and a bit of a laugh

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,630
and said, well, this was probably needed.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,450
That Bloods culture has stuck with Nixie right the way through

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,390
and using that to mould his own style in his current role as coach of the Crows.

15
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,509
It was a very simple thing that we prided ourselves on and that was putting the team first.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,310
We had a culture that was basically just prioritise others and put your teammates first.

17
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,350
The team's always number one and then from that individuals will shine.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,209
We see many leaders like Matthew Nix, constant, never-ending self-improvers,

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,049
always looking for ways to get better.

20
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,090
And for Nixie, the pillar of leadership he is working on the most is his communication.

21
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,430
It was probably one of the things I thought was my weapon.

22
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,370
Since being in the hot chair, I've found it's one of my work-ons.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,530
It's one that I've got to improve on.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,409
People like Matthew Nix, who we are incredibly privileged to have as part of our Alita community.

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,290

You don't have to be the coach of the Adelaide Crows like Matthew Nix to be involved.

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,950
We'd love you to book a discovery call today.

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,969
A big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,450
A mattress like no other.

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,329
NASA approved.

34
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,469
A third of your life is spent in bed.

35
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,950
You may as well make it at Temper.

36
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,390
Matthew Nix was an elite junior soccer player as a kid.

37
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,709
However, after watching the Adelaide Crows play in his home state of South Australia in the early 1990s,

38
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,730
he decided to switch codes to the Australian Rules football game.

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,129
It was a decision that would see him.

40
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:08,349
He went on to have a decade-long, 175-game professional career with the Sydney Swans

41
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:13,629
and ultimately leading back to where it all started as the now senior coach of the Adelaide Football Club

42
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,289
for the past five seasons.

43
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,310
Nixie, great to catch up with you.

44
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,229
Thanks, Darce.

45
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,490
Am I on the money with that?

46
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,090
Can you tell us about that night where you're sitting at the footy, soccer was your game,

47
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,889
and you thought, you know what, I'm going to change codes.

48
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,310
Is that true?

49
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,530
It's 100% true other than one word, which was elite soccer player.

50
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,449
I was solid.

51
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,090
I was solid as a soccer player.

52
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,189
I played it right through to 60.

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,229
16, 17 years of age, but definitely not elite.

54
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,729
Definitely not elite.

55
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,169
What drew you to the round ball game?

56
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:41,610
Probably friends.

57
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,389
You know, as you do, you start out at school and you build, I guess,

58
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,810
connections with other friends and so on, and then you follow.

59
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,530
And I followed a lot of my friends into soccer.

60
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,229
My older brother played soccer.

61
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,650
It wasn't necessarily as invested in sport as what I was, but yeah,

62
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,069
I just ended up with the round ball rather than the over one.

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,969
And can you literally remember sitting there?

64
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,669
It would have been footy park in those days.

65
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,110
Yeah.

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,349
You know, the Crows are the biggest game in town and huge amount of passion,

67
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,610
as you know, better than anyone else.

68
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,310
And do you remember thinking, Hey, I'm going to have a crack at this?

69
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:12,550
Yeah.

70
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,370
I got to do this.

71
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,490
It was almost one of those.

72
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,669
I remember standing with dad.

73
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,289
You can't stand there anymore.

74
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,710
The grandstand's gone of where I was exactly standing.

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,289
But if you were to drop down 20 meters, we now run out through

76
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,810
that area for training every day.

77
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,090
So every now and then I'll reminisce on the moment that where I was standing

78
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,490
there, the grass is still the same oval.

79
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,030
And so I'm able to look back and say, well, this was the spot almost.

80
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,229
Where I made a decision to change sports and had no idea that I'd end

81
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,069
up getting an opportunity.

82
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,669
I did classic sliding doors moment in life.

83
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,590
Isn't it to go from there at what age?

84
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,330
Well, I would have been, that would have been 16 when I was at the footy at that

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,930
stage, and then went with a few mates to West Adelaide, which is one of the

86
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,370
SNFL local clubs, um, played under 17s at West Adelaide and then 19s reserves.

87
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,030
And talk about being in the right spot at the right time.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,169
We won the reserves premiership into 1994.

89
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,370
I was in the right spot at the right time.

90
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,389
Recruiters were there watching.

91
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:11,289
Amazing to then go on and have, you know, as I said, a 10 year career at the Sydney

92
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,750
Swans from that later start in life.

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,569
I mean, you clearly took to the game pretty quickly.

94
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,370
I had some very good coaches.

95
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,029
It wasn't super fast.

96
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,209
I arrived in Sydney after being drafted in that first week, I took on Dean McRae,

97
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,689
who was one of the strongest guys in the side and I came off second best.

98
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:29,769
I broke my tib fib.

99
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,829
So I spent the first 12 months watching, which in, when you look back on it, talk

100
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:34,189
about sliding doors.

101
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,410
It was a blessing in disguise because I wasn't ready for footy.

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,509
You know, there was a lot still to learn about the game.

103
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,250
And so that 12 months of being able to watch build up my body in the gym was, was a blessing

104
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,550
for me.

105
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:46,569
Pretty serious injury.

106
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,529
And you break both those bones in your, in your leg, but you look at that as a blessing.

107
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,490
You gave you a chance to really understand and learn rather than trying to slug it out

108
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,629
without being prepared.

109
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,209
Yeah, it taught me a couple of things.

110
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:01,449
One, I had to drink more milk, uh, cause it was the second broken leg I'd had.

111
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,149
I broke my leg playing soccer a couple of years earlier.

112
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:04,810
The other one.

113
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:08,930
So it taught me that, but it also gave me that, that chance to sit back and watch.

114
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,449
I was, it was interesting because when you go back, Paul Kelly, Tony Lockhart, you know,

115
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,709
these are the sort of names that, that I, I came to the Swans and joined as a teammate.

116
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,750
Now I had a bit of swagger about me.

117
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:24,930
Um, you know, I was young, I was so nervous walking into that footy club and my way of

118
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,410
dealing with that was to sort of push the chest out a bit and swagger my way in.

119
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,230
Like I'm a big deal.

120
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:33,610
They, they tell me the story to this day that when, when I went down that day at training,

121
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,889
there was a couple of guys that had a bit of a smirk and a bit of a laugh and said, well,

122
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,430
that if this was probably needed.

123
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,870
So talk about blessings, you know, that gave me a chance to watch, become a little more

124
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,810
humble and understand how good you've got to be to play at the level.

125
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,069
And then they shared that with me a number of years later, Paul Kelly, of all people

126
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,649
were the nicest man in the whole world, you know, taught me a really big lesson.

127
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,089
That's a bit of feedback, isn't it?

128
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,069
At a young age, isn't it?

129
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,910
Coming into an environment, you said at all time, legends of the game, the greatest ever

130
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,649
goal kicker and Brownlow medal winner and Paul Kelly, but you just felt like you were,

131
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,329
your nervousness was portrayed the wrong way.

132
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,949
You felt like you probably needed a little bit of that lesson.

133
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:09,589
Yeah.

134
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:14,050
And it's, well, and it's taught me a lot too, because I now see it every 12 months.

135
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,589
We get a new batch of young guys coming into the club through the draft, you know, 17,

136
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,889
18, 19 years old.

137
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:25,189
And occasionally one will come in with a similar persona, a similar sort of walk and strut

138
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,970
and the chest out.

139
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,930
And my experience enables me to sit down with them and have a great conversation and share

140
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,970
with, you know, some of the stuff I went through.

141
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,350
And I think it's been out of help.

142
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,569
I think it's been out of help in a big way.

143
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,470
I'm told that is one of your great strengths.

144
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,069
You're a great connector of people and you light up a room no matter who it is.

145
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,089
I mean, it's a different generation.

146
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,870
As an 18 year old, you were probably going to get a bit of a clip and someone was going

147
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,389
to come after you.

148
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,829
That generation now at 18 are a very different mindset.

149
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,829
Do you have to change the way you approach that given the evolving nature of this young

150
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:57,310
generation?

151
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,269
No, I know we talk about the generation being different and some will say they're a lot

152
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:02,930
more entitled.

153
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,069
I don't find that.

154
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,050
I think we're all the same.

155
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,730
I think people are just able to express themselves a little more.

156
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,529
Eventually, our guys realise if they do come in and the strut's there and there's that

157
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:18,129
almost that front or a mask, you've got to take it off if you're going to build the

158
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,810
connections you need to build and you're going to become a successful team.

159
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:21,990
So you're able to work through it.

160
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,230
But I think we allow that though now.

161
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,790
I think we open up and we want to hear, we want to see that expression from our players.

162
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,149
We don't want them to come in and hide and say, hey, you respect the sixth year player

163
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:32,949
for this reason.

164
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,769
It's like, no, respect them because they're a human being.

165
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,410
And then that sixth year player needs to respect the young kid coming in as well.

166
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,930
It's going to fast track our development.

167
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,029
But yeah, we do get some good characters coming in nowadays though.

168
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,430
In the early 90s, Nixie, when you walk into an AFL environment, the coaching landscape's

169
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,050
pretty brutal.

170
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:56,310
I remember one of your old teammates, Paul Roos, a legend of the game who went on to

171
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,290
coach and win premierships successfully saying that he wrote down a list as a player of the

172
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,670
things he thought were crazy.

173
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,310
About the way the game was coached.

174
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,350
And he put it in the top drawer.

175
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,769
And as a coach, you take that out and read it and go, I'm never going to be like that.

176
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,569
Have you had a similar thought from your experience?

177
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:16,689
Not exactly the same as Roosie, but I had heard that story and I was lucky enough to

178
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,370
be coached by Roosie and he's a huge influence on who I am as a coach.

179
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,970
Along with others, you know, Roosie had a style, amazing communicator and his ability

180
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,470
to connect our group or bring out the belief in players.

181
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,289
You know, I saw him transform.

182
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,950
Adam Goodes, you know, from a good footballer into one of the greatest I've seen play.

183
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,870
And I was lucky enough to play alongside him.

184
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,970
At his best, Adam Goodes was outstanding.

185
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,070
I have a similar or something similar to that.

186
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,950
I have a contract with really close friends and or mentors that we drew up.

187
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,129
And it's just a pretend rollout fake contract that we've got.

188
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,389
If I ever change my values or I change my behaviour, then I've got a certain amount of people in

189
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,090
special areas that are able to just.

190
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,070
Maybe call me up or sit me down face to face and just let me know and roll the contract

191
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,529
out and say, hang on, we agreed on, you wouldn't change who you were and what you valued.

192
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,529
And I've had to do that once or twice over the five years since taking the head coaching

193
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:15,809
role.

194
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,990
The head coaching role comes with some challenges, but I've been able to stick to what I value,

195
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,490
but I have had some help with that.

196
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,190
So you've had a couple of moments where, you know, these great mentors and friends in your

197
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,389
inner circle have tapped you on the shoulder and said, I reckon you're just slightly getting

198
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:32,210
away from, from.

199
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,909
Can you give us a bit of detail on that or maybe not the tap on the shoulder?

200
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,769
It's probably me sourcing out, um, you know, trying to find some information and it there's,

201
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,769
you know, there's been recent ones where I've called them up and I've said, listen, I've

202
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,649
got a, I've got a decision to make, and I just want to get your thoughts around this.

203
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,710
And, and after, you know, five minutes of me speaking and not a lot coming from the

204
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,809
other way, we then sat in silence for the next minute and then back down the phone.

205
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,309
I said, are you there?

206
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,429
Did you, sorry, still there?

207
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,090
And the line, the message back down the phone was, you don't have a decision to make my

208
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,269
friend.

209
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,190
Unless of course you've changed what it is you value.

210
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,850
And that was enough for me.

211
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:07,629
That was, thank you.

212
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,590
I'll, I'll chat to you soon.

213
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,070
Good on you for seeking that out.

214
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:15,629
I think there's a lot of things you can't control as a senior coach in sport or a senior

215
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:19,450
leader in lots of ways, but having an impact on the culture and those values, it sounds

216
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,710
like you've got a really clear idea of what that is.

217
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,330
Can you describe the culture you're trying to build at the Adelaide Crows?

218
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,009
What does that look like?

219
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,389
Yeah, well, it's, I mean, it's a blend of a lot of cultures I've seen, but there's one

220
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,210
standout culture that I spent my whole football career.

221
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:33,350
Which was the Sydney Swans.

222
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,309
And we, it was a very simple thing that we prided ourselves on, and that was putting

223
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,029
the team first.

224
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,889
And there's a lot of different terminologies around it.

225
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,690
You know, a lot of people spoke about the Bloods culture and so on and so forth.

226
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,889
I'm not sure we ever used that terminology.

227
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:51,210
I think that was someone made that up in the media, but we had a culture that was basically

228
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,009
just prioritise others and put your teammates first.

229
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,889
The team's always number one.

230
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,990
And then from that individuals will shine when it's their moment.

231
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,129
And so I've really driven that.

232
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,169
That's what we're going after at the Adelaide Footy Club.

233
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,490
I spent time with Port Adelaide as well.

234
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,370
You know, eight years working there as an assistant.

235
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,129
And, you know, even as an assistant these days, it's really important that you're able

236
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,289
to bring your own values.

237
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,250
And I guess if you're true to those, then others will follow.

238
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,450
So I spent time there and a year with the Giants as well, where I was lucky enough to

239
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,409
be alongside some, you know, some super players, as well as some super people off field.

240
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,830
You know, Leon Cameron was a massive influence on what I'm doing now.

241
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,750
And, you know, there's not many better than him.

242
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,370
It comes to understanding others and prioritising others.

243
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,669
So that's what we're trying to do at the Adelaide Footy Club at this point.

244
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,730
It's tough because we don't have any winning wallpaper at the moment or not a lot of winning

245
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,450
wallpaper, but we'll get there.

246
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:49,090
To go micro for a minute and the story that comes to mind, I think one of the most exciting

247
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,350
players in the competition, Josh Rochelli, in your team, you have a difficult decision.

248
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,429
He's made some choices.

249
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,049
And how do you get to those choices where you decide to leave him out for the last game?

250
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,750
But is it just being, that's another part that's been really clear.

251
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:02,110
This is what we should do.

252
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,549
This is what we stand for.

253
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,330
It's team first.

254
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,629
Can you give us some detail on how you arrive at decisions like that?

255
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,309
Yeah.

256
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,590
Well, you really nailed it.

257
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,070
You know, this is what we're about.

258
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,309
Unfortunately, it hasn't, you know, the behaviours haven't quite fit that at this point.

259
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:20,730
If you talk about why we did it, we did it or in the end, I say we, because we make decisions

260
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,250
as a group.

261
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,570
Ultimately, I'm the one who has to stamp that.

262
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,870
We did it because of the relationship that Josh and I now have, which is 10 times stronger

263
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,509
than it was pre the decision.

264
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,789
And that's where we've come to.

265
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,289
That's where I just knew there wasn't really a decision to make.

266
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:37,429
I knew long-term Josh and I were going to be better for it.

267
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,929
I know he's going to be a fantastic footballer and a leader of our footy club into the future.

268
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,230
It was important though, in this moment, that we made the decision we did.

269
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,389
What I don't want to do is have a leader, which Josh is going to be, going the wrong

270
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,750
direction.

271
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,669
And so it was a small adjustment we made.

272
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,990
And I look forward to him coming back next year and some people saying, oh, well, they

273
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,950
did make the right call there.

274
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,710
And that's what great leadership's about, isn't it?

275
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,549
Making those calls.

276
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:08,090
Even when they are uncomfortable, I look at your role and we just chatted briefly before

277
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,029
we went to air and the amount of pressure that professional coaches face here in Australia.

278
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:16,629
And I think here in Australia, maybe at the absolute extreme, but around the globe, you

279
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,389
lose two games, sack Matthew Nix.

280
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,250
You might've won four premierships in Alistair Clarkson, you lose three games and it's, hey,

281
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,669
we want you out of the space.

282
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:30,070
It's an incredible amount of stress to absorb continually.

283
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,850
How do you go about it?

284
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:32,350
How do you cope?

285
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,429
I don't read it for one or listen to it.

286
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,250
So how do you do that?

287
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:37,330
That's interesting to me.

288
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:41,769
You really just decide that's not helpful, but it always gets back, doesn't it?

289
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:42,830
Someone's going to share it with you.

290
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:42,950
Yeah.

291
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,529
Well, you just shared some with me then.

292
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,210
I'm sitting back now going, really?

293
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:46,929
Did they say that?

294
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:53,190
No, you can't hide from it, especially where we're based in South Australia, which is a

295
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,549
two-team town, as is Victoria, super passionate about Australian rules football.

296
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,049
But with the two teams, it does make sense.

297
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:00,509
It does make it tough.

298
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,350
I've just watched one of my mentors, a former coach I worked under in Ken Hinckley, lose

299
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,110
a prelim final.

300
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,889
What a fantastic effort to get there, to battle to where they did through injury.

301
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:17,190
And yet I'm looking at Ken under pressure at the moment, externally, which is just madness.

302
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,669
There's one team that's going to succeed this year, if you think success is winning a

303
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:27,269
premiership only, to then judge a coach around that and make decisions off the back of a

304
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,570
game that goes one kick on the siren.

305
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,529
Either way, it's madness, but it's what passion brings.

306
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,570
It's why we love the sport.

307
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,950
It's why it's the most watched sport in our country.

308
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:42,970
It's why there's so much commercial dollars coming in behind it, because people are entertained

309
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,110
by it and we're all driven by it.

310
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,309
So my job, though, is to try not to listen to too much of the noise and just continue

311
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:54,149
to back in what it is we're doing, as we were talking about before, the values of what we're

312
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:54,409
building.

313
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,370
Because if we go into the detail of where we're at as a football club at the moment,

314
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:58,450
we're not going to be able to do that.

315
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:58,529
We're not going to be able to do that.

316
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:58,629
We're not going to be able to do that.

317
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,669
We're not going to be able to do that.

318
00:14:58,669 --> 00:14:58,730
We're not going to be able to do that.

319
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,929
To think we're going to win the premiership and to be a bit blase about it, like, if we

320
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,590
don't do it, we fail, then we're kidding ourselves.

321
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,509
We have a very young group of players that are still learning and developing.

322
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,889
We're having some huge success in a lot of areas, and it's not necessarily being seen

323
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,009
at the moment on the scoreboard.

324
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,429
But we know it's going to put us in a good space for that sustained success.

325
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,610
And I think this is a really important conversation.

326
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,730
What does success actually mean in life and in sport?

327
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,649
And I've said this a few times.

328
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:30,950
It was one of the saddest quotes, and Nathan Buckley, I've discussed this with him, where

329
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,649
he said he didn't enjoy one moment of his whole career because he was told, until you

330
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,809
win a premiership, you can't celebrate it.

331
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,710
And that's one of the all-time greats.

332
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,610
Tony Lockett, who you mentioned earlier, didn't win a premiership.

333
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,289
Does that mean his career wasn't successful?

334
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,389
I think that language is something that is interesting to me.

335
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,029
It doesn't clearly make sense.

336
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,710
Clearly, if you won premierships, that's the ultimate.

337
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,129
Everyone's trying to achieve it.

338
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,889
But there are degrees of success, aren't there?

339
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,610
Yeah.

340
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:57,990
There are.

341
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:01,690
But you're building for that ultimate success.

342
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,070
But I think what you'll find when you do get it.

343
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:07,610
Now, we won a premiership in 2005.

344
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,470
I didn't play on the day.

345
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,370
I played all year and missed out on the day through injury and probably wasn't quite up

346
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,470
to the form at that point.

347
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,470
I would have been selected anyway.

348
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:23,590
But after winning that premiership, the moment was there for a fleeting moment.

349
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,070
And then it was, what now?

350
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,250
The journey to get there was what?

351
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,090
It was the most rewarding.

352
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,190
That's what I look back on and I say.

353
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,110
The relationships we built over 11 years, that was the rewarding part.

354
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,710
And that's, I think, when you come back and you have a reunion as a premiership side,

355
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,309
you don't come back necessarily for that one day.

356
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,690
You come back for the 10 years prior to that that you built together and that camaraderie

357
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,230
that you've got.

358
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,450
It's hard because I understand, you know, for Bucks, a lot of that was the noise from

359
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:51,870
outside.

360
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,350
But the ability to take that pressure away from yourself, too, as an individual, and

361
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,129
rather than think about,

362
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,830
well, that's the only way I succeed, then you might actually find another level in your

363
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,330
footy as well.

364
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,309
Nick, it's been great to have you as part of a space we call Leader Connect.

365
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,109
We bring groups of people together to collaborate.

366
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,950
And your group's got University of Michigan, Manchester City, the Utah Jazz, Green Bay

367
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,109
Packers, and we love the idea of this collaborative learning.

368
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,930
Can you tell us a bit about that experience for you?

369
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,049
Well, I've probably sold it better than everyone because it's just the best experience I've

370
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,430
had as a coach since finishing up footy.

371
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,630
Especially since being in the, I guess, the head coaching chair, which can be lonely

372
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,130
at times.

373
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:38,210
I've got an amazing group of staff within our footy department and some really key staff

374
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,910
in that that are mentors of mine, even.

375
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,509
But it's something to have someone from outside the organization that you can just jump on

376
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:52,670
a phone call, on a Zoom call, sit and chat and share hurdles, share some of your successes,

377
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,410
ask questions, see what experiences they've gone through.

378
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,170
And as you mentioned, I mean, you read out the group I've got.

379
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,009
When I was told, this is the group you're going to sit with, I was kind of nervous getting

380
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:02,589
on that call.

381
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,549
But they're just fantastic people.

382
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,710
And I love for someone like you is curious enough and open enough to even want to expand

383
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,750
that and go into a second group as well, I believe, which is something we're seeing happen

384
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,369
quite regularly.

385
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,970
Yeah.

386
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,369
Well, as much as I can.

387
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:24,250
As many people as I can listen to, learn from, share ideas, get support from, welcome into

388
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,809
our environment as well.

389
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,049
Yeah.

390
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:26,750
I was lucky enough.

391
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,230
We had one of the members of my first group come over and join us and spend a week with

392
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,890
us just watching how we operate.

393
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,029
She probably thought that that was us doing her a favor.

394
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,589
It was actually me wanting to get some feedback from her on what she saw.

395
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,930
And, you know, she's had some fantastic success over in Michigan.

396
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,529
As many people as you can bounce ideas off and share thoughts with, no one knows everything.

397
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,789
We're all still learning and we always will be.

398
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,829
Even the best coaches in the world are still, in fact, there's probably some of them involved

399
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:55,750
in the Leader Connect.

400
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,029
I'm sure.

401
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,210
I'm sure.

402
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,910
And they're the most curious we find, the ones that are having the most success and

403
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,589
constantly learning and constantly doing exactly what you're doing.

404
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,390
It's a familiar pattern, which is fascinating.

405
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:07,309
We see these patterns.

406
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:11,369
I love asking these questions and you'll know a fair bit about them.

407
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:16,250
But the idea that you can't really lead without understanding your own sense of leadership

408
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,329
and how do you fill up your cup?

409
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,809
You've got a busy schedule.

410
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,690
You've got lots going on.

411
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,970
Three young kids, high pressure job.

412
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,490
What do you do so that you can be at your best?

413
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,130
It's one that obviously everyone asks you.

414
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,849
My CEO, he comes and sits with me and says, what do you do, Nixie?

415
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:38,269
Because I used to play golf and then we had kids and five hours doesn't work walking around

416
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:39,109
a park.

417
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,829
Hard to justify.

418
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,210
You can't walk in the door afterwards and be real with yourself.

419
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,289
It is funny because what actually fills my cup is what I do for a job.

420
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,670
And my wife, my partner, she knows that.

421
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,670
Courtney's massive on that.

422
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:54,609
She goes, I know you don't go to work.

423
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,910
And we'll often.

424
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,829
You know, she has to look after three kids and I don't spend as much time at home as

425
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,210
what I would like to and what she would like me to.

426
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,970
But she knows that what I do is my passion.

427
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:11,750
And so I've got 45 kids that I work with every day and I get to go in and be amongst them.

428
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,190
And, you know, I spent 11 years being one of those kids and loved it.

429
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,930
And so whatever I can do now to share with them, to help them develop faster, to make

430
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,130
them better and ultimately we'll get the ultimate success in a premiership.

431
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,650
And that's where I get my rest from.

432
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,509
I don't come home from work fatigued.

433
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,490
It's unusual, I know.

434
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,490
I work massive hours, but then someone says to me, how do you do that?

435
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,869
I said, well, I'm not working really, am I?

436
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,589
And so it's really just balancing that with family is the hardest part.

437
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:50,849
Making sure that if I don't need to be in the club, that I am at home to support what

438
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,970
we're doing with the kids.

439
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,910
So that's a unique way to think about, isn't it?

440
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,009
When you're absolutely loving what you do.

441
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,470
If that's filling you up, why can't that be the balance that you get?

442
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,490
Have you got one piece of leadership advice that you pass on the most?

443
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:04,190
Yeah.

444
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,529
I mean, the biggest one is one of my values, which we, I mean, it's our overriding value

445
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:09,990
at the club, which is prioritise others.

446
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,309
My theory on life, and it's not just on sporting organisations, I did get a little bit of time

447
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:20,069
out of footy afterwards, about five or six years working in stockbroking, which is probably

448
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,609
about as close to footy as you get.

449
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:25,410
You know, you ride the waves week to week or day to day as the market changes, but the

450
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,869
biggest thing.

451
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:31,089
The biggest thing I found is if you put others first, you just, it's amazing how quickly

452
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,369
the reward comes back to you.

453
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,549
It actually makes you feel better.

454
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,829
I found a children's book when I, when I first took over at the Adelaide Footy Club, I was

455
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,650
sitting in bed reading a children's book to one of my kids and the book was, Have You

456
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,410
Filled a Bucket Today?

457
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,950
And I was sitting there, I was flicking through the pages and I was thinking, this is exactly

458
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,670
my philosophy around life and around, especially football, like when these young guys come

459
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:53,789
in.

460
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,470
And if I could use this book to explain it.

461
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,309
I had to go to Adelaide and I was going to work with Tex Walker, so I knew it had to

462
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,430
be a reasonably, reasonably.

463
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:02,009
A lot of pictures.

464
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,930
It's got a lot of pictures.

465
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,109
We didn't want it to be a year that we had to read this book.

466
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,990
It had to be like a couple of nights where you took it home.

467
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,269
So I ended up using that book with our playing group and that book then went through our

468
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,069
entire staff.

469
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,670
And so up through our admin and we now use that book when we initiate someone and welcome

470
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,690
them to our footy club.

471
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,990
We provide them with a copy of Have You Filled a Bucket?

472
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,170
And it's basically about doing the right thing by others.

473
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,569
It's amazing.

474
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,250
How that makes you also feel better.

475
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,190
And then this is, it's just basically fluent from there where we just look after each other.

476
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,309
And I've got no doubt that's why we had success at Sydney.

477
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,089
I've got no doubt that that still sits in.

478
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,390
I know the culture up there.

479
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,170
I've still got some guys I've played with that are involved and they take real pride

480
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,529
in the way they look after each other.

481
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:47,589
I say that is the highest form of living when you actually get to the level where that is

482
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:52,829
what you do naturally without expecting anything in return is maybe the catch.

483
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,829
And so I'm not, I'm not surprised that that's.

484
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,869
Right at the top of the tree for you.

485
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,069
I'm sure you've got a really clear vision for success at the Adelaide Crows and what

486
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:00,569
that means.

487
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:05,569
Is there specific things that you implement to bring people along the way to help support

488
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,730
that vision and make it their vision as well?

489
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:10,589
Yeah, we talk a lot about, about high performance.

490
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,170
So we talk about and we discuss, look, what is, what is it?

491
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,890
Especially at the moment with where we currently sit.

492
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,970
Members of the group can get a little bit flattened down on themselves when you're not,

493
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,109
you know, we haven't played finals football now for five years.

494
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,369
And that's.

495
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:27,690
Basically the five years that I've been at the footy club.

496
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,950
If you look at it purely from that and you look at, for example, this year, 15th, you

497
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,890
can get pretty down on, we're not having success, but we know that's not the case.

498
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:40,710
So what we go back to is we factor on what is high performance.

499
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,829
Now, high performance for me is getting the best out of yourself that you possibly can.

500
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,369
And then when working in a team, getting the best out of the people that are within that

501
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:49,630
team.

502
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:53,369
And we feel at the moment that we're doing, you know, we are working and having a lot

503
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,410
of success in that area.

504
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,509
And we know that.

505
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,390
Given time.

506
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,609
And that's what we're, I guess we're yearning for at the moment.

507
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,450
It's just that time.

508
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,289
We know if we keep going the way we are, we're going to have, you know, success.

509
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,589
It's going to be seen externally.

510
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,910
It's going to come with wins.

511
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,609
It's going to come with finals football.

512
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,829
And then hopefully, as we've discussed throughout this, it's going to come with that, that day

513
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:18,230
where we can look at each other and smile on a podium and go, it's not about really

514
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,509
today.

515
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:22,410
It's about the 10 years we've spent prior to this, or I better say that differently.

516
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,410
The five years we've spent prior to this.

517
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,369
When we do it next year.

518
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,789
Nice correction there, Nick.

519
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,970
It won't be that long.

520
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,769
It won't be that long.

521
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,769
Curiosity is something we talk about a lot.

522
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:35,589
And we love this idea of sort of having your head in the sky, but your feet on the ground

523
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:38,890
where you understand you've got to do the basics and the fundamentals, but you want

524
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,809
to be implementing and forging new ground.

525
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,910
How do you strike that balance?

526
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:44,769
Yeah.

527
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,069
And it's a really tough one.

528
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,950
It's backing in what you believe in, but also understanding that our game changes all the

529
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,250
time.

530
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:55,250
So if we're talking from a football point of view, we're constantly struggling.

531
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,410
We're searching for what's next.

532
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,269
It happens across all sports.

533
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,569
I was lucky enough to spend some time with Rick Charlesworth back in the day, early, early

534
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,750
coaching days.

535
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,829
And Rick, I mean, he'd had so much experience to that point that he was thinking in completely

536
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:10,990
different spaces to what I was as a young coach.

537
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,589
And it kind of confused me at the time, but looking back on it, I could see where he was.

538
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,089
He was finding what's next.

539
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,809
He'd spent some time during that period, I reckon with Fremantle and with Ross Lyon and

540
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,970
working on what the game of AFL was and where it was going to head.

541
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:27,410
And so I've taken a fair bit out of that.

542
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,970
We're now, without overdoing our opposition or game trends, we are heavily involved in

543
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,490
how do we change the game?

544
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,630
What can we do next that's going to advance us and get us ahead of our opponents?

545
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,789
We talk about communication a lot.

546
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:46,769
Maybe the thing that people focus on the most in terms of how they go about their leadership.

547
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,210
Do you have a mantra when it comes to how you communicate?

548
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,029
Yeah, I do.

549
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,210
I mean, it was probably one of the things I thought was my weapon.

550
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,309
And I had a lot of people talk about that before becoming a head coach.

551
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,450
Oh, you know, Nick, he's such a good communicator.

552
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,369
And so I started to believe the garbage.

553
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:09,250
Since being in the hot chair, I've found it's one of my work-ons.

554
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:11,470
It's one that I've got to improve on.

555
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,490
I'm extremely honest, sometimes to my detriment.

556
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:22,430
And it's a ruthless industry that we work in, but I've got a theory that I don't want

557
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,369
to be chasing my tail.

558
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,730
And something that I've been, you know, where it's been a small lie or something that's

559
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,029
not quite the truth, I'm going to tell it as it is.

560
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,950
And that way, we're not ever sort of dodging bullets.

561
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,769
We're not looking back and saying, oh, actually, no, sorry, we got that wrong.

562
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,009
You know, that might be a small fault.

563
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,430
I think my staff appreciate that, the fact that I'm really open about what we're doing.

564
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,509
Occasionally, I get a raised eyebrow, but it's like, well, I'm just telling you what

565
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:45,849
it is.

566
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,029
So it's probably one of my mantras is like, let's be open and honest.

567
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,569
Let's have a conversation.

568
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,549
I would definitely over-communicate rather than under.

569
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,089
And you know, as a great collaborator, is there an example of where collaboration's

570
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:02,069
been a real win for you in any area of your life?

571
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,450
Well, there's been both.

572
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,390
There's been examples where it hasn't.

573
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,289
Where it's, you know, every now and then you have someone come and just say, Nick,

574
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,410
you just make the call for us.

575
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,349
Go and make the coach's call.

576
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,150
We've got to get this done.

577
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,410
And I'm really open and want to share what it is.

578
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,329
I want to hear your view.

579
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,529
I want to hear what your view is.

580
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,769
So we've worked through that side of things.

581
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,190
But I've got no doubt, the more you collaborate with people, the more,

582
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,769
they feel empowered, the more they feel involved and the better level of work

583
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:32,450
that you get back from them or the better level of enthusiasm or input they're

584
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,190
going to give.

585
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,809
And you have to learn to strike that balance to occasionally go,

586
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:37,369
I'm making a captain's call here.

587
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,569
I've heard all the voices, but this is the path we're going down.

588
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,910
Is that the balance you're still looking for?

589
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,369
Yeah.

590
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,829
I think we've found that over the last few years.

591
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,789
But I think early, you know, especially early sitting in a head coaching seat

592
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:52,910
to actually understand at some point into a three-hour match committee meeting

593
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,170
around one selection.

594
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,190
Spot that's going to play the sub on that weekend.

595
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,170
I think everyone's looking for you to just make a call, Nixie.

596
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,690
You know, we'd have the odd one of those, but I think we've improved on that.

597
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,089
Time to go home on that one.

598
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:04,390
Yeah.

599
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,250
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

600
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,529
Yeah, it's a good one.

601
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:10,089
Cause I've had some, I've had some crackers.

602
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,009
I mean, my mum, my mum was a high level tennis player, but played it down.

603
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:19,630
And it's not until you get older and that you look back on some of the things

604
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,809
she would tell me coming through playing sport that I went, yeah, mum,

605
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:28,190
you know, I thought that was just my mum, but I look back and she was quite successful.

606
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,210
So she was a huge influence and a leader of where I ended up getting to.

607
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:32,910
And so I was dad.

608
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,470
I don't want, I don't want to be disrespectful.

609
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,990
Dad played, you know, reasonable high level footy as well.

610
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,009
But, but mum was a teacher.

611
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,750
So she understood what it meant.

612
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:45,569
Didn't push it on me, but, but had some words of wisdom, you know, across the years.

613
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,210
I started at the Swans.

614
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,150
Ron Barassi was the coach in the first 12 months.

615
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,309
So you don't get many bigger.

616
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,650
As you know, as I mentioned, I broke my leg.

617
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,710
So I didn't spend a lot of time there playing footy, but,

618
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,769
but just watching Ron and how he operated, he,

619
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,210
he was a coach who taught me about attention to detail.

620
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:09,150
You know, I had Paul Roos who, I probably played my worst football under Paul Roos,

621
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,789
but it had nothing to do with him as a coach.

622
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,349
It just happened to be the time of my career where I wasn't at my best,

623
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:20,930
but I watched him bring the best out of some individuals, which I was just in awe of.

624
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,950
And that was through just,

625
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,289
you know,

626
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,250
ultimate communication.

627
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:29,109
And then I've worked alongside some amazing coaches along the journey.

628
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,210
You know, Kenny Hinkley at the moment, who's under some pressure, but he just,

629
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,869
you know, he taught me so much.

630
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,829
Leon Cameron, who I mentioned earlier.

631
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,589
That's just within footy.

632
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,650
Outside of footy, as I mentioned, I got out of footy for a short period of time.

633
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,730
So I had some amazing mentors in the wine industry, in the finance industry,

634
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,769
who sort of put me down a different path and taught me what some of that was about.

635
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,730
It's interesting though, because I did find that,

636
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:56,970
when you talk to corporate industry, they're not quite at the level of sport.

637
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,009
If something happens within a, within a sporting organisation, where there's an understanding that everyone,

638
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,069
if we all work together, we're going to be stronger.

639
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,069
Whereas I found the corporate industry, maybe it was just stockbroking.

640
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,269
We're all a little bit, uh, individual.

641
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,470
It's a bit hard.

642
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:15,690
I found it really hard finishing up and then same thing, getting into some of those spaces.

643
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,369
But you're so feedback driven, you're so team orientated.

644
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:22,410
You're almost programmed that way that it's confronting for other people, isn't it?

645
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,170
They're not used to it.

646
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,630
They're not used to just the feedbacks instantaneous in the world you're operating in now, isn't it?

647
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,509
And that there's a delay, you know, if it ever gets there, perhaps in other spaces.

648
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,670
Yeah, that's a real, it's a standout that you notice.

649
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:41,930
And even, even, even within a footy club, you know, you have a football department, uh, and an administration and an administration area.

650
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:53,109
Even the connection there is a, is a tough one at times because we are, and some would say we're a bit more ruthless in, I guess, in the football side of things than, than what you can be in a corporate.

651
00:30:53,109 --> 00:31:08,150
Well, but if you ask us that that's not ruthless, it's actually just being open and honest, but just being honest, because if we're not, then, you know, sometimes you, sometimes you can be a young lady walks in with his chest puffed out, like thinking you're all it and a bit, you don't actually realize until someone's honest with you.

652
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,230
And it goes back to my first day at Sydney, you know, we don't know that until we're told.

653
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,410
So we're a bit obsessed with this idea of what collaboration can do.

654
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:21,890
And we're seeing great things happen when you bring people with values like yours together, who've got great intentions.

655
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:22,990
Is there,

656
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:30,549
a person you've thought, wow, you know, I'd love to connect and collaborate with that person on clearly what you're doing now or any other aspect of your life?

657
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:31,450
Is there a name that springs to mind?

658
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,049
Yeah.

659
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,410
Yeah.

660
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,990
There's a big one.

661
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,809
He's a big name.

662
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,170
Pep Guardiola.

663
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:40,890
If, if he's, if he's listening, um, no, I've always had a passion for soccer.

664
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:42,230
As you know, I started there.

665
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:48,309
Um, some of our game plans still based around similar to what, you know, some of the best soccer teams in the world play.

666
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:49,529
And it, and it's simple.

667
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,609
It's, um, our guys are all in with it.

668
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,970
But Pep Guardiola.

669
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:59,289
One I've, I've looked at, I've watched obviously some of the documentaries, I'm in a position at the moment where I have a reasonable connection there.

670
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,470
And so it may happen at some stage.

671
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:10,950
I'd really, I'd love to sit down over dinner and just, you know, spend a half an hour, an hour, just listening, just listening to how he operates.

672
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,190
What, what are his values?

673
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:19,569
Cause you don't see, it doesn't quite come out in the documentaries, but there's no doubt he has something that it just works.

674
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,089
Um, and he works with some of the, you know, the biggest names in the world.

675
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:31,789
Um, and he works with some of the biggest names in the world where it must be tough to get them to collaborate or, or, you know, to come together to play the way they do, especially every club he goes to has success.

676
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,289
Well, when that happens next year, and I reckon it's a live chance, we need to chat again.

677
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,369
I'd love to hear, uh, uh, what that interaction would be like.

678
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:42,029
And, you know, you've been a, uh, a great champion in everything you've done.

679
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,990
Your, your reputation and everyone who comes across you has got enormous respect.

680
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:52,210
And five years into, uh, a journey at Lake Crows, I wouldn't be backing against, uh, that success coming, uh, really quickly.

681
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,869
Thanks for joining.

682
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:53,829
Me today, mate.

683
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:54,470
It's great to catch up.

684
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,390
No, thanks to us.

685
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:56,029
Enjoyed it.
