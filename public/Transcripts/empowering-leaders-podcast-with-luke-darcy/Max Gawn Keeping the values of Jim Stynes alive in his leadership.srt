00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,980
Australian football icon Max Gorn is the guest this week on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,740
Max is the captain of the Melbourne Football Club in the AFL, a seven-time All-Australian.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,179
He wears the number 11 in the Melbourne Football Club history, worn by one of their all-time

4
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:25,179
greats, Jimmy Steins, and the former president and a man who had the biggest impact on Max

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:25,879
during his career.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,940
I knew Jim for two and a half years, but he has been my mentor for 16 years, which is

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,380
very weird to say it like that, because he wasn't my mentor in that two and a half years

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,579
of that.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,820
And at the time, I was a young, naive kid, and I'm like, can the president stop texting

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,000
me?

11
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,340
16 years later, I've looked and everything I've done in terms of all my leadership is

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,240
the values that he's installed in me in two years that I didn't know at that time.

13
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,679
And it's unfortunate that a passing is almost what sort of put it in my head that this is,

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,380
oh my God, it's like my wow moment.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,799
Everything I do in my leadership is a clone of Jim.

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,719
The Demons have had many issues in the last 12 months, and as their captain and leader,

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,120
it has been a real balancing act for Max Gorn to be the voice and the face of his club.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,859
This is a lot.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm constantly defending the club, and then there'll be another fire in two weeks.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,560
And the later stuff with track, it's worn me down.

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,819
And I don't like that, because I feel like I've always been able to handle it, but it's

22
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,719
starting to wear me down, because it's something I'm so proud of that I feel like I've had

23
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,739
a good handle of creating, like you said, the most successful era.

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,840
And I can just see it getting chewed, like constantly chipped at, chipped at, chipped

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,540
at, and I'm constantly trying to defend it.

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,140
Hear Max talk about how leadership has changed enormously in his time as captain and dealing

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,200
with the Gen Zs.

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,700
It's a completely different landscape to the one that he had known previously.

29
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,299
You almost do better as a team if you let them run the club and let the 20-year-olds

30
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,239
take you forward, because they'll just take you on a journey.

31
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,200
They've got no stresses or pressures or anxieties that Gen Y millennials have.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,780
They're just loving life.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,680
If you let them take you somewhere, you'd be amazed how far you can go.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,900
It's people like Max Gorn who inspire the work we do at Alita, and we are really privileged

35
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,979
to have Max as part of our Alita Connect program.

36
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,560
Head to alitacollective.com.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,759
We bring together groups of five or six people from around the globe to come together to

38
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,719
learn and to share and to collaborate.

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,699
You don't have to be an AFL legend like Max Gorn to be part of it, but we'd love you to

40
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,219
book a discovery call today.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,759
Big thanks, as always, to Jason Nicholas and the team from Temper Bedding.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
A mattress like no other.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,319
NASA approved.

44
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:30,740
The best.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,319
In bedding.

46
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,240
Check it out today.

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,030
Max Gorn is a seven-time All-Australian and Premiership Captain of the Melbourne Football

48
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,909
Club, regarded as one of the game's greatest ever ruckman, made even more remarkable for

49
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,490
me when he considered he had to overcome two ACL knee reconstructions before his career

50
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,210
had basically even started.

51
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:54,449
His captaincy in Melbourne's 57-year historic drought-breaking Premiership is legendary,

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,370
having been instrumental in the most successful period in the club's history in the modern

53
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,729
era.

54
00:02:59,169 --> 00:02:59,990
Great to catch up with you, Max.

55
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,729
Thanks for taking the time.

56
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:01,289
Thanks to us.

57
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,949
Looking forward to this.

58
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,669
Mum and Dad grew up in New Zealand.

59
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:04,210
I did.

60
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,650
Three years of age, you're living in the South Island of New Zealand.

61
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,729
You played junior rugby union as a kid.

62
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,169
It's a pretty unlikely start for someone to go on and be an all-time great of Australian

63
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:12,550
football.

64
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,689
Were you close to choosing a different path?

65
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,710
Yeah, it's a unique upbringing.

66
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,710
Mum and Dad, not sure if you know too much about South Island, New Zealand, but they're

67
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:28,490
sort of like four hours north-west of Queenstown, and it's the most beautiful part of the world

68
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,530
and the best ski fields in the world, and I've never skied in my life.

69
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,330
I'm sitting there going,

70
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,030
and how have you not let me ski?

71
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:39,949
It's literally the best ski fields in the world, but I really enjoy that my parents are from

72
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,210
the middle of nowhere in New Zealand, and some of the questions that they were asking

73
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,569
when recruiters were rocking around at my house when I was 18, I'm sitting there going,

74
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,750
what are the facilities like?

75
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,129
And they're like, so when the ball goes through for a goal, what happens then?

76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,550
Does it come back to the ... They really were raw, and now they've gone the complete other

77
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,729
way, and Dad's an expert and knows if I'm playing good or bad, but it's been a cool

78
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,750
little journey with that New Zealand heritage.

79
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,129
I played rugby until I was sort of 11, but then quickly learned in Victoria, playing

80
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,889
rugby, you're that kid that's probably going to get bullied throughout school, so I jumped

81
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,610
in and played with my mates and loved it.

82
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:14,990
I can tell you why you haven't skied.

83
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,529
209 centimetres, 110 kilos, that's not conducive, but maybe life after footy for you, but I've

84
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,810
got to go back to the ACLs, and I remember as a player hearing the news, this young Ruckman's

85
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,750
done his second knee, and I remember thinking, that's just going to be such a hard road back

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,269
from there.

87
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,310
Are you surprised that you've done that?

88
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,449
Your body has served you so well to go on and have the success that you've had?

89
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,970
I was naive around what a knee reco was.

90
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,250
In my eyes, I'm like, oh yeah, of course I'm going to get back.

91
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,310
The doctors told me it's a 12-minute injury, and that's all I ... Now looking back, I'm

92
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,189
like, phew, that's a fair scare there.

93
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:56,889
I went knee reco when I was 17 into seven knee arthroscopes into another knee reco.

94
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,129
It was a pretty catastrophic start, and you know when you're first walking to a football

95
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,189
club, all you want to do is earn respect.

96
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,649
You want to earn respect of your teammates, and I'm sitting there 18 months basically

97
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,850
just constantly getting knee surgery after knee surgery after knee surgery, and everyone

98
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,050
is like, okay, well this kid's not going to go anywhere.

99
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,170
The naivety sort of helped me through that, and also one thing that kept me going was

100
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,209
I love fitness.

101
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,410
In my head, when I'm sitting there on a spin bike and everyone else is doing the fun stuff

102
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,670
and out there training, I'm like, well, I would be doing this at 5 a.m. before my 9

103
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,209
to 5, paying to do it at a fitness first, and then having to work a full day.

104
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,149
Instead, I'm in the best facilities in Melbourne.

105
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,410
I'm getting paid to do the spin bike, and I'm doing it at 10 a.m. while watching football.

106
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,610
It's a pretty good job, even though I'd rather be out there.

107
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,889
That sort of kept me sane for that little bit, and I had some guys in there, like Mitch

108
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,949
Clark was long-term when I was long-term, and he was really struggling, highest paid

109
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,269
player at the club, struggling to get out there, and here's me.

110
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,310
I'm just happy as Larry that I'm getting to do a spin bike next to Mitch Clark.

111
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,189
That's a great perspective, Max, to get at a young age.

112
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,269
I must admit, I always try to have that perspective as well.

113
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,569
It's like your worst day in football is maybe someone's best day.

114
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,470
Instead of getting paid to get fit, you're surrounded by 42 players.

115
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,790
Even though you're not out there playing, a lot of people can't get that perspective.

116
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,649
For you as an 18-year-old, that was pretty unique to understand that.

117
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:26,110
Yeah, and I struggle more with it now because that Mitch Clark example, the pressures of

118
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,790
being a starting 18 player, older, family, there's a lot more pressure getting injured

119
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,189
when you're at a later age.

120
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:38,329
But when you're 18, yeah, I was literally happy to be there.

121
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,009
I'm where I want to be.

122
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,610
I've been wanting to be a footballer, and I get to just train in the best facilities

123
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,009
possible.

124
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,730
Little did I know they're not the best facilities.

125
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,250
They're quite far down the bottom, actually, the Melbourne facilities, but they were better

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,209
than the Sandy Dragon ones.

127
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,029
The stuff of your early career is pretty legendary, just how raw you were and smoking darts on

128
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:00,709
the way to training.

129
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,189
I mean, you look back and think, God, I hope.

130
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:08,089
I just didn't have any understanding, really, of how much it took to be a professional athlete.

131
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,389
Yeah, I mean, that story.

132
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,829
So it all sort of channels its way back to I would never change a thing that I've done.

133
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,930
I've learned and grown from everything.

134
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,569
And I smoked a dart on the way to training, which is phenomenal when you think about it.

135
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,949
And if you actually break it down, I was driving the Monash Freeway, and I'm injured.

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,709
And it was a 30-degree morning.

137
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,930
It was one of those ones that was going to be like a 45-degree day.

138
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,910
So it was a really hot morning.

139
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,910
I had all four windows down.

140
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,629
I had no top on and a backwards hat.

141
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,589
That's some detail.

142
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:37,930
Yeah.

143
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:43,069
And I'm driving in the far right lane of the Monash, and I pass Kyle Cheney, and Kyle

144
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,370
Cheney looks at me.

145
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,129
And so this is Kyle Cheney's point of view.

146
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:47,990
I don't see Kyle Cheney.

147
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,509
So he's seen me at my best, like all four windows down, not even noticing that someone's

148
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,110
seen me, just chewing back a dart.

149
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,350
But now, like fast forward 16 years, as captain, I just understand that not everyone is a private

150
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,810
school kid.

151
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,269
That's grown up with professionalism and has been wanting to be a footballer, like

152
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,110
a Jack Viney from day one.

153
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:14,009
There's some people that are going to come in like I did and not understand a thing about

154
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,269
what AFL clubs are about.

155
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,290
And it's put a lot more perspective in.

156
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,430
And ideally, I don't have the dart.

157
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,610
And ideally, Jake Bowie, when he comes in, doesn't smoke a dart, but creating a safe

158
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,230
place for him to feel a little more comfortable in that transition to be an adult and a professional

159
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,730
footballer.

160
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,389
Which may be the genius you're captain, Sam.

161
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,629
I want to talk about that in a moment.

162
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,529
I've got to go back.

163
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,330
You come to training, tops off, you're blissfully unaware that one of your teammates has seen

164
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,289
you driving down the fruit.

165
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,610
How did that play out from the feedback point of view in the club?

166
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,289
Yeah, I thought it wasn't a common thing.

167
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:47,629
It makes it sound like if I'm having a dart at 6.30, it was a common thing.

168
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,529
I think it was, I don't know why, I can't put my head around it, it was a one-off type.

169
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,129
It wasn't one-off.

170
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,149
I'd obviously had some darts, but, and I remember, so Kyle Cheney told Jack Grimes, best friends,

171
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,370
and Jack Grimes' leadership group, maybe even vice captain at that point.

172
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,889
And it filtered around.

173
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,049
The group didn't get to me until nine days.

174
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,169
So I've got some feedback around that as well.

175
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,809
The fact that it took them so long, it just festered within the group for nine days.

176
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,990
Everyone knew but me.

177
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,070
Anyway, I remember there was a nine-man leadership group back then.

178
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,970
That was quite popular to have as many in the leadership group as possible.

179
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,690
And there was a semi-circle and I was standing in the middle and Brad Miller started things

180
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,429
off and he goes, you're doing whatever it takes to be the best footballer you can be

181
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:26,929
for this football club.

182
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,950
Whatever it takes was our motto.

183
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,350
And I'm obviously unaware that I've been caught.

184
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:32,509
Yeah.

185
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:33,250
I think I am.

186
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:36,769
Obviously the knee is hurting me at the moment, but I really want to be out there, but I think

187
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:37,629
I'm working hard in the gym.

188
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:43,529
And then Brent Maloney, who's hard left, like I couldn't even really see him, goes, so you

189
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,330
weren't smoking?

190
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,470
I'm like, smoking?

191
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,570
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,649
And then I'm starting to get real hot in my chest.

193
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,029
I'm like, oh shit, what's happened here?

194
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,970
And then he goes, oh, Kyle Cheney reckons that he saw you on the way to train.

195
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,830
And I'm like, oh shit.

196
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:58,149
Yeah.

197
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah.

198
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,370
And then I went to water.

199
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,950
Famous Wayne Carey line.

200
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:02,250
Denied.

201
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,529
Denied.

202
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:02,830
Denied.

203
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,929
And then when caught, deny.

204
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:05,190
I went with that.

205
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,809
And I said, oh, mum and dad smoke.

206
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:08,929
My brothers smoke.

207
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,490
There's just smoking everywhere in my family.

208
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,370
It's hard to get away from.

209
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,169
None of them smoke.

210
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,169
I just ran them all under the bus.

211
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,990
And then, so I eventually, a young kid who didn't want to take accountability, I eventually

212
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,649
took accountability and we grew, but it was quite a unique moment.

213
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,929
I love talking to you about the late, great Jim Stines and the fact that he saw in you

214
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,169
something that maybe others didn't see when that was all going on and others in that era

215
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,690
might've been quick to pass on.

216
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,929
And for those who don't know, he was the pioneer of the Irish game, won a Brownlow medal as

217
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,309
an Irishman, lucky enough to have played against him a number of times and just the most wonderful

218
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,330
person you've ever met, Jim.

219
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,950
How important was it to have him as the president of Melbourne Football Club, see something

220
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,210
in you when that was a pretty rough start?

221
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,929
Yeah, looking, sort of looking back now, you realise with my work with Reach, that Jim

222
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:01,970
had a strength in adolescent youth that were, had a troubled, troubling.

223
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,549
To work out what they wanted to be and how they wanted to get there.

224
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,529
And that's what Reach basically does.

225
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,029
It just empowers young people to be the best versions of, of, of themselves.

226
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:16,250
So when Jim, I hadn't done much Reach work and I, to be fair, I didn't really know much

227
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,669
about Jim.

228
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,210
I'd, these playing days were before me, watching football and I just knew he was the president.

229
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,549
I don't know well Jim, I only know sick Jim.

230
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,750
He was sick the day I got there.

231
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,389
And sick Jim is an incredible person.

232
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,649
So I'm presuming well Jim would have been phenomenal.

233
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:31,509
Yeah.

234
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,389
I remember the first day, like we had pick one, pick two, pick 10, pick 18.

235
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,690
Tap Scott, Gisbert's, Trengrove, Scully.

236
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,070
Massive draft hall.

237
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,330
Functions galore.

238
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,769
And there's one, all our parents came in and the whole club's there.

239
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,250
And Jim just randomly said, I'm excited about this kid and made me stand up.

240
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,309
And I'm standing up and I'm like, what's going on here?

241
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,529
Like, there's a fair draft hall here.

242
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,250
And he just pinpointed me straight away, moved Matthew Warnock out of my number, out of number

243
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,889
37 to put me in 37.

244
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,289
And just constantly checked in.

245
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,590
And weekly, just constantly.

246
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,129
And if you remember what Jim was going for, he was president while cancer, family.

247
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,029
And he just kept checking in with me every week.

248
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,049
And now looking back, I'm like, oh yeah, I was a reach kid in his eyes.

249
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:19,289
I was a kid that didn't know how I was going to get there, but had the potential to get

250
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:19,490
there.

251
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:21,529
And he knew that a mentor would help that.

252
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,429
He's a man ahead of his time.

253
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:29,490
That foundation is so prevalent in today, youths that struggle with anxiety and a desire

254
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,470
to get to where they want.

255
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,250
And the fact that he saw that in me and I was blissfully unaware, that's what he was

256
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,110
doing there forever in debt.

257
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,690
And then for you to go on and be this cultural change maker at Melbourne Football Club,

258
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,850
premiership captain of the drought-breaking premiership, having Jim take it, there's

259
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,750
something, almost the hair stand on the back of your neck with that.

260
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,690
Jim wasn't alive to see that, unfortunately.

261
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,549
But do you feel his presence?

262
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,370
Do you feel, I can only imagine how much joy that would have given Jim and the Steins family.

263
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,149
Yeah, I don't think, I don't think he ever saw anything good for me.

264
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,769
Actually, I reckon, I feel like he passed away before I even pulled my finger out.

265
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,629
So I'm very lucky I get to wear number 11 now as well, which is also his number.

266
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,929
And I get a unique moment before I play every, every, every, every week where I get to just

267
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:14,529
look at the number.

268
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,590
And the first thing that comes up is, is, is Jim and more along the lines of how hard

269
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:27,070
his life was and how easy football is, how, how, how he was doing stuff to stay alive,

270
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,450
drinking his own urine, everything just to stay alive and be the best.

271
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,950
Dad and president he could be at that point and husband.

272
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,090
And I'm just going out there playing football.

273
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,549
Like I just put things into perspective for me, but yeah, it's such a unique storyline

274
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,509
that the fact that we're both rucks, um, he won a Brownlow, I'm going to win one tonight.

275
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,769
It's just, we're very, it's very similar.

276
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,029
The best leaders for me are authentically themselves.

277
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:53,190
I look at you and I just think you are a hundred percent authentically you.

278
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,190
Every time I listen to you, it just pours out of you.

279
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,470
Was that something you've consciously tried to be?

280
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,450
Or is it just you being?

281
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:08,950
The harder, I mean, very hard being yourself in AFL, let alone being someone you're not

282
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,110
in AFL, you found out pretty quickly if you're, if you're trying to hide and in particular

283
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,110
on the football field, if you're out there not being, if I'm out there not being Max

284
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,090
Gorn, trying to be Aaron Sandlands or Dean Cox, trying to be clones of them, there's

285
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,909
no way I'm going to get to where I got to.

286
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,149
So it was some learnings that I learned early on.

287
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,029
I remember about my six or seven year, year, it looked like I could be a leader.

288
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,429
I certainly, I was one.

289
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:35,710
I was one of those leaders that grew from, I had the playing group in terms of friends

290
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,610
and how could I make that next step rather than let's say the Jack Viney approach where

291
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,070
he had the standards and the, the values nailed.

292
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,289
And how does he approach to become, um, uh, a voice for all 45.

293
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,230
So I was the other way.

294
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,309
And I remember a lot of my feedback was just like, Dars, if I needed to sit you down and

295
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,769
give you some feedback, Gorn, you just don't always put a joke in.

296
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,389
Like you don't have to just hit me up.

297
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,090
Just, just say what you need to say.

298
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,389
Don't.

299
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,909
Start of a joke and finish of a joke.

300
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,210
And like, it was a lot around this class clown stuff.

301
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,230
And I battled with that for a while as this young leader.

302
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,870
And then it just sort of hit me.

303
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,429
I'm like, Dars, you'd feel uncomfortable if I did a meeting and I didn't start with a

304
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:14,649
joke because that is me.

305
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,110
You know me as that person.

306
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,370
So how awkward would it be if I came in and was serious, did not smile once.

307
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,429
And we had a minute chat and then we walked off.

308
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,610
Like, are you better off being the Max Gorn during that discussion?

309
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,230
Um, and it was once I sort of realized that, that,

310
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,470
um, this is me and if I get voted in to be a leader and

311
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,470
that's, that's why, because this is me and I, that's challenging.

312
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,990
I have a diary at home.

313
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,110
Um, you'd love to say it.

314
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,809
I write pretty much every conversation I've had good or bad points that I can do from.

315
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,269
It's a Jim science coming out of me.

316
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,309
I'm really interested in conversations and relationships.

317
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:54,230
And, um, so I think I'm an overthinker massively at nighttime, but when I'm

318
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,450
during the day, I'm just in the flow.

319
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm, I'm, I'm me.

320
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,610
That's brilliant, Max.

321
00:15:59,610 --> 00:15:59,870
And it.

322
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,169
It doesn't surprise me because you hear these stories, you know, in the

323
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,850
AFL world, you know, one of your teammates having a challenge, Clayton

324
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,389
Oliver publicly having some dramas.

325
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,690
And then you hear he moves into your house, you know, not long after, you

326
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,929
know, you and your wife have just had your second baby that to me is that.

327
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,309
Natural empathy that seems to come out of you is again, that just your style

328
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,750
and you're going to be you all the way along.

329
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:21,110
Yeah.

330
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,409
That didn't go down as well with Jess, um, surprisingly, uh, but now I'd like

331
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,690
if you, if there's an article about Clayton in the paper.

332
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,289
Jess is really patriotic.

333
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,230
She's like, what is that article?

334
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,009
Clayton's my boy.

335
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,090
She's like, she's gone full.

336
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,870
I'm his mom now.

337
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,629
Um, no, I just, there's no other option to me.

338
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,590
We had a, we had a really long chat one, one night, myself and Clayton.

339
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,330
And at the end I said, it needs to happen.

340
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,330
Done that you need to come into me.

341
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:45,909
And he said, yep.

342
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,809
So we made it happen.

343
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,850
It was about a month because it was off season.

344
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,870
I was going away at different points as well.

345
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,250
Still.

346
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,929
Um, he almost came with me to Fiji.

347
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,710
That was an interesting little, it was something that we both, um, felt like

348
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,450
we needed to happen where we're really close.

349
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,750
He's come out and had an unbelievable year as a person.

350
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,269
Um, and hopefully we'll continue to grow.

351
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:13,109
And Clayton was a really nice moment for me as a leader to see that, um, change

352
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,390
happen with the, with the hours and the commitment you put in.

353
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:20,950
Makes you the premiership captain of this legendary drought

354
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,809
breaking premiership, 57 years.

355
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,609
And then you oversee the most successful period really for, for five decades of

356
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,690
the football club, consistently top four.

357
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,490
And competing regularly, but it feels as though in that period, there has been

358
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,750
more spot fires and more dramas and more criticism of the Melbourne football club

359
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,089
than maybe ever, and you've been at the coalface of that all the time and had to

360
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,049
be the spokesperson under these pressure situations.

361
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,029
How challenging is that?

362
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,210
But

363
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:52,309
yeah, this is, um, I spoke about the diary, this one, this stuff gets written

364
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,890
down a lot when there's constant spot fires.

365
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,529
Is it something that I'm doing and I don't have a massive ego in leading, so I'm

366
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,890
happy for any sort of feedback and I'm happy to take the blame.

367
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,230
And so I, I, I constantly work through this and see what could I have done better?

368
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,230
Is this a direct reflection on, um, the group that, uh, that we've

369
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,410
created as a leadership group?

370
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,690
But yeah, there, there, there has been a lot and just by nature.

371
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,210
So I do a lot of media work, um, which we were talking about before, and I really

372
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,470
enjoy it and I don't find any stresses around it.

373
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,369
I don't feel like it makes me need to go play well on the weekend.

374
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:29,230
I just really enjoy, um, that side of the game.

375
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,329
By nature, I ended up being the person talking about it because I was on radio

376
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,589
Monday, Friday, every week.

377
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,849
Um, and clubs like a little bit of time.

378
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,230
They like a little bit of time to write a statement or to get in, get on the front

379
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,309
foot, but here's me addressing rumors Monday to Friday with Marty Sheargold, who

380
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,390
wasn't the best person to address rumors with, cause he, he went relatively hard.

381
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,829
Um, sort of did the heavy, the heavy lifting for me, but it put me in a

382
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,150
tough, tough situation a lot of times.

383
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,049
Um, I remember there was an Oz kick launch with Joel Smith.

384
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,450
I remember after I spoke, it was about 15, um, people that were going hard.

385
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,130
The journos after they spoke, I just walked to the other side of the sponsors banner.

386
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,509
I just sat down and I just, I couldn't move.

387
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,849
Like I'd almost had like an eight, like a panic attack, almost like I'm like, that

388
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:16,190
was a lot like, what have I got myself into?

389
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,930
This is a lot.

390
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,529
I'm constantly defending the club and then there'll be another fire in two weeks.

391
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:25,690
And the, and the latest stuff with track, it really war it's worn me down.

392
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,990
Um, and I don't, I don't like that cause I feel like I've always been able to

393
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,170
handle it.

394
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,710
But it's, it's starting to wear me down because it's something I'm so proud of

395
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,890
that I feel like I've had a good handle of creating, like you said, the most

396
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,930
successful era of, and I can just see it getting chewed, like constantly chipped

397
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,509
at, chipped at, chipped at, and I'm constantly trying to defend it.

398
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,289
Um, and I know what's happening in the four walls, but I just, you, you're

399
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,529
never going to trust that with nonstop spot fires.

400
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,750
So it's been a, it's been a delicate little time.

401
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,390
Well, people to understand, you know, as you said, you're, you're an

402
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,569
Oz kick ambassador, you're doing great things for your football club.

403
00:19:58,569 --> 00:19:59,049
You're representing.

404
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,230
Your football club in a great way.

405
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,549
And then these stories break out, you know, of, uh, teammates who you love

406
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,089
and their friends, and they've had, uh, mistakes and Joel Smith had this, you

407
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,150
know, really challenging time and your great friend, Kristen Petra, you've got

408
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,549
hardened political journalists who for a living trip up professionals who speak

409
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,230
every day in front of press conferences.

410
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,250
You're at a bounce jumping castle center.

411
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,930
So that's not the environment.

412
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,930
You haven't got a team of advisors saying, guess what, Max, here's the

413
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,250
next question coming your way.

414
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,869
That is a pressure that I don't think.

415
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,349
People could quite possibly understand, but you've dealt with that.

416
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:34,329
And I think your resilience bands can be pretty thick.

417
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:39,109
Isn't it from there on a hundred percent and especially, you know, deep down what

418
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:44,170
you think, what the club thinks and what Joel thinks in that case, or with the

419
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,369
track stuff, you know, tracks point of view, you know, the clubs want to, and

420
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,690
you know, your point of view, but you've got to somehow combine them all to be

421
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,730
the most loving message for 70,000 members.

422
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,910
And it's, it can be quite challenging, but you trip yourself up if

423
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,170
you're not speaking complete truth.

424
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,569
So I just constantly just try and speak truth.

425
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:03,789
Sometimes I don't delve into truths that I don't really want to hear, but I don't, I

426
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:08,230
don't lie and that's where you can get caught up or I don't, I don't mislead the

427
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,630
truth.

428
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,950
I didn't, I can catch myself in that because sometimes I say a bit too much

429
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,630
and the club can go, come on, Max, we need you to pull back there or track

430
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,250
would be like, why'd you say that?

431
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,670
Or Clayton or Joel, anyone who I've spoken about this year.

432
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,150
Um, so, but I feel comfortable with everything that has been out there.

433
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,470
And that's your genius, Max.

434
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,049
That is your Dean.

435
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:27,849
I hope you never change.

436
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:28,250
You won't.

437
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:28,710
Uh, I'm sure you won't.

438
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,549
I'm sure don't need me to say that to you, but the truth always works to me.

439
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,589
Footy clubs always try and bend a little bit, maybe leave a few things out, but

440
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:40,289
I think you've been this incredible leader because of exactly that authentic

441
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,490
and, uh, and telling the truth.

442
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,769
We're this great privilege to cross over with you in this space.

443
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:45,390
We call a leader.

444
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,170
We bring together groups of five or six, and you've got so many diverse interests

445
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,650
outside of what you do in football.

446
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,950
Can you tell us about that experience in a letter connect?

447
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,410
I've really enjoyed it personally, because I've just, the year it's come into my

448
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,430
life is the year where I've had.

449
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,990
So many challenges and to have, uh, I've got a, quite a diverse group, some

450
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,569
hospitality geniuses, um, and then I've got, um, uh, the basketball players

451
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,910
association mastermind in Jacob Holmes.

452
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,369
So, um, it's been, it's been quite fun.

453
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,029
I'm I'm the athlete in the group.

454
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,930
So they love the footy dosage that I give them.

455
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,309
Um, but I also like, it's funny.

456
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,750
I don't know.

457
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,630
What's happened to the insurance me if it's not on Herald sun, but they know

458
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,089
what's happening in a Melbourne football club, so they, they almost start the

459
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:28,410
conversation.

460
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,809
For, for me, and then I'm able to, but the ideas I've bounced off, um, to be

461
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,109
able to know what I'm doing is the right thing or the wrong thing, or, um, to

462
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:39,890
work workshop, a couple of things to be able to be the best leader I can.

463
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,509
I've certainly really enjoyed it.

464
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,190
You've got a diverse interests.

465
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,289
I'm looking at the Lululemon ambassador.

466
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,289
I'm sitting in front of, and you've got a couple of restaurants and family's

467
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,670
got some hospitality history.

468
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,190
I think you might've started a lawn mowing business or something in the early

469
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,910
days, sorry, my apologies.

470
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,410
You'd be made tables for a living.

471
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,730
You'd be, has that been helpful for you to have all these other things?

472
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,890
And you're doing an amazing job when you front up in the meat.

473
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,210
Is that helped you along the way?

474
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,410
My wife always says this, but my parents, uh, the biggest impulse people known to

475
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,269
mankind, if they want something, they'll have it an hour later, or if they want to

476
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,490
go somewhere, they're on a plane, they're gone.

477
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:17,630
And I've got a bit of that.

478
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,509
I like to, if I think of something, I'm like, I'm all in on it.

479
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,269
And Jess is quite the opposite.

480
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,430
So we're actually a really good match because we can, we can get it out a tiny

481
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,250
bit, but I went to.

482
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,609
Cafe cause I wanted to do, um, cafes and I walked into a cafe and I loved the

483
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:37,250
table while I was sitting on and said, well, you know what, actually let's do

484
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,670
tables.

485
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,910
So I started doing tables and we did tables for two years and we closed the

486
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,509
doors because it was too busy, which is phenomenal.

487
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,190
We are, we outsourced and said, oh, do you want to do the tables?

488
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,049
And the, the, um, the regulation tables, regulation, tables, dining

489
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,849
tables, basically dining tables.

490
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,789
And you were that busy?

491
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:54,809
Well, that busy.

492
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,369
And we're working one day a week because of that was our day off.

493
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,369
And we outsourced and said, oh, we've got all these orders.

494
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,529
Maybe we just go get someone full time to do it.

495
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:03,910
And then we didn't really enjoy that.

496
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,250
It wasn't the passion piece that we thought we were.

497
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,529
And then our markup wasn't as good as well.

498
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,289
Cause we're outsourcing.

499
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,769
We're like, oh, let's just, let's just, let's just call it quits.

500
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:16,089
We had, I think we had about 20 orders to get done in a month at one point.

501
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:19,150
And the table takes one table, takes a whole day sort of set up.

502
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,289
And then you've got to, you've got to, it's got to glue together.

503
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:21,890
And then it's not ready.

504
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,630
And we on the tools on that day off on the tools and hard day off, um,

505
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,190
standing back, standing back tables.

506
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:27,730
Amazing.

507
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,809
Yeah, really love that.

508
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:30,789
But hospital was always my dream.

509
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,569
Um, my mom is my hero.

510
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:35,869
I love, I love, I love both my parents, but my mom's my hero.

511
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:40,609
I wanted to do everything my mom made to seem like was the best job in the world.

512
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,829
Dad, obviously he's in earth moving.

513
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:45,250
That's just, it wasn't something that I found passionate.

514
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,410
My other brothers do, but it wasn't something that I wanted.

515
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,630
I wanted hospital hospital.

516
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:53,089
So when the opportunity came up to start a bar, I initially, like I said, I wanted

517
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:57,349
cafes, but there's not an amazing amount of money in cafe, um, and the wine bar

518
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,009
sort of was the trend at that time, six years ago when I could, let's jump on it.

519
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,589
And I've really enjoyed it.

520
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:07,769
I've to be fair, I'm probably the fine answer, like, and I get my role.

521
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,890
I'm there once a week, once a fortnight, I'm on my laptop on zero, maybe twice a week.

522
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,150
Like I'm not doing a hell of a lot.

523
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,150
I'm looking, um, I get involved in any sort of hiring and firing and make sure I upskill

524
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,549
myself.

525
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:24,210
But the day I finished is the day I want to go full into one myself.

526
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,029
I want to be everything I can do.

527
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,910
Keep the same team.

528
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,329
They're a great team.

529
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:31,950
We've had, but I want to be a bit more hands-on and create and do what my mom made

530
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,109
to seem like was my dream.

531
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:36,589
Cause that's, I'm getting a bit of that dosage with the two restaurants I'm in, but

532
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:40,410
I'm also, I'm delegating to my two business partners and they're doing a lot of the

533
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:40,710
work.

534
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,069
Look forward to saying that, uh, that day come, hopefully get some, uh, some big

535
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:46,329
years ahead of you, which I'm sure you have.

536
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,549
We love the patterns of what leadership looks like in different spaces.

537
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,009
And yours is such an incredible story.

538
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,210
And this idea that it's hard to lead someone else without the sense of self

539
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,670
leadership.

540
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,390
What do you do?

541
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,309
And all that busy world.

542
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:58,650
You're, you're a father of two.

543
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:01,630
You've got enormous amounts of things to juggle and balance.

544
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,569
How do you fill your own cup up max so that you can be the leader you want to be?

545
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,609
I'm a, I'm up and down like everyone else.

546
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,089
My relationship with my phone is a dangerous one.

547
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,730
And I'd say most people my age would say that.

548
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,990
And I've created some really good self protocols around that.

549
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,569
I, um, in the back end of weeks, I, I turn my phone off.

550
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,069
Literally turn it off.

551
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,630
Literally turn it off.

552
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,589
How do you communicate?

553
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,549
Can be bad.

554
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:25,170
I have hours where I turn it on.

555
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,349
Yeah.

556
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:25,450
Yeah.

557
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:26,809
You can find yourself.

558
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,289
Just.

559
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:28,250
Just spiraling.

560
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,890
But also the positive endorphins I get from not using my phone is phenomenal.

561
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,289
And I never thought I'd get that.

562
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:37,750
So obviously people say just to stay away from social, it's good to keep yourself away

563
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,130
from that.

564
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,430
Can I delve into that for a bit?

565
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,289
So what, what if you, if you're having a back end of the week, less phone time, how do you

566
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:43,809
structure it?

567
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,750
So I would be in the morning, it'd be on to what alarm, although who uses an alarm these

568
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,809
days, you normally naturally wake up to the three year old that's in your bed, but alarm

569
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:53,970
and whatnot, just to start the day.

570
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,390
And then that, it just goes off.

571
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,089
It goes off.

572
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:56,569
Either.

573
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,089
Uh, do not disturb.

574
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:02,869
I've created my own do not disturb, which is like, if it's a phone call that calls twice,

575
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,150
I'll pick up.

576
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,269
If not, I don't say it till.

577
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,029
So the wife can ring twice and you're like, okay, I've got to take this one.

578
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,450
Until the kids are asleep that night.

579
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,529
Full day without.

580
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:11,910
Full day.

581
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,029
That's normally like a Thursday, Friday for a Saturday game.

582
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:17,049
I would, I would sort of really ease up.

583
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,089
And would you jump on after bedtime and just check and say, Hey, there might be some business

584
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:21,849
I need to attend to.

585
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,170
Pretty much.

586
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,970
And then in the world of social media, I do have a brand there as well.

587
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,349
So you actually need to upload stuff every now and then.

588
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,650
And, um, like Lululemon don't want someone who doesn't use social media at all.

589
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,589
So I've got to do my part there.

590
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:37,190
Um, but that's something I've found really enjoyable.

591
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:44,089
And the person I am on Thursday, Friday compared to the person I am Monday, Tuesday is phenomenal.

592
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,809
The, the, the, the dad I am, the husband I am more importantly, I think more husband,

593
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:48,990
I reckon I'm always a good dad.

594
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,670
I'm a better husband and I give more time to, to Jess in that back half of the week.

595
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,670
And then, um, it just snowballed.

596
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:03,230
When you're a great person at home, the person you are in your workplace is even better making

597
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,230
sure I channel all the right energy.

598
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,470
Um, and I've also got some great wellness routines.

599
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:09,069
Um, I'm lucky enough.

600
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:12,829
It must be nice to have a sauna at home, but I do have a sauna at home and to spend an

601
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,170
hour in there and my phone does not work in the sauna.

602
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,630
So the wifi doesn't go in there.

603
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,650
So I actually can't use it.

604
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,069
So it's an hour of just thoughts, music, really relaxing, which I enjoy.

605
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,809
It's a brilliant piece of advice.

606
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,930
I love how you've been able to, and then equate that.

607
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,130
To being happier.

608
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,890
And then you, as you said, your performances are always at an incredibly high level.

609
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,390
This idea of impacting people.

610
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,710
We see a lot.

611
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,630
Is there been one piece of leadership advice that you, you take and pass on to others?

612
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:38,990
Yeah, there is.

613
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,289
And it's a little bit around what we just spoke about.

614
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,609
The best version of yourself is the best leader that they can be.

615
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,190
So not trying to be someone you're not always reflecting on what you could do better, but

616
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,190
then also making sure that you're your best self.

617
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:54,410
We do this.

618
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,730
We do this thing at the club that.

619
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,390
I've lived and died by now.

620
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,329
I've got a whiteboard at home.

621
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,309
So Jess hates this.

622
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:03,009
She wants to be all just on your phone.

623
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:07,509
Damn Cal, like everything goes in the same calendar, but I hate using my phone as I've

624
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:07,910
just said.

625
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,990
So I've got this whiteboard as big as this wall that has like a month up there and I'm

626
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,869
a visual person.

627
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,109
I love seeing it all there, but I set up my week to be the best version I can be.

628
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:23,710
So I know on Monday I need to go in the beach at some time, have a sauna.

629
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,769
I need to have uninterrupted time.

630
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,150
My kids, I need to read a book and I need to write in my diary.

631
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,849
And then what I need to do Tuesday all the way to Thursday, Friday, you've heard is no

632
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:33,190
phone.

633
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,049
Um, and that's set up my week.

634
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:36,289
And I do that every Sunday night.

635
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:39,930
I set my wake up and that allows me to be the best version of me.

636
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,430
And then bang, when I'm the best version of me come the time that's, let's say it's

637
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,549
midday till five.

638
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:46,509
I'm at the club on Monday.

639
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,150
I've delegated that time around it to be the best version.

640
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,450
I can be a 12 to five as a captain, which is a genius.

641
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,369
I'm the same.

642
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,190
I'm a, I'm a handwriting.

643
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,210
I don't have a note of that's typed up, but I'm a bit the same.

644
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,430
I like to see stuff and I like to hand write stuff down.

645
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,410
I'm a bit the same, but that idea you start on Sunday night and your week set up and you

646
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,089
know, you're setting yourself up for success.

647
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:07,890
That's a great thing to share.

648
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,829
The next dimension I want to talk to you about is, is vision.

649
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:13,349
And you've clearly got a vision for what success looks like.

650
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:18,210
And in a elite performance environment, has there been one type of visionary leader that's

651
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,410
really inspired you along the way?

652
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,329
I've got a pretty good one.

653
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:25,589
I work with in, in, in Goody, he challenges me, but more importantly, from the vision

654
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:25,769
point.

655
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:30,470
From the point of view, he always is talking about what is going to be the fallout from

656
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,990
this decision.

657
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,210
Like he's always looking ahead.

658
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,049
So him now, but in, in terms of early parts of my leadership, obviously the values I get

659
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,450
from my parents, you don't realize how much of a clone you are as your parents do.

660
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,470
You start to grow up a little bit and you go, why do I do that?

661
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,069
And then you look at your dad, you go, oh, that makes sense.

662
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,950
Like he's literally doing the exact same thing.

663
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,849
Um, so their values and then Jim, like honestly, the G I know I knew Jim for two years, two

664
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:55,750
and a half, two and a half years.

665
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:01,569
But he has been my mentor for 16 years, which is very weird to say it like that.

666
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,329
Cause I, he wasn't my mentor in that two and a half years of that.

667
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,809
And at the time I was a young naive kid and I'm like, can the president stop texting me?

668
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:16,069
But like 16 years later, I've looked in like everything I've done in terms of all my leadership

669
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:20,410
is the values that he's installed in me in two years that I didn't know at that time.

670
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,750
And it's unfortunate that a passing is almost what sort of put it in my head.

671
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:28,569
That this is, oh my God, like it's like my wow moment.

672
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,250
Like I wish I had that wow moment while he was there, but everything I do in my leadership

673
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,829
is a clone of Jim and a mixture of my parents.

674
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,049
I just love that legacy.

675
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,690
As I said, having the pleasure of knowing Jim for a long period and when he was well

676
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,990
and playing against him and to think impact you and then thousands of reach kids who've

677
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,410
probably got similar stories that are still being impacted by what he did for them is

678
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,690
quite incredible.

679
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,750
Curiosities are where we're here all the time in people that are successful like you or

680
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:58,509
I want to ask you, is there a rabbit hole you've gone down recently you can share with

681
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:03,069
us where your curiosity has been piqued and you just can't help but go after something?

682
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,390
Is that something that resonates with you?

683
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,170
Yeah.

684
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:12,109
Well, the impulsiveness of my decision-making sometime, but I'm certainly in a, I'm in a

685
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:15,549
space, I'm not sure if this is where you wanted to go, but I'm in a space right now where

686
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,829
I'm an older captain and I've been at the helm for a bit of an unsuccessful three years.

687
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,910
I mean, the way it depends how you look at it.

688
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,730
We've won a lot of games of football and been in top four, but we haven't been able

689
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,730
to get back to that, to that glory.

690
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,069
And then there has been spot fires of different little cultural stuff.

691
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:37,109
And I'm currently sitting there going, is it still right for me to be the guy who leads

692
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:37,490
the team?

693
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:42,950
I'll still lead in my own way, no matter what, but is it worth having someone new?

694
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,950
I've always been a believer and this counter acts counterintuitive to what I just said,

695
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,990
but I've always been a guy thinking I'll pass it on at a good time.

696
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,710
And this is not a good time to be fair for a new captain.

697
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:00,329
So I feel like I might continue on, but like I'd love to pass it on and a new captain can

698
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:01,670
come in and there's no pressure.

699
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,430
So that's probably what's in my head at the moment.

700
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,750
I'm trying to work out where I sit in my, in my, in my leadership space, where I sit

701
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,230
with a group.

702
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,289
I'd also like the idea of potentially just sitting there in my last couple of years in

703
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:20,990
the back row and not in the political press conferences and seeing if I can enjoy some

704
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,670
footy in the back end.

705
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,130
Brilliant.

706
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,630
You've got the succession planning in your mind and the way you're thinking about that.

707
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,990
I think the way people communicate might be the thing that we hear the most, that people

708
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,150
really have a strategy on that.

709
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,549
We've heard about, you know, your discipline with your phone, but have you got a mantra

710
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,990
in the way that you communicate in the role that you've got?

711
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:44,410
So the, the, the journal, so I've got sort of everything in terms of the last time I

712
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,789
spoke to someone, if I'm speaking to them again.

713
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,890
So I've got everything written down, like you said, we're, we're, we're both visual

714
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,990
people, so it's written down.

715
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:55,390
So I've got that to look at before and look at after.

716
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,589
It's a reflect, but I tell myself every time I go into, especially hard conversations,

717
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,309
obviously hard conversations, the easy, the positive conversations are fine, but you walk

718
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:09,329
in and just before I start, I'm like, be Max Gorn, which is, I mean, like I said, it's

719
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:13,489
harder than you think it is because it can be quite challenging with the different stresses

720
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,590
and anxieties in the world.

721
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,550
But as soon as I start talking, I'm like, be Max Gorn.

722
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:19,230
And then it's just, it flows.

723
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,369
The harder conversation isn't necessarily that hard.

724
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,070
I love, I love the way you sum that up again.

725
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,349
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration.

726
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,349
Max, and the idea that people working better out of their silos and coming together.

727
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,030
Have you got an example of a collaboration in any area of your life that's worked for

728
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,150
it?

729
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,789
Uh, I mean, that's, it's almost like leadership groups in a sense.

730
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:42,329
You can, you, you have strong ideas as, uh, as a captain, like this would be bored.

731
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,510
This is any sort of industry has these high level leadership meetings.

732
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,210
I really enjoy ours because we have so many different point of views.

733
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,130
I just love the idea that eight people chuck out an idea.

734
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,650
They're all different.

735
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,690
And then we eventually morph into what we think is the best idea.

736
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,110
Um, and I think that's a great part of leadership groups.

737
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,409
And if you look at myself and Jack Viney, we're completely polar opposite people, but

738
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:07,869
we've led the club together for five years, created a really strong bond together.

739
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,449
And we have different point of views, um, which I think is a really strong nature to

740
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:12,590
have.

741
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,469
And now we have track has a different point of view.

742
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,110
He's a leader.

743
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,369
Um, Jake Lever, if you ever meet him is extremely black and white.

744
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,789
So there's like four very different point of views in our leadership group, um, that

745
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,630
creates hopefully the best, the best possible.

746
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,690
Answer had the great pleasure of sitting across from, from, uh, Jack Viney recently.

747
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,409
And, and, and I love the way you sum that up is you don't all have to come from the

748
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:36,369
same point of view, but ultimately as a group, you've got to find that common ground.

749
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,449
How combative can that get at times?

750
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,030
We all live by these four values of our football club.

751
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:47,090
So as, as is trust, respect, unity, excellence, majority of industries, workplaces would have

752
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,610
the similar four words.

753
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,230
Um, they're ours.

754
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,050
So we, or you can have a hundred ideas that all fit under.

755
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,809
Those four values.

756
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:00,530
So that's the good part, but it's not fully rogue because they're there.

757
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,449
We're, we're still coming from, we want Melbourne football club to be the best thing possible.

758
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:09,670
So I'm not sure if in your line of work to ask, if you come across many gen Zeds, but

759
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,690
it's an interesting lot of people, Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen Zed, like the 18 year olds that are

760
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,070
coming in.

761
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,250
Now, if you look at Hawthorne and how Hawthorne are playing their football currently, Jen

762
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,889
Zeds, you're almost do better as a, as a team.

763
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,409
If you let them run the club.

764
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,769
And let the 20 year olds take you forward, because they'll just take you on a journey.

765
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:32,710
They got no stresses or pressures or anxieties that, that, that Jen, why millennials have.

766
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,349
They're just loving life.

767
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,929
Um, and if you, if you let them take you somewhere, you'd be amazed how far you can go.

768
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,769
And that takes skill, doesn't it?

769
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:44,389
Because, you know, I've got a couple of them in my house, Max, that's what I'm getting

770
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:49,550
unfortunately, but it's very hard to relate to something that you just didn't grow up

771
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:49,949
with, isn't it?

772
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:53,769
And that's the art of bringing, especially in footy clubs, you're into your thirties,

773
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:54,630
you're a father of two.

774
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,670
You've got a very different set of way.

775
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,690
You were sort of parented probably, and now you've got these 18 year olds who just have

776
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,769
got no rules effectively.

777
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,269
Yeah.

778
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,210
Is that, as you said, if you, if you don't let them be themselves, you're in real trouble.

779
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:06,570
Yeah.

780
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,530
Like I, uh, slightly going away here, but another mentor of mine is Russell Howcroft.

781
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,170
Um, he was a board member when I first got there and we've, I've had spaghetti bolognese

782
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,909
at his house every Sunday for about 10 years.

783
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:18,309
It was great.

784
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:21,650
He inspires me because he's been at the head of advertising.

785
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,369
He's now, he's now in the media game.

786
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:24,469
Yeah.

787
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:24,510
Yeah.

788
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:24,530
Yeah.

789
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:24,550
Yeah.

790
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,570
Yeah.

791
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:24,590
Yeah.

792
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:24,610
Yeah.

793
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:24,630
Yeah.

794
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,989
He's the head of advertising for 40 years and advertising is probably the one thing

795
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,989
that's changed the most in 40 years.

796
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:36,809
And he was able to adapt and adapt and adapt and no have, don't have an ego amongst his

797
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:37,150
views.

798
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,070
Constantly have people come in and say, Oh no, billboards isn't the thing anymore.

799
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:47,329
Now it's a tick tock, but still be able to adapt and lead his industry into that space.

800
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,929
I think that's inspiring.

801
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:54,590
And that's sort of, um, the fear of change is something that a majority of people have.

802
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,210
But it's your ability to, um, deal with the fear of change.

803
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,329
And I, I, I'm scared of change.

804
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:05,329
Like I'm, I honestly am scared of change, but once that change happens, you feel yourself

805
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,090
moving with the, with the group and Gen Z challenges you with that.

806
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:11,329
When I first walked into the football club, it's speak when spoken to.

807
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,510
And even then don't speak.

808
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,389
Now it's like, if you're 32, don't speak.

809
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,170
The 19 year olds are running the club.

810
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,409
It's, it's gone the complete other direction.

811
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:24,530
Um, and being able to adapt is, um, something like from Russ that I find is really, really

812
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:24,989
inspiring.

813
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:25,789
I'm going to give a little plug.

814
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,150
I did an episode with Russell, one of the most intriguing and positive people you've

815
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,710
ever been around.

816
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,530
The energy and what Russell Howcroft walks into a room and hadn't thought of his career

817
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:34,989
that way.

818
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,050
Isn't it adapting the way he does is, is genius.

819
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,150
Max, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

820
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,309
Uh, well, good question.

821
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,530
In terms of football, Nathan Jones will forever be my skipper.

822
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,030
Like I, I call him skip.

823
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,250
Um, I'm sure you have someone you call skip.

824
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,389
Um, yeah, a lot of Melbourne boys in your era called David.

825
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:55,070
David needs skip.

826
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,550
Like he's, he's still, he's, he's still there skipper.

827
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,369
So Jones, you'll be forever my skipper.

828
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:02,889
I just think his way articulated these messages were really inspiring.

829
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:09,130
And also the relationship side to Nathan Jones, um, you work with him now he's, he's for someone

830
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,250
who's a Frankston Bogan, his ability to get a sentence out is phenomenal.

831
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:13,769
He's a, he's, he's a wordsmith.

832
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:19,730
We'd be sitting there for an hour going through a really strong values conversation and going

833
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,409
back and forward.

834
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:22,849
And then Nathan Jones would just say what he thinks an hour later.

835
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,389
And everyone's like.

836
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,889
That's correct.

837
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:26,090
Why don't you just speak at the start?

838
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,130
We wouldn't have been going for an hour.

839
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,150
Like you, he nails his points a lot.

840
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,070
And obviously the player he was.

841
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,389
So that's probably on the field.

842
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,230
Um, I would call him, um, away from football has always been my mom inspiring story came

843
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,650
over from New Zealand with $0, um, just had to get away from her family.

844
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:47,250
And then now she loves her family, but at the, at the time an 18 year old, um, Kiwi,

845
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,230
she needed to, um, just go see what, what the big land was about.

846
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,650
Um, and then went from hairdressing to.

847
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:57,530
All sorts to running their own successful cafe and then becoming a bit of a chain of

848
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,610
a cafe and starting a few.

849
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,829
I find that very inspiring.

850
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:05,070
And then the way she was able to put family first throughout that we've spoken about Jim.

851
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,469
So that would be the three in three different ways.

852
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,869
One is my leadership and one is my values.

853
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:11,769
And then one's my on-field sort of relationships.

854
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,230
When you look back, it's not surprising that you've got such a good handle on, uh, on the

855
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,269
way that you go about it.

856
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,030
It's when you bring those people together, what a, what a gift in life, really going

857
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,190
back to the final question, Max.

858
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,150
You're obsessed with.

859
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,690
This idea of what collaboration looks like.

860
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,929
And we feel like for the last 30, 40 years, it's been a lot about what I can get out of

861
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,170
life and what I can get out of my role, my work.

862
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,510
And now we're seeing this great opportunity to bring people together.

863
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,150
You've got so many interests.

864
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,670
Has there been one person you've got access to a lot of great people?

865
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:43,690
I'd love to collaborate with that person, whether it's your sporting life or your business

866
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,630
life or your family life.

867
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,769
Is there a name that springs to mind?

868
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,329
Yeah.

869
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:48,550
Well, I've got obviously different interests.

870
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:51,530
I've got a passion in sporting leadership.

871
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:52,789
If that's an industry.

872
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,869
Uh, I think it is.

873
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:58,110
There's a guy who works at our football club who's just finished up, but Jim, Jimmy Plunkett,

874
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,090
um, who initially worked with leading teams.

875
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:04,550
Um, and then he's been our, like, I forget the name.

876
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,630
They probably made it up, but it's like Pete manager of people, culture and growth at our

877
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,050
football club.

878
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,570
And I find that a really interesting space.

879
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:14,030
Um, and there's multiple people that excel in that.

880
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,469
Like a Ben Crow is famous for someone who excels in that space.

881
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:19,570
I feel like they'd be really cool conversations to have.

882
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,710
I'd love one day, um, to be able to.

883
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,130
Sit at like, imagine I pitched a team that goes to a world cups, like the wallabies,

884
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,090
the soccer roos, the hockey roos, anyone that goes to Olympics, just being able to go for

885
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,750
four or five weeks and be that leadership guy, um, that can help out culturally during

886
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,030
that.

887
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,730
I reckon that'd be a really cool experience.

888
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,469
So that's something that I'm inspiring to do.

889
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:45,210
Um, but certainly in hospital as well, there's, where do you, where do you start?

890
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,429
Like there's Julia Moose who dominates the cafe scene down here.

891
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:48,909
There's yourself.

892
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:50,550
Who's gotten successful pubs galore.

893
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,150
There's more Lucas group.

894
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,010
There's multiple people.

895
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,309
That you'd love to be able to have a chat with, um, to see where they're, to see where

896
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:56,730
they got to.

897
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,010
And

898
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,730
Max, I've been a massive admirer for a long period of time.

899
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:04,570
Um, Ruckman get a bag, bad rap, and you've changed the game.

900
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:09,010
I'm always, uh, on the lookout for someone who's, uh, I played a game at a level that,

901
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,210
uh, is at the top of the tree for the history of our game.

902
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,289
He's done it incredibly well.

903
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,130
I feel like there's much more left in the tank and the authentic way that you carry

904
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,449
yourself is, is inspiring.

905
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,309
Great to catch up with you and thanks for taking the time.

906
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:21,030
