00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:09,000
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is the incredible Meggie Palmer, a

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,720
former foreign correspondent and senior journalist who experienced her own issues with the gender

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,480
pay gap and gender leadership issues and has created Pep Talker, an amazing community of

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,679
60,000 passionate professional women who are desperate to make a difference in this space.

5
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,199
She talks in this chat about finding out from a male colleague how much less she was earning

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,039
than all the men in the newsroom and how this has sparked her passion in this space,

7
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,920
how moving away from the anger and the bitterness and choosing to take action has been

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,859
a really powerful part of her story. She also encourages male allies to speak up and work

9
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,740
towards solving this issue together. She's got great tips on how to negotiate better,

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,579
how to get a pay rise. She talks about narrowing in on your own zone of genius, which is

11
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,079
a great bit of wisdom to share. She's a remarkable person. I hope you

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,179
enjoy watching.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,859

friend Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper. A mattress like no other. It is the world's

22
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,340
best in bedding. I've been sleeping on mattresses provided by Temper for more than 15 years.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,900
It's a life-changing experience when you think about so much of your life is spent in bed

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,659
to invest in a Temper mattress. It's an investment that you will never regret.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,359
Meggie Palmer is a Walkley Award-winning filmmaker, a former foreign correspondent,

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,180
amongst others. After her own personal experience of discrimination and inequality as a journalist,

28
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,199
Meggie has made it her life mission to close the gender pay and leadership gap.

29
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,319
Meggie's response to the challenge was to create Pep Talk Her, which has grown into

Meggie's a sought-after international speaker and lectures at Columbia University on the

32
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,340
topic of gender equality and gender equality. Meggie's a sought-after international speaker and

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,719
topics of negotiation and confidence. Meg, it's great to catch up with you. I think we might

34
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,319
have crossed over at various stages in the media industry. Congratulations. It's incredible work

35
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,939
you're doing. Thanks so much for having me. Nice to know that we crossed paths back in our media

36
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,960
days. It's so exciting to have a chat with you today. I'm looking forward to it.

37
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,800
It's incredible work that you're doing in this space. Can we start by sharing

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
your personal experience with battling with the gender pay gap?

39
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,180
Yes. Possibly something that some of your listeners may be able to relate to.

40
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,520
Basically, at one point in my career, I found out actually quite by accident,

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,219
thanks to a male ally who slipped me some intel, that actually my pay and conditions,

42
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,879
my contract and the pay that I was getting was quite different to the guys in the newsroom who

43
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,039
I sat next to. I just thought it was a mistake. I was like, oh, well, we'll just fix it. That's

44
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,340
cool. No dramas, whatever. I had a convo. Let's just say it didn't go well, Luke. It wasn't well

45
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,099
received. Quote, unquote, they told me, this is no joke. They said, Meggie,

46
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:44,020
if you don't like it, why don't you quit or take us to court? I was kind of like, are you serious?

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,180
Because I was sort of raised like if you see something, say something. To me, things being

48
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,979
equal is very important. It goes to the core of what I think is fair in life. It's just part of

49
00:03:54,979 --> 00:04:00,080
who I am from when I was a kid getting in trouble when actually my brother did the wrong thing. I

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,199
still remember viscerally being annoyed by that. That's kind of stayed with me my whole life.

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,659
Compelled that I had to do something because I knew they wanted me to just kind of like walk

52
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:15,099
away quietly. But I was like, well, I really back myself. I know I'm a great journo. I know I'll get

53
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,079
another job. What if I was pregnant or what if I was the primary breadwinner or what if I didn't

54
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,740
have savings? Like what if it happened to someone in that situation? They wouldn't be able to take

55
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,519
on that fight. And so anyway, long story short, yeah, I kind of stepped up and took on that

56
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,060
challenge, I guess. And then, you know, fast forward now, I'm based in New York,

57
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,540
and my business is all about closing that inequality gap in terms of pay and leadership as

58
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,519
well. Yeah, which is an amazing response, isn't it? And you think of the unfairness of that and

59
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:55,040
having experienced the industry and been around it at the same time, I'd hate to say that I'm not

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,160
surprised because passionate about what good leadership looks like me. And I think media

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,160
industry has been right at the bottom rung of general leadership in lots of areas.

62
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,139
Media is great at telling stories about what other people need to do well, but not so good

63
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,800
I've found at putting the mirror up to their own culture at times. But a lot of people

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,079
just move, most of us move on and say, okay, that's too big a fight to have. But you've decided

65
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:27,000
to turn it into an amazing project. Pep, talk her, tell us about how you've responded to it and

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,639
how that's worked for you. Well, you know, I think as leaders and, you know, even as members

67
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,139
of society, we always have a choice. You know, when stuff happens to us,

68
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,199
or when stuff happens to other people, there's always two choices. You can look the other way

69
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,220
and you can be like, oh, it's not my fight. It's not my battle. Or you can do something about it.

70
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,680
And, you know, I was really bitter. I was really angry. And really on reflection, it's in some

71
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,779
ways, it's a first world problem. Like I'm a middle-class white identifying woman. And the

72
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,420
first time really that I'd experienced inequality was, you know, in my mid career. And I think now

73
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,800
about all my friends of color, you know, my friends who identify as gay, like the discrimination

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,980
they've actually experienced.

75
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,660
So much earlier in their lives compared to what I went through, really, you know, mine was nothing.

76
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,199
And so I think actually putting into perspective is very important. And again, just reframing it,

77
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,800
I can get angry and stay bitter, or I can try and change it. And I think like, to me, that's a call

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
to action that all of us can take on when we see stuff that's wrong, when we see folks being racist,

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,019
when we see something happening in the workplace to someone else, that's not fair, that's not right.

80
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,819
We can turn away from it, or we can say something, whether we say something to that person and

81
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,740
support them afterwards, or whether we find a time and a place to actually call that leader out.

82
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,199
You know, it really depends on how comfortable you feel and how much power you feel like you

83
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,600
have internally. But I think we don't talk about that enough, you know, and I really want to talk

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,500
about that more. And so it was kind of an accident, really, like pep talker was, was just something

85
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,800
that I started to do after I had that, that situation, friends started asking me for advice

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,199
when they got sacked when they were on maternity leave, or, you know, you know, they had to take

87
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,800
days off for their kids who were sick.

88
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,620
And then all of a sudden, they got overlooked for promotion. So people would just ask me for

89
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,459
advice, because they knew what I'd been through. And then I had their friends, cousins, sister

90
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,199
calling me and then all these people and I was like, Oh, hang on. So this is like a bit of a

91
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,180
thing. I was pretty naive, honestly, to the fact that in the Western world, the gender pay gap is

92
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,980
somewhere between 15 and 20%, which is no joke. But it's even worse when you look at what that

93
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,939
means for retirement, right. And so in terms of superannuation and pension funds, there's a

94
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,300
massive gap there, you know, more than 40%.

95
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:51,040
And so the reason I care about this is because when women have money, we have choice, you know,

96
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,300
it gives us choice, it gives us options, and it gives us freedom. So that's why I'm really

97
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,259
passionate about it. Yeah. Yeah, congratulations. It's an amazing contribution you're making. I

98
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:05,720
love all great ideas come out of this desire to help, you know, and I think that's where the best

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:05,800
thing comes out of. Yeah.

100
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:12,740
is it not someone sitting around or how do I, you know, make more money? Effectively, it's you've

101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,639
solved, starting to solve a problem. You've got a huge community behind you. Why is it do you think

102
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,120
women generally, as a rule, find it harder to ask for a pay rise than men do?

103
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,680
So it honestly comes back to how we're socialized, right? So if you think back to when you were

104
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,699
growing up, and I don't know, do you have siblings, Luke?

105
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,139
I'm one of four. Yeah, I've got two sisters and an older brother.

106
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:35,779
Okay.

107
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,639
Okay, cool. And so for you, and maybe for anyone listening today, like just reflect on when you

108
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,460
were growing up, right? So I'm one of three, I'm the oldest, got a younger brother and a younger

109
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,019
sister. And my parents were pretty good. They were pretty aware of, you know, trying to make us all

110
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,480
be treated equally and stuff like that. But even so, there were certain things that were a little

111
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,720
bit different, you know, in terms of how we were treated. Like when we had our grandparents coming

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,179
over, my sister and I really had to kind of help make the house look good and the table be nice

113
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,940
and, you know, entertain people as they came in and welcome them and make sure they had a drink.

114
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,799
Whereas my brother would kind of be breaking down and say, you know, I'm not going to do this. I'm

115
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,840
dancing on the front lawn and just kind of like doing his thing. And so from a young age, there's

116
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,759
like little tiny triggers that actually means that we're socialized to behave a little bit

117
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,919
differently. And typically what we see is that women are socialized from a young age to kind of

118
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,840
keep the peace, make everyone feel comfortable, not want to rock the boat. And so then you can

119
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,100
see how that kind of translates into the professional world where having a conversation

120
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,500
about money is not always something that we're comfortable doing because we're fearful that we

121
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,059
won't be liked or that we'll get fired or that our boss will frankly get pissed off that we dared

122
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:42,600
to ask the question, right? Whereas often we see little boys are kind of socialized from a younger

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,480
age to be open about talking about money, to talk about investing. They grow up, you know,

124
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,399
expecting that they should earn money and hopefully good money, you know, and the expectations are a

125
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,139
little different. And actually, Luke, there's a super interesting study. It's actually been done

126
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:02,720
in various ways in three different countries that shows that little girls get less pocket money

127
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,639
than little boys, right? And it's not because parents are bad people. It's just because there's

128
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,080
a perception that like, for example, collecting the firewood or helping in the garden is a tougher

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,360
task, for example, than perhaps preparing a meal or helping with the laundry. And so again, from

130
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,559
a really young age, there's these kind of really tiny, subtle clues that tell us that we're

131
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,039
different, right? And so that's kind of part of the reason that it parlays into the professional

132
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,779
world as well. And one of the other pieces of research that's super interesting is that women

133
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,059
are actually asking.

134
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,679
For more money. They are actually negotiating for their pay, but they're treated differently

135
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,980
and they don't get those pay increases at the same rate. And researchers hypothesize that that's

136
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,120
because of unconscious bias and discrimination.

137
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,580
And Meggie, I think for all of us males who've, you know, and I reflect a lot more these days of

138
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:57,940
going to a boys' school, a boys' boarding school, playing AFL football in a male environment. But I

139
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,899
always think of, you know, I've got an 18-year-old daughter and I think of my sisters and

140
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,480
it doesn't take a lot to be a male. And I think of my sisters and it doesn't take a lot to be a

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,279
male. And so I think it's important to get some perspective and some empathy and some passion

142
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,600
when you actually think how I would react if someone treated my 18-year-old daughter that way,

143
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,440
it would be a pretty short conversation, Meggie. And I think that's a really, for me, a really

144
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,279
profound world because you don't know what you don't know until someone like you articulates it

145
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,740
in that way. But hopefully we can play a role because we do genuinely care. We do genuinely

146
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,100
want equality in the same way, but perhaps it's just been not our lived experience. And that takes

147
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,480
some time.

148
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Do you find you're getting men, you know, perhaps like me that are genuinely interested in care or

149
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,679
are you finding there's a bracket of men that are scared and don't want it to change?

150
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,360
Look, I mean, I think we're all a product of our upbringing, right? And we, all of us listening

151
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,659
today, regardless of how we identify gender-wise, we all have bias, right? Because of what we saw

152
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:57,659
growing up and we're a product of our parents who are a product of their parents. And so we only

153
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,159
know what we know from what is role-modeled to us, to your point, right? And so someone said to me

154
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:09,399
once, Luke, you know, it takes a long time to turn a big ship. And I think about that a lot when I

155
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,419
think about feminism and equality, and it kind of pisses me off that we're still having this

156
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:19,100
conversation. And yet I reflect on the fact that, you know, up until, I don't know, I think it was

157
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,240
only like 40 years ago, women needed their husband's signature to get a credit card in

158
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,419
Australia. So progress is happening. Obviously I wish I could click my fingers and it would change

159
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,120
tomorrow, but I'm also a realist. Like, you know, the UN is saying that it's going to take one

160
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,980
hundred to two hundred years to close the gap. And so again, I wish it was happening sooner,

161
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,080
but I think it's going to take generational change. And I think, you know, our generation,

162
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,700
the next generation, they do have very different views, which is a great thing. And so we're going

163
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
to see change happen at a faster and faster rate, which is awesome. But yeah, I just, I try and

164
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,000
reflect on the fact that all of us today are a product of the folks who've protested and advocated

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,700
for change on so many issues in the past. And so that kind of gives me hope going forward as well.

166
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,000
Me, I mentioned my sort of perspective and upbringing, but in this latter part of my

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,879
working life and in the leadership business that we run and being surrounded by so many more

168
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,460
brilliant females. And I wrote down in preparation for this, the traits that I saw, I sit on a board

169
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,899
of my old football club as well, which is full of unbelievable women. I just, it's like the women

170
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,080
are kinder, they're more efficient, seriously less ego, incredible attention to detail, conscientious,

171
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,740
more empathy.

172
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,019
I look at all the traits that naturally are feminine traits in lots of ways. And I'm not

173
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,440
sure if that's even the right language, but to me, it seems almost bizarre as I reflect to,

174
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,620
it's taken me so long and others to understand just how much better women are than men in so

175
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,519
many areas and how much more that should be rewarded and how much more efficient and better

176
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,179
it is. I mean, is that something that you think, you know, if you're talking about wanting to

177
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,740
negotiate a part, they're the traits that you should pay someone more on,

178
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,899
the things that I just said, it sort of makes sense at one level, doesn't it?

179
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,159
Yeah. I mean, we all bring different things to the table, you know, and when I think about this

180
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,600
issue of equality, you know, I get a lot of haters, Luke, online of people who are like,

181
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,720
oh, pep talker, that's BS, like it's fake news, blah, blah, blah. And the thing is like, it is,

182
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,700
to me, it's a moral and ethical issue, of course, to treat people fairly. But honestly,

183
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,620
even putting that to one side, if you're a capitalist, you should care about this,

184
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:31,620
right? If you own shares, if you have a superannuation account, you should be interested

185
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,899
and you should care that companies take this seriously. Because when companies take this

186
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,179
seriously, you know, you make more money, you're going to get higher dividends, you're going to get

187
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,279
a faster growth of your share portfolio, because studies have proven that when there are diverse

188
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,120
voices at the table, diversity across all facets. And so you actually don't want a company led

189
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,840
entirely by women either, by the way, we want all perspectives, because then problem solving is

190
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,220
better. You're able to sort of see those challenges coming around the corner a lot faster when you hear

191
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,700
those different diverse perspectives. So yeah, I mean, I just, I'm,

192
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,059
it's also important, I think, for folks like you to kind of share your experience. I love hearing

193
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,980
that. Certainly, anecdotally, we see that as well. But I think it's very important for allies to talk

194
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,419
about this openly, because I can say it. But then it's also easy for people to roll their eyes at me

195
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,000
and be like, well, you would say that you're a woman and you talk about this all the time. So I

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,059
think it's awesome for everyone listening to say, well, actually, what role can I play? Like, what

197
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,220
could I do this week? And here's a little challenge, like, truly, what can you do this week

198
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,100
to be an ally? And maybe that's just the way it works.

199
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,460
Sending an email to someone on the intern team to say, hey, if you ever have any questions,

200
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,919
reach out to me. Maybe that's just raising something with a leader to say, hey, how come

201
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,419
we haven't considered so-and-so for this promotion? Like, whatever it is, how can you use your power

202
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:51,620
and privilege to help create change? Because we can't just expect it always to come from the top

203
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,379
and from the execs. You know, I think it has to be push and pull. It has to come from the grassroots

204
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,659
too, so that we can sort of, you know, change the hearts and minds as well a little bit.

205
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah, remarkable. As you said,

206
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,919
and I can see the frustration that we're still having these conversations. It seems,

207
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,960
you know, obvious at so many levels. Can you just, how does Pep Talker work? You've created an app and

208
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,379
an incredible community behind you. What does someone do when they sign up to Pep Talker?

209
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,799
Yeah, so when I was thinking about it, as I said, I was having all these folks calling me

210
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,080
and asking me for advice on discrimination, on negotiating pay, on having the confidence to

211
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,100
apply for promotions. And I actually just couldn't keep up. I was a full-time journalist at the

212
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,000
time. I couldn't keep up with the calls. And I was doing a lot of stories actually as a reporter

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,820
then on tech and startups and how you could use technology and AI to kind of scale things. So

214
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:49,179
then I was like, well, could you scale coaching people on this stuff? And so I did an accelerator

215
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,379
and through that, I met a friend of mine, Alex, who's awesome, who's a product manager. And so

216
00:16:54,379 --> 00:17:00,700
I had no idea what I was doing. I'm not a coder. I still can't code, but I know how to ask questions

217
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,080
and I know how to collaborate.

218
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,579
with people. And Alex really helped me on that journey. And so we mapped out what we wanted the

219
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,299
app to look like. He helped me find someone to build it. Actually, we were just like a couple

220
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,759
of weeks ago featured in the Google Play Store. Apple's done a big feature on us. They called me

221
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,519
and they were like, can you fly to San Francisco for a shoot for the Apple homepage? And I thought

222
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,799
it was, I thought I was being punked or pranked. And I hung up. I was like, lol. And I hung up.

223
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,960
And then they called me back and they were like, why did you hang up? So it's an app and it's kind

224
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,759
of like Luke.

225
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,200
It's kind of like a Fitbit, except instead of tracking your steps and your exercise,

226
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:41,160
it tracks your successes. It tracks your work wins. And I know that you know this as well

227
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,079
through the leadership work that you do, like our brains, unfortunately, are hardwired for

228
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,559
negativity, right? And so the app is kind of based on the premise of the nudge theory of

229
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,920
psychology of like, if we can make incremental tiny bit by bit change day by day, week by week,

230
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,500
in terms of how we view ourselves and our success at work, then if we can do that incrementally

231
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,079
every week, then we're going to be able to do a lot of things. And so I think it's kind of

232
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,980
like, well, we're going to be able to do that incrementally every week, a couple of months,

233
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,380
maybe for a year. That's actually really going to shift our perception of ourself and our value.

234
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,180
And then you can literally like use all the wins that you've tracked in the app.

235
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,119
You can print it out, you can PDF it, whatever. And you can like physically take that into your

236
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:22,380
conversation as notes, as reflection, as data points to say to your boss, listen, you know,

237
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,980
website clicks are up 22% year on year. The CFO sent me this note to say thank you for this

238
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,039
accounting practice that I changed. You know, I hired these three folks, which meant it's

239
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,940
saved the company $60,000 in recruiting costs. Whatever the KPI is that you've achieved,

240
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,259
you've then got it into one place. So firstly, you're going to feel more confident negotiating.

241
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,220
And also there's meat on the bone. You're making it easier for your boss and for the

242
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,019
leadership team to say yes, to say yes to your promotion or your pay increase request.

243
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,559
And is that what you described then in your mind, the art of negotiating well,

244
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,900
to come in with data and come in with a preparation to sort of sit down with a conversation and

245
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,440
genuinely,

246
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,940
pitch yourself worth, you know, what tone do you take with that? How would you describe the best

247
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,440
way to, you know, increase your own worth and negotiate better pay? Yeah, I mean, having data

248
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,599
and preparation is for sure one of the steps that we talk about a lot. So the app is kind of like,

249
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,119
it's free, by the way, we, you know, we make the app free. It's part of our impact work. We want

250
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,420
everyone to use it. It's on all of the app stores, people can download it. It's just called Pep Talk

251
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,359
Her. And really, that's one step in the process. It's definitely going to help you if you want to

252
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,420
get bananas off your chest. It's definitely going to help you if you want to get bananas off your

253
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,460
chest. And really, that's one step in the process. It's definitely going to help you if you want to

254
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,500
get bananas off your chest. And really, that's one step in the process. It's definitely going to

255
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:31,519
help you if you want to get bananas off your chest. And really, that's one step in the process. It's

256
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,519
results like we've seen some of our clients, like, you know, I had a text today from someone who's

257
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,259
just got a new job, and it's $45,000 more. Last year, one of our clients in Sydney, she's now

258
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,559
earning $108,000 more, because she went through one of our programs. And so she's putting in a

259
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,019
pool for her kids. So it's kind of like, it's, it's, it's a big deal, right? Like, it makes a

260
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:55,299
significant difference for folks' lives. Yeah. So when you think about negotiation, there's a bunch

261
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,599
of different steps. But the first foundational step is firstly, to understand your worth.

262
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,779
And the easiest way to do that is to track those successes yourself. And then the other thing you

263
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,759
can do is like, take a straw poll, like, text your best mate. Like, we can do that now, if you want,

264
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:13,380
everyone can grab out their cell phone, not if you're driving and listening. But otherwise,

265
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,500
you can get out your mobile, and just text your best mate, or text your BFF at work, or maybe one

266
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,680
of your old bosses who you're still in touch with, and just say, Hey, I'm listening to Luke's podcast.

267
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,799
And they've kind of asked us to do this random thing,

268
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,059
to text a friend. And I just want you to say, Hey, what would you say my best quality is?

269
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,059
And that's it. That's the text. What would you say is my best quality? And like, you know,

270
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:38,059
let's see what people write back. And make sure if you hear back, like tag Luke and I on social

271
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,279
media and let us know, because sometimes we're so in our own head. And we think, Oh, my gosh,

272
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,579
I put a spelling mistake in that email, or I stuffed up that client, or, you know, what,

273
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,680
maybe you've been made redundant lately, like, there's a lot of challenges that are going on

274
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,619
for people. But you forget that there's so many awesome things that you've done. There's so many

275
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,740
ways you've impacted folks around you. And so get that external feedback, never be afraid to ask

276
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,779
people who you love, trust and respect for their thoughts about you. Because you might be very

277
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,599
surprised about what they say. And it also Luke might help you kind of better identify your zone

278
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,799
of genius so that then you can kind of lean into that in the workplace, because then you'll be

279
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,500
happier, work will become a lot easier for you. So yeah, there's so many positive ramifications

280
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,140
of doing that. I love it. It's a great idea, Maggie, coming from the sporting world, you know,

281
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,859
the historical thing was to spend so much time on what you couldn't do. Oh, he's not a great kick,

282
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:36,420
or he can't reinforcing all of the negative as opposed to the great coaches, work out what you're

283
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,160
brilliant at. And then the research, as you said, you know, if you focus on those things and improve

284
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,380
that, the results automatically are much better than the reinforced negative. And so encourage

285
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,839
everyone to do it. It's a it's a powerful thing. And we're not great, particularly in Australia,

286
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,720
we're not great at celebrating what we're good at. We're very uncomfortable sitting,

287
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,900
in that space, you want to make someone uncomfortable in our part of the world,

288
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,660
and the Americans are a bit better at it. But tell them what you like about them, tell them

289
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,619
that exercise, and you watch people squirm. It's a fascinating part of our psyche. Hey,

290
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,720
it's incredible work that you're doing. I love that it was born out of your own

291
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,240
sense of injustice. And I can hear your values come through so strongly. And I'm fascinated by

292
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,059
this. We think that success leaves clues, Maggie, and that in leadership, there are some real

293
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,779
patterns that we've identified and love to talk about, starting with self-leadership,

294
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,720
as a term that we feel like to lead others, like you're doing, you have to have an understanding

295
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,559
of your own sense of self-leadership. What does that mean to you?

296
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,019
Well, like, candidly, Luke, like, for me, when I left journalism, when I had a side

297
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,640
hustle, I had another business that was a side hustle that I leant into when I left

298
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,279
journalism while I figured out how to make Pet Talk Her a business before we became a

299
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,799
big consultancy. And, you know, I honestly spent, I reckon, six to 12 months just figuring

300
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,740
out what I was good at, and also what I was bad at.

301
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,119
Because there's a lot of things that I'm bad at. And so I did a heap of coaching, like

302
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,640
a heap of self-reflection. I was just like, I actually just need to figure out, like,

303
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,539
not who am I? I kind of knew that. But like, what's going on here? Like, what should I

304
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,940
be doing? What do I actually just need to cut out? Because it's not my zone of genius.

305
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:14,559
And so I did a heap of coaching. I'm obsessed with Gallup Strength Finders. That's been

306
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,839
really instrumental for me to understand that I am different and unique, and that's okay.

307
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,640
Because I think, you know, one of my Gallup strengths, for anyone who's listening who

308
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
knows about Gallup Strength Finders, it basically says that we're all made up of, I think it's

309
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,680
like 30 or 35 different strengths, right? And they kind of plot you on this chart, and

310
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,240
this is your top, and this is your bottom, or whatever. And they focus on your top five.

311
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:41,859
And a lot of my friends, Luke, used to call me Cyclone Palmer in a very, like, a kind

312
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:45,640
way. But sometimes I used to, I knew they loved me, and I knew it was nice, but I was

313
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,740
kind of like, like a little bit offended. I was like, what does that even mean? Because

314
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:54,359
I didn't understand. I was just like, well, I didn't realize that actually I have Activator,

315
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,200
as one of my strengths, which means that I love to start projects, I have lots of ideas,

316
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,220
I'm very good at, like, getting things done quickly, and just being like, okay, we'll

317
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,019
do this, and then we'll book a trip to Jamaica, and then these people will come, and it's

318
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,420
just done. And people are like, what just happened? But I'm like, yeah, but don't you

319
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,700
do that? And I didn't realize that, no, not everyone does do that. And I realized that

320
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,319
some of the qualities that I loved in my friends was because I really, that was their strength,

321
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,400
and I didn't have that, and so I so admired it in them. So for me, like, I really think

322
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,839
that, like, really, and I'm really candid with my team as well. I'm like, listen, I'm

323
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,460
really good at this.

324
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,420
And I'm sadly really bad at that, but just, like, full disclosure, this is what you're

325
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,039
getting into working with me, you know?

326
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,960
Yeah, and we see that again, Miggy, is a great strength, that no one's got every skill in

327
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,420
the book, and that's why you bring people around. But the hard part for most people

328
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,460
is actually self-reflecting to understand that they do need help in that area, and then

329
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,279
getting great people around them to support in those areas. That's the genius that we

330
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,400
see in these conversations. So I'm not surprised that you identified that, and the

331
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,440
support.

332
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,980
Self-reflection part, too, isn't it, as you said, to understand those strengths and go

333
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,079
after them. We really see people who are having consistent success really conscious about

334
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,559
how they positively impact others in their environment, and your work is having a huge

335
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,980
impact. How have you gone about that impact on people on a daily basis?

336
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:19,480
I think, you know, I think when I was thinking about this podcast interview and that conversation,

337
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,039
I think one of the other things that I wanted to share with your listeners is that I think,

338
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,339
like, sometimes I drop the ball.

339
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,160
And I think sometimes I'm not a great leader, honestly. Like, I'm a bit embarrassed to say

340
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,740
that out loud, but I think it's important to share that, too, because I think so often

341
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,019
we listen to podcasts and we, you know, I do it anyway. I sort of deify these people.

342
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:40,220
I'm like, wow, that's amazing. And like, oh, my gosh, I'm not like that. And how did they get

343
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,400
that done? And I just want to kind of candidly share that I think I've sometimes let my team

344
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,740
down, for sure. Definitely when I was a journalist. And even now, I think there's so much that I could

345
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,900
do to improve every day. And actually, COVID was really interesting for me because

346
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,180
I was working from home. And so was my partner, Ryan. And he said to me one day,

347
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,900
because he could probably hear a lot of my chats or whatever. He's like, you know,

348
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,940
you're a micromanager, right? And I was like, what? No, I'm an amazing leader and I'm a fabulous

349
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,299
manager. What? Like, I just didn't want to hear it. I was like, oh, you're so annoying. Like,

350
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,740
what would you know? Like, don't eavesdrop. I just like really deflected it. And actually,

351
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,079
I had to think about it. I was like, oh. So what I've realized, Luke, is that I think I'm a great

352
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,980
manager, but I'm actually not a great manager. And I think the two things are quite different.

353
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,039
So I, you know, I like to think that I am very good at inspiring the vision and kind of getting

354
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:40,160
people excited about the capacity to change, about the capacity to influence their career trajectory

355
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,220
when we're working with, you know, Fortune 500 clients and ASX businesses, you know,

356
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,259
like Westpac and Salesforce and PwC. Like, I love the change that we create for them

357
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:54,339
at the mid to senior leadership roles. And I think I'm good at that. But in terms of

358
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,200
managing my specific team, I've actually just the last couple of weeks hired someone.

359
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:03,660
And really, she's going to take on 90% of that work for me, because I was just letting my team

360
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,940
down. And I was worried that I was going to start to lose some of my integral team members. And

361
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,319
yeah, so I just wanted to share that because I'm kind of embarrassed by some of the mistakes that

362
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,180
I've made along the way. But, you know, I like the concept that everything is figureoutable

363
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,799
and that actually no one else knows what they're doing either. And everyone else is also making

364
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,180
sure there's other people listening who've also made mistakes and, you know, maybe feel

365
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,980
embarrassed by that. But I just wanted to share that so that other people know that they're

366
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,279
certainly not alone in that. It's 100% true. And I appreciate you doing that,

367
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,200
Meggie, isn't it? Because often it's the highlights for you, isn't it? We sit down and say,

368
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:42,599
well, you've got this great community. And for all of us, you know, we're really passionate,

369
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,700
Meggie, about a leader as a business that started eight years ago, founded with my great friend,

370
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,839
Matt Wadowitz. And he's currently in New York today with you. He's been over at the Green Bay

371
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,420
Packers and he's doing all the work. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a

372
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,759
incredible thing. And we sort of sit back sometimes and go, but really at the same time,

373
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,440
making it up completely and making huge mistakes as you go and trying to figure it out, trying to

374
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,420
get better. You know, sometimes you need to apologize to your team because you just didn't

375
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:16,779
know and you let them down. But I think to share that is really what we love because that is how

376
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:22,500
you get better. If you're self-reflective and curious to get better, I think that's just part

377
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,420
of how you get anywhere, isn't it? So, yeah.

378
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,839
I think you summed that up incredibly well. It's an amazing vision that you've got,

379
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,279
isn't it? Closing the gender and leadership, gender pay and leadership gap. It's a huge

380
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,440
vision. We see leaders are really conscious about how they create those visions and share them.

381
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,279
How have you gone about that?

382
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,140
I do. So, I try and do this thing where every year I take two days and I kind of rent an Airbnb in

383
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,279
the middle of nowhere on my own. And I just take like lots of massive notepads and texters and I

384
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,400
just kind of like go through this weird...

385
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,940
I basically like don't... I just like put ideas on the blackboard and on the whiteboard and I write

386
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,740
and I post it and I just kind of brainstorm all of these different things. And early on in my

387
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,099
business, I created this kind of like internal manifesto kind of thing that really set out how

388
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:13,619
what our vision is to close that pay gap. The fact that we want to impact 100,000 women by 2025.

389
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,859
The fact that we have a wishlist of our 10 top corporate clients that we want to be working

390
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:23,640
with over the next 12 months and just putting that out there. And then my team joined me

391
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,019
after about two days of me going a bit like all over the place. And then they kind of helped me

392
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:31,599
bring it into line and this is a terrible idea or we could do this or add this on instead.

393
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:35,220
So, I try and share that with them and then also making it very clear about

394
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,319
what are the values and the behaviors that I expect from each of them in terms of how they

395
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,279
live that bigger picture vision. So, there's certain language that we don't use in emails.

396
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:47,019
There's certain phrasing that we do use because we want to try and infuse

397
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:53,700
our vision and our practice into emailing back and forth. Even little things like that.

398
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,000
So, yeah. I mean, again, I probably could do a better job of doing that on a daily basis. But

399
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,160
one of the other things that I've been really focused on lately is, and this is a coach helped

400
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,240
me with this, is giving positive feedback to my team every week. Because I'm very good at when we

401
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,079
let people down or when we don't achieve the goals, we're very good at talking about that.

402
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,039
But we sometimes forget actually to live our values and stop and reflect about those wins.

403
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,920
So, now that's part of our team meeting. It's part of my to-do list every week that I actually

404
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,480
reflect and send a Slack message to everyone about something that I'm really grateful for them for,

405
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,559
something that they've contributed. Because again, I want to build that muscle for them,

406
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:36,559
that they're valued, that they're contributing, that they're helping support the 60,000 women

407
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,460
that we work with around the world. They're helping to shift the percentage of leadership

408
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,640
in senior roles for our corporate clients. So, I want to remind them of that. Because as you know,

409
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,400
Luke, one of the challenges of running a business is the impact work and the execution is one thing,

410
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:01,240
but having a team to work alongside you and to stay alongside you is really important. And one of

411
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,480
the things I'm most proud of is my assistant. I was telling you before we started recording,

412
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:09,380
she's on her second maternity leave from the business now, which is awesome for her and

413
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,839
terrible for my calendar. But she's been with me for so long now and I'm hoping that she's

414
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,680
going to stay with me for a lot longer. But it's hard to retain top talent. And yeah,

415
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,920
so we try and do what we can in little ways.

416
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,000
Someone said something profound to me the other day. You don't actually build a great business,

417
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:34,900
you hire and collaborate with great people and they build a great business. And never a truer

418
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:42,460
word has been spoken. And I also really resonate with Stacey Morlang, who's great to have been on

419
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,819
this podcast, works with us now. And she uses the term, catch them being good is the way she

420
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:52,779
coaches junior sport. And it's so true that free hits there all the time, isn't it? Just in an

421
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:58,579
email to respond and just give that extra little bit of positivity in your world. It's something

422
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:02,880
that's sitting there. It's an obvious thing to do, but it's so powerful when people do it. And

423
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,599
you know yourself, when someone takes the time to send you a little message, it's an incredibly

424
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,420
powerful thing to do. Curiosity is a word we talk about a lot in our space. And we see ladies are

425
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,960
really curious in every area. And through that, that's how they constantly want to get better.

426
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,700
Is curiosity something that resonates with you?

427
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,619
Yeah. I mean, I can only...

428
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:26,140
I can only imagine my parents when I was growing up. I was probably that kid that was like,

429
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,500
but why? But why? But why? It's probably why I became a journalist because I'm so interested

430
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,359
in people's stories and understanding. And I want to know the nuance and I want to get deeper. And I

431
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,519
really want to know the heart of people because I feel like if you can understand people and not

432
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,099
just the surface level, like beneath the iceberg, truly what are folks' stories.

433
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,500
And then you can kind of understand people. You can empathize with them when they're cruel or

434
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,519
when they do something wrong. You can understand why they're doing that because of...

435
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:57,140
their story and what they've been through. So I am very curious specifically about people.

436
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:05,380
That's what really motivates me every day. And it's funny. Sometimes even as a journalist,

437
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,799
I was asking hundreds of questions a day and now I still ask questions. But even with our students,

438
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,160
as the business has grown, I used to know all of my students like I would know their entire

439
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,079
backstory. And now I still know them relatively well, but it's harder to know as many people at

440
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,579
such a deep level. But recently, one of them...

441
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:29,880
shared something which piqued my curiosity to ask her more information. And I knew that when

442
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,319
she joined our program, she was in a bad place. She was living in a remote part of Australia

443
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:41,440
in a bad relationship and she wasn't earning a lot of money. And then fast forward maybe a month or

444
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,220
two months after the program, she landed a six-figure job, which blew her away. But more

445
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,900
importantly than that, Luke, she was able to leave that relationship. And as a result of that leave,

446
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:51,920
that geographic location, she was able to leave that relationship. And as a result of that leave,

447
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,759
that geographic location, she was able to leave that relationship. And as a result of that leave,

448
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:56,980
which she was finding very isolating. And I was curious, I said to her, I was like,

449
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:02,380
what do you think it was that motivated you to be able to make that change? Was it just the money,

450
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,559
the extra salary? And she said to me, Luke, she was like, yeah, it was that, but it was also

451
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,659
understanding that I wasn't the only one going through that. And the community that she'd found

452
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,860
in the pep talker community, and that also gave her the courage, I suppose, to connect with other

453
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:22,579
women. Understanding that people aren't alone, I think is so important. And you and I both worked

454
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:22,760
in the middle of the world, and I think it's so important to be able to connect with other women

455
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,079
a lot of that means meeting a lot of people and getting comfortable doing that. And I think I

456
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,579
often forget that it's very hard for a lot of people to do that. And when we can create moments

457
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,119
for people to be curious with each other and to connect with each other at a deeper level,

458
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,199
that's really powerful. And you never know what the multiplier effect of that could be,

459
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,000
not just for their relationships and their connection, but potentially for their lives as

460
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,559
well. Yeah, another great point. And loneliness is a real thing. And again, I was reading a

461
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,639
study, I think the other day that, you know, historically, if you went back sort of 50 or 60

462
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:03,880
years, most people would be able to say there's three or four people that genuinely trusted

463
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,820
personal confidence that are there for them in their life. And that was just historically because

464
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,659
people did connect in that way. And it was more of a village. But, you know, the advent of social

465
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:22,360
media at one level, we've got more friends online. But in America, most people have got not one

466
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,099
person that they would say is the trusted, confident that they could go to personally in

467
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:34,219
that situation. It's what a shift that is and how sad it is and how lonely people are out there.

468
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:38,679
We're surrounded by more people, but lonelier than ever. And so again, I'm not surprised your

469
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:43,360
community is having that effect on lots of people in a profound way. Congratulations on

470
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,539
what you're doing that communicating with clarity. I'm sure as your spaces evolve that

471
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,179
you mentioned it earlier, that opportunity to communicate consistently,

472
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,599
how have you gone about it? You know, I mean, I think one of the advantages of having,

473
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,719
you know, sometimes you sort of think maybe it was imposter syndrome for me being a journalist

474
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,119
and then starting a business. And I don't know if you had this as well, transitioning from sport

475
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,500
and media into business. It's sometimes you think, oh, I need an MBA or I should have been in finance

476
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,960
to start a business. And actually, one of the great things is, is that business, whether you're

477
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,500
in finance, insurance, consulting like we are, or if you're a social media influencer, it's really

478
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,139
about people and relationships. That's at the core of what any business is.

479
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,219
So if anyone's listening and has a bit of a kernel of an idea, like I really encourage you to go for

480
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,880
it and reach out to folks around you who've done that, who can help support you and give you that

481
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,099
advice. So one of the benefits that I've found, you know, the curiosity piece is valuable in

482
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:40,059
business, Luke, because you get to understand your clients better and understand their needs

483
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:45,260
and their pain points and how you can help them with that. But also understanding how to leverage

484
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:52,239
media as well and being able to, when, you know, Apple rings you to feature you on their news story

485
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,340
and they're like, oh, I'm going to do this. And you're like, oh, I'm going to do this. And you're

486
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,380
like, oh, I'm going to do this. And you're like, oh, I'm going to do this. And you're like, oh,

487
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,840
despite accidentally hanging up on them because I thought it was a prank, actually not being scared

488
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,440
of those interviews, not, not feeling anxious about talking to another reporter. Like I think

489
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,739
that's been a real benefit. And then also working with people that are smarter than me, you know,

490
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,380
other people who are really good because sometimes you get so close to your own story and your own

491
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,760
business and you need other people to pull back and say, you know, you need to be communicating

492
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,539
this before you communicate that, because I thought that this was the business, but my cousin,

493
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,280
who's a creative has really helped me with his agency, Windsor born to kind of,

494
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,940
clarify actually what our message should be. So getting input from external people has been

495
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,420
really helpful as well, Luke. Yeah. Which leads into the next dimension,

496
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,780
how important has collaboration been for you, Miggy?

497
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:40,099
Oh my gosh. Like I, I get out of bed for collaboration. Like I'm so here for it. I love

498
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:45,059
it. I just think it's exciting. And I think as well, someone said to me, it was one of the

499
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,219
accelerators, I think, you know, sometimes people are like, I've got this business idea. I'm not

500
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:51,760
going to tell anyone. I'm just going to be in stealth. And like, and they actually said in

501
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,340
this accelerator,

502
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,340
they were like, actually, you should share your idea with everyone. Because even if someone else

503
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,179
has the vision of closing the gender pay gap and wants to start a company, firstly, that's awesome

504
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,480
because then there's two of us tackling the problem. And secondly, they're going to do it

505
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,059
differently from me. Some of the things they do will be better. Some of the things that will be

506
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,159
worse, but like, they're going to be different because they're different from me. They've got

507
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,440
different strengths. And so actually I want to celebrate those other people in this space.

508
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,420
There's so much pie to go around and also like, let's just cook a bigger pie and make more

509
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,780
opportunities for other people. That's the way I look at it. And I think, I try to have a real

510
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,139
abundance mindset about business. And I want to support my friends in particular, women-owned

511
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:38,119
businesses. We try and sort of live our values in terms of who we contract, what consultancies we

512
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,880
use, what gift companies we use. We try and focus on women-owned companies as well, just to try and

513
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,239
live those values in every way that we can. Yeah. Simon Sinek talks about worthy rivals

514
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,400
rather than competitors or, you know, people that you're not going to be able to compete with.

515
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,440
You want to defeat someone who's in your space. Doing it well is a gift because it automatically

516
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,659
makes you want to be better and improve. It is a great shift in mindset, isn't it? Because we've

517
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:08,119
all had that nervousness. Oh, someone's around the corner going to steal my idea. But you're

518
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,579
right. It's the idea of sharing it. And abundance is such a healthy way to go about it. Me, who's

519
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:18,699
been the greatest leader in your life? Oh, that's such a great question. I mean,

520
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:21,139
I think there's sort of like, there's definitely family members,

521
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,199
you know, my family, my siblings inspire me, obviously my parents, my grandparents,

522
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,099
even my grandparents who I lost really early, you know, who I hardly even remember, but just like

523
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,400
the lessons that stay with my mom, my aunts and uncles, you know, my mom lost her parents quite

524
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,019
young. And so, but those lessons and those values really are instilled in me and my cousins and all

525
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,179
of our gatherings. And then the same on my dad's side, like family is so important. And I'm so

526
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,360
grateful to have that connection with my cousins. But then I also reflect,

527
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,119
like, on a business sense, like early in my career, I had this great news director,

528
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,719
Kathy Schnitzling. I started my career at Channel 10 in Brisbane, and she was the news director

529
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,659
there. And she was like, awesome. She kind of modeled vulnerability and authenticity before

530
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:09,780
it was cool. Like she was very like hard on the table, like this is the situation,

531
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,719
highs and lows of her life. And now I reflect on that. I was like, she was kind of like

532
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:17,519
living what Brené Brown practices now, but she was doing it all those years ago.

533
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,219
And even when it comes to pay, she modeled for me, Luke, really early.

534
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,860
I was kind of there for a year or two and I was getting a bit bored and I was kind of like,

535
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,880
maybe I should get another job. I don't really know. And I didn't talk to her about it or anyone

536
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,460
about it. I just started like Googling, what should I do next? And then she called me into

537
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,360
her office and she was like, so you've been here a year, a year and a half. You should really ask

538
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:45,719
me for a pay raise. And I was like, what? And she was like, wink, wink. Like, so if you were to ask

539
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,719
for better money, possibly I could do something about that. And I was like, oh, so she was kind

540
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,380
of like leading the way. And I was like, oh, I'm going to do something about that. And I was like,

541
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,159
could I please have a pay raise? And she was like, yes, yes, you can. So she kind of coached

542
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,760
me, you know, from a really young age that it's okay to ask that there was money available.

543
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,920
And I actually wonder what would have happened to my salary if she hadn't taught me that early on,

544
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,420
because we know that, you know, if you don't negotiate your first salary, which by the way,

545
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,059
I did not, when I took the job while I was still at university, I just took what they offered,

546
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:21,199
which I think was like 28 grand or something. And I thought I was so rich. If you don't negotiate,

547
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,380
like I didn't, because of compounding interest and superannuation and all that kind of stuff,

548
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:31,000
you're going to retire with half a million dollars less than someone else who did negotiate

549
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,579
in their first job. And so again, I just try and pay that forward to anyone who will listen,

550
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,480
like, please tell your daughters, your cousins, your mentees, anyone who will listen, like,

551
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,400
please negotiate your first salary. They might say no, but if they say yes, it's going to make

552
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,000
a huge difference over the course of your career. Yeah. Great advice all around. Our space is about

553
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,199
a world of collaboration and the genius that comes out of sharing great stories like yours and

554
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:59,659
telling them in profound ways. If you could collaborate with anyone, Maggie,

555
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,840
on any of your areas of your life and you're full of passion, I can see the amazing passion

556
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
that comes out. Is there someone that you thought that's who I'd like to collaborate with?

557
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,179
I mean, there's so many people and actually this is an exercise my team and I are doing at the

558
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:21,400
moment. We're actually coming up with a hundred people, a hundred people who are further along

559
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,320
in terms of their impact.

560
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:28,079
Who we would love to collaborate with. So that's, we're literally in process of doing that right

561
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,920
now. I mean, there's, there's some pie in the sky people who we have on the list. Like when we think

562
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,500
about from a young age, women making a huge difference. Like if you look at like what

563
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,440
Greta Thunberg has achieved, like pretty remarkable. And then all the way through to,

564
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,300
you know, someone like Michelle Obama, who, when she was in the white house, really used that

565
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:50,719
opportunity to champion healthy food eating and, you know, trying to shift the, the habits and the

566
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,320
food habits of, of kids across the board. And I think that's, I think that's a really good

567
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,559
thing to do across America, because as we know, sadly, obesity is such a big challenge here.

568
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,099
And now she's doing great work again, in terms of vulnerably sharing her story and her

569
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:05,619
highs and lows of her relationship with president Obama. And I think by sharing those stories,

570
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:09,900
she's giving other people permission to know that things aren't rosy a hundred percent of the time.

571
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
So those are some of the people that I kind of admire in terms of the impact that they're making.

572
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:17,840
But again, Luke, I feel so grateful. Like we collaborate with different organizations,

573
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,139
like multiple times a week, we have a bunch of not-for-profits who we love to support as well.

574
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,579
So I, I feel like for me, the most important thing is to like, love the journey. Like the

575
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,219
destination is, is yes, there are goals. Yes, there are metrics we want to hit, but also like

576
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,179
loving jumping out of bed and like living the journey, the highs and lows every day. Like

577
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:41,719
that's, that's what I love to live and breathe. Another great piece of wisdom. I, you know,

578
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,639
friends that were at the other end of the journey and, and they say, oh, the best part was when we

579
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:51,940
were sort of scrapping and fighting and trying to find a way. And I go, I'll take sustained

580
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,699
success, you know, if you want to swap, but, but they're right. You know, I think, yeah, correct.

581
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,480
Yeah, correct. But I think you're right. Isn't it? It's the little wins and the joy along the way is,

582
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,340
is the best way to go about it. It's incredible story that you're creating and the impact that

583
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,300
you're having is such a profound thing. And congratulations to you for it, Maggie. I look

584
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,699

585
