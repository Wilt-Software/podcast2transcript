1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:08,400
Well, it is brilliant to be back with you in 2024 on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,640
Couldn't be more excited for the year ahead and thank you for tuning in.

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,879
Some really exciting guests coming up and a great way to kick off the new year.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,500
I hope you've had a happy and healthy start to the year yourself.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,239
But Michael Snyder, the Managing Director of Bunnings, is our first guest of the year.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,320
It's one of the great Australian business success stories and Mike's leadership is revered

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,739
amongst the business community in Australia.

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,200
I hope you're going to enjoy this chat as much as I did recording it and you're going

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,039
to hear some great little nuggets of wisdom from Mike Snyder.

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,179
You hear Mike talk a lot about the power of listening as a skill that he values and his

11
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,460
great pride in that 25% of the workforce at Bunnings are over 50.

12
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,659
It is a really happy home for people as they age and want to continue working.

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,000
You also hear him talk a lot about his passion for collaboration and some great advice for

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,719
anyone who thinks they're the smartest person in the room.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,560
I won't give it away, but he thinks you're setting yourself up for failure if that is

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,000
your attitude.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,420
He also really interestingly for me talks about sometimes the greatest teachers are

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,859
the ones who've gotten it wrong, that you can learn by really positive example and you

19
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,719
can learn from those that you maybe don't want to be like as well.

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,920
It's people like Mike Snyder from Bunnings who inspire the work we do at Alita and a

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,620
great way to start 2024 would be to check out alitacollective.com and our signature

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,620
Alita Connect program.

23
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,900
Where we bring together unique and bespoke groups of five to six people to learn to lead

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,459
and collaborate.

25
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,019
Love you to check out Alita Connect.

27
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,500
Big thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper for their ongoing support of the

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,420
Empowering Leaders podcast.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,719
Temper, a mattress like no other.

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,519
To get a good night's sleep is one of the great keys to a happy, healthy and successful

31
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:53,939
life.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,359
So check out Temper today.

33
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,700
Michael Snyder is the manager director of Bunnings Group Australia and New Zealand.

34
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,519
He leads a team of more than 53.

35
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,479
3,000 closing in on 400 stores with an annual turnover of $18 billion.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,460
Renowned for his genuine care and commitment to team, the wider Bunnings community and

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,620
staff are respected for their outstanding culture.

38
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,840
Mike is a great contributor to the not-for-profit world as chairman of FightMND, the Never Alone

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,860
Foundation, a board member of Corporate Mental Health Project and Melbourne United.

40
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,860
Mike, great to see you.

41
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,560
Thanks for taking the time.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,039
Thanks, Luke.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,740
Great to be with you.

44
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,800
As a 15-year-old, I understand your first job was at Target.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:34,939
Yeah.

46
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,500
You fell in love with the world.

47
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,219
You fell in love with the world of retail.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,659
What grabbed you at that age?

49
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, I think for a lot of people, when you start out, you're looking to earn a bit of

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,439
pocket money.

51
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,259
And for me, getting into a retail environment was very comfortable from an early age.

52
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,240
Being a part of a team has always been something important to me.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,419
And the engagement with customers is also something that's always been fascinating.

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,500
But I didn't really sort of start with a view that I'd spend my whole career in retail.

55
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,240
I studied to be a high school teacher, did a bit of prac teaching, worked out that wasn't

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,400
for me, and ran away from retail.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,780
For a few years, I worked at a bank, which also reminded me why I love retail.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,439
So getting back and getting to Bunnings almost 20 years ago has been incredible.

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,219
Yeah.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
So you go to the Bunnings story straight away.

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,840
And as you said, close to 20 years there now, as the managing director.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,520
It's one of the great business success stories Bunnings grew.

63
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,080
What's the key to a success?

64
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,099
Without a doubt, it's the people and the people create the culture.

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,439
I think the format's a really simple one.

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,939
Three very clear strategic priorities.

67
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,460
Lowest price, widest range, best experience.

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
It's for our customers and our team.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,900
And I think that when we stick very close to our knitting on those things, then we can

70
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,939
deliver a differentiated offer that resonates with customers.

71
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,560
I think Aussies and Kiwis have a true love for their home.

72
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,219
And I think doing things that can make our homes, therefore our lifestyles better, is

73
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:52,960
pretty compelling.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,919
I said to you just before we started recording, I was actually in your store yesterday and

75
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,979
my wife was driving.

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,419
I said, I've got to drop into Bunnings.

77
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:01,159
It's good timing.

78
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm catching up with the CEO, Mike, tomorrow.

79
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,419
And I could.

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm going to be the least handy person in Australia.

81
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,599
There's no reason for me to go to a handyman store, a hardware store.

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,839
But I walk in, she wanted to get one specific item, and I immediately go, I knew Esky would

83
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,339
be good.

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,199
That pizza oven looks good.

85
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,560
That's the only retail experience I ever go to that I actually are happy to stay around

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
and want to buy things.

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,540
How have you created that?

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, I certainly didn't create it.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,639
I've worked hard to build on what's been done over almost 30 years.

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Bunnings Warehouse turns 30 in 2024, which is a...

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
a great milestone for the business.

92
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,199
But I think it's a...

93
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,839
it's a multi-sensory experience.

94
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,639
It's somewhere where you can be working in the garden, covered in leaves and mud, get

95
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,139
up, jump in your car, go to Bunnings.

96
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,660
We don't stand on any ceremony.

97
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,079
It's a pretty straightforward shopping environment, but it touches your senses in lots of different

98
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,040
ways, from the barbecue at the front of the store on a weekend, to activities for kids

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,139
in store, or craft activities for mums or dads, or the family nights we do.

100
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,079
I think when you come to Bunnings, you can feel very comfortable.

101
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,920
You're very safe.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
You can bring your four-legged family members.

103
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,560
You can bring your friends along as well, if you want.

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,100
And hopefully, you spend a while and spend some money and keep our team engaged and keep

105
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,560
us growing.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,980
And there's genius in that, isn't it?

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,699
We can all...

108
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,839
You know, life's prices, we'll beat it by 10%.

109
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,939
The Bunnings jingle we've all got, you know, in our brain.

110
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,720
And even that, I didn't realise you could bring your dog, so you've won my wife over

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,879
for life because Dennis, the staff, he's allowed at Bunnings.

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,360
And the sausage sizzle is legendary.

113
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,620
I talked to you about that, but for people listening that have got a small business or

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,480
they're wanting to create a small business, you've got to bring your dog.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,860
Are there lessons that a scaled business at your size can teach smaller businesses?

116
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,360
I think it's all about being very clear on your why.

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
I think if you've got a sense of purpose around what you're doing, then whatever it is gets

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,079
easier because you've got clarity of where you want to go, keeping it simple, trying

119
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,920
to keep it as uncomplicated as possible.

120
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,540
And that does get challenging with scale.

121
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,199
But if you've got that focus on what you're doing, where you're going, keeping it simple,

122
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,980
and checking with your customers, make sure what you're offering is meeting a need, it's

123
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,420
delivering on expectations.

124
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,379
And I think you earn the right to be chosen.

125
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,980
And if you do that, then you've got the opportunity to scale and grow.

126
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,379
So you think that's where people get lost is that the clarity of message is not there

127
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,300
and people get confused.

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,019
And I think the second point you're saying is you've got to ask your customers, is there

129
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,360
a need for what you're trying to sell?

130
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,480
Are they the two big lessons?

131
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,379
Oh, absolutely.

132
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,920
I think so.

133
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,100
I think if you're not clear or you get distracted, then customers will get confused.

134
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,439
And if customers can't see the value proposition or don't understand what it is you stand for,

135
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,420
then you're not really doing anything.

136
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,000
You're not doing anything to be chosen.

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,540
You're not doing anything to differentiate.

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,540
And there are lots of competing agendas.

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,459
But I think coming back to what is it we're doing, why are we doing it, who are we serving,

140
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,420
they're really good foundation elements for any business.

141
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,579
Which is brilliant, isn't it?

142
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:54,339
Because I understand you've got 45,000 suppliers or thereabouts, and every product known to

143
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,220
mankind is in a bunny's warehouse now.

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,660
So you can still keep it simple, even with that array of products?

145
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,680
Oh, look, I think it gets more complex for sure.

146
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,019
We're very clear on where we think we can play and where we think we can't.

147
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,360
When you've got...

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,420
When you've got the customer traffic that a business like Bunnings has every week, let

149
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,399
alone every year, you could probably back yourself to sell a range of different things

150
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,839
that aren't really core to what we do.

151
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,620
But we really think about serving you in terms of anything you need from the front gate to

152
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,839
the back fence of your house and anything in between.

153
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,540
That's the lens through which we look at our model.

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,819
And if we can serve you in that space to make your home a better home, that's a great place

155
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,560
to be operating.

156
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,879
You just said we could probably, with that amount of foot traffic, just about sell anything.

157
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,240
How many sausages do you sell?

158
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,939
Well, the fundraising, well over 20 million a year that goes back to the community.

159
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,620
So I haven't worked it out in terms of actual sausages, but it'll be in the millions.

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,740
I know that we sell something like 7 million cups of coffee through our cafes every year.

161
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,759
So there is a lot of velocity there and a lot of demand.

162
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,959
But the stuff we do for the community is really, really special.

163
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,399
Yeah, and it resonates with people genuinely.

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,620
It feels authentic is the word that springs to mind when I walk through.

165
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,920
I hear you talk about it, mate.

166
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,740
Keep it small as one of your real values.

167
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,439
How do you do that when you've got 53?

168
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,879
I think it's got to be accessible.

169
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,439
We're really fortunate we use an enterprise social media tool called Workplace.

170
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
That keeps us engaged.

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,860
We've got close to 50,000 of our team on that.

172
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,800
We're in our stores.

173
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,740
I spent all of last week across New South Wales and New Zealand visiting teams and listening.

174
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,279
And I think that's the best place to be.

175
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,560
There's no better day than when you grab your red shirt and your apron and you know you're

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,339
going to be in stores.

177
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,459
It's a great way to connect.

178
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,500
And then when we're with our support teams or our suppliers, those stakeholders are really

179
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,299
important as well.

180
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,220
So spending time.

181
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,139
Listening, learning.

182
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,259
We just took some of our top suppliers away up to Caravan Park in Ngambi for a couple

183
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:41,600
of days.

184
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,820
Listening to what's on their mind, sharing our plans for the future.

185
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,179
And it's the same as we roll through our support officers, sit and talk.

186
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,279
And I think listening is a really important and often underrated skill in leadership.

187
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:56,940
That feels really on brand for a supplier function for Bunnings at Caravan Park in Ngambi.

188
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,960
It's not quite the south of France, Mike.

189
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,820
No, no, no.

190
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,000
We steer away from those things.

191
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,059
And there's a really nice story.

192
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,059
So many people would know that that part of Victoria is smashed pretty hard with the

193
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,220
floods recently.

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,139
And our commercial team were able to get in and work with a number of businesses.

195
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,559
And one was the Caravan Park in Ngambi and help them with materials to get the Caravan

196
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,500
Park rebuilt.

197
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,820
So they were backing us, right?

198
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,860
They were buying products from us.

199
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,440
So one way to sort of support a community that's doing it tough is actually to go take

200
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,860
a whole lot of rooms, go out a few nights into some amazing local restaurants and demonstrate

201
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,539
to suppliers that when we're backed, we back you in return.

202
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,679
It's a nice message.

203
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
And without a doubt, it's a beautiful part of the world.

204
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,639
I know.

205
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:35,840
It's stunning.

206
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,259
And Ngambi really well, actually.

207
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:39,580
Her daughter is a rower and beautiful.

208
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,519
Mitchell and Rhinery, I think, is down that part of the world.

209
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
Yeah, we had a night there.

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
It was fantastic.

211
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,000
Great part of the world.

212
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,899
So go and visit there.

213
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,419
And I love that.

214
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,039
It's great, isn't it?

215
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,639
And I meant that sincerely, isn't it?

216
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,320
If you, you know, values are only worth it if you live them, aren't they?

217
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,240
And you do go back.

218
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,820
And I'm sure that message goes back to the community in a really powerful way.

219
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,000
And speaking of community, we hear that a lot.

220
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,000
In fact, let me go one step back.

221
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,519
Because I was about to ask you, I was thinking as you were talking about 53,000 staff at

222
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:04,899
Bunnings.

223
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,019
Jeff Harris, who's one of the founders of Flight Centre on this podcast, talked about

224
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,279
doing anthropological studies around size of teams.

225
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,700
And they worked out in their Flight Centre stores, bigger teams weren't more profitable

226
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,039
or more happy or more successful.

227
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,059
And they were really sophisticated about teams of six or eight and then bigger pods.

228
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,820
Have you got a system like that?

229
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,419
Yeah, we're very tribal in our mentality.

230
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,220
So, you know, every store has got its own unique vision and values.

231
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,799
And he's measured against that, you know, once a year.

232
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,879
And, you know, we work.

233
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,080
It's very hard to make sure that the layers or the spans are as simple as they can be

234
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,340
so that we don't have big teams.

235
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,000
But also making sure that even as we get scale, we stay really close to the front line.

236
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,059
And it's a relationship-driven business.

237
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,860
You know, at 18 years into the company, I'm almost feeling like I'm off probation.

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,220
There's plenty of team around me with 20, 25, 30, all the way through to 60 years of

239
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,860
service.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,419
Or actually, longest serving team member hit 64 years this month, which is just a remarkable

241
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:03,820
achievement.

242
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,019
Right.

243
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:04,820
And I think if people...

244
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,919
If people put down roots and grow and they stay together, then building culture works

245
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,340
because you've got a lot of integrity and you've got a lot of respect from that shared

246
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,799
experience.

247
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,740
And those ingredients are the foundations of a team.

248
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,840
And if you get great teams, then they're going to win and we can celebrate that.

249
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,919
And I've read my preparation for this that, you know, you've been in a store and a customer's

250
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,720
wandering around, looks like they need help and you've jumped in and cut some carpet before

251
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
and got on the tools.

252
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm not great at all the things.

253
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,500
I'm a bit like you when it comes to handyman.

254
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,799
I'm very lucky that...

255
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,000
One of my kids is a chippy, so he normally bails me out of anything that I stuff up.

256
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,940
But I think it is important.

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,740
We have an activity we call Hammer Time, which is actually when we all go out and spend time

258
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,419
working in our stores alongside our teams.

259
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,259
And you're always looking to learn because at the end of the day, we should be able to

260
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,320
do all the different things that our team do to the best of our abilities.

261
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,919
And part of it's role modelling, but actually part of it's because we genuinely care for

262
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,120
the customers that we're lucky to serve.

263
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,720
And you talk about a community at Bunnings and the way your values are shared across

264
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
the organisation.

265
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,600
Have you got some examples around how you do that?

266
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,080
Why that works so well for you?

267
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,120
I think the thing we've always worked hard to do is have a very local approach.

268
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,299
So every one of our warehouses, our larger format stores, has a dedicated activities

269
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:19,759
organiser.

270
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,200
So they have a full-time resource purely focused on community.

271
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:31,440
And we've got a very strong skew to children, junior sport and older people, people in the

272
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,500
retired space.

273
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,379
So men's sheds.

274
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,679
Often people coming in.

275
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,299
Some nursing homes or retirement villages to do things.

276
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,139
But the idea is to sort of, to the best extent we can, make the store a hub for the community

277
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:48,419
so that community know they can use the Bunnings environment for doing activities or raising

278
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:48,740
money.

279
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,080
But we also go out into the community and we'll give makeovers to, you know, so coming

280
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,860
up to Anzac Day or Remembrance Day, often you'll find Bunnings teams around a war memorial

281
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,519
or an RSL club doing things because we know that putting back is a really important element

282
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,779
to what makes the business.

283
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,179
It's a really important element to what makes the business successful, but it's because

284
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,039
it's the right thing to do.

285
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,779
You know, ultimately we live, work and raise our families in the communities in which we

286
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,820
work and we want to be seen as strong members of that.

287
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,700
And I think that that's continued to grow over time.

288
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,940
And we don't, we deliberately don't speak to it.

289
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,179
We don't advertise it.

290
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,279
Once a year we put out a community report card, which is a very high level summary of

291
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,220
what's been done.

292
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,879
But we get the feel good factor from just doing the right thing and knowing that we've

293
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,580
done the right thing is a reward enough.

294
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,779
And I'm always a little bit bemused when I look at businesses that spend a lot of money,

295
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,580
a lot of money advertising the good work they've done.

296
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,320
I always scratch my head and think, just put that money back into doing good work and the

297
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,000
dollar will go further.

298
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,879
And Mike, you know, you listen to this story and I'm always conscious around people will

299
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,659
be saying, well, you know, what a brilliant success and you turn up and another $18 billion

300
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,299
rolls through the gate next year.

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,179
But yeah, you've had some failures as well.

302
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,759
Bunnings tried to take on the UK back in 2016, paid 340 million pounds for a chain of 265

303
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,019
hardware stores.

304
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,759
12 in Ireland as well.

305
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,360
And a short time later that hadn't succeeded.

306
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,840
I think you ended up selling out for effectively a dollar.

307
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,039
How humbling was that experience?

308
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,220
Oh, incredibly humbling.

309
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,100
And, you know, I know having been involved in the second of the two years we were with

310
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,000
the UK business, just how humbling it was standing in a room in Milton Keynes in the

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,360
north of England, talking to a room full of people and saying, you know, effectively we've

312
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,000
let you down.

313
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,019
We've sold the business where we're going back to Australia.

314
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:34,360
I think.

315
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,779
Ultimately, what you never want to be in a situation of is, is getting too far in front

316
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,179
of yourself.

317
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,620
And I think sometimes as teams, when you're winning all the time, you can forget a little

318
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,440
bit about what helped you win, but you've also got to understand the fundamentals of

319
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,080
the type of business you're operating.

320
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:56,240
And, you know, for Bunnings in 2016, you know, we'd had 20, 25 years of unparalleled success.

321
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,399
We'd been very strong in both the Australian and New Zealand market.

322
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,559
We had turnaround experience in our early days.

323
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,659
So, you know, Bunnings bought McEwen's in 1993.

324
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,500
We bought Harbour House in 2001, and both of those were a Royal Wheelock because I wasn't,

325
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,399
I wasn't there for those, but we demonstrated a capacity.

326
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,559
But come 2016, we'd been running a high performing, very successful business and bought an asset

327
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,360
that was fundamentally a turnaround, which is a different set of skills.

328
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,399
So the way I sort of liken it when I talk to our team at Bunnings is, you know, we sort

329
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,220
of took a, took a footy team and sent them to play basketball.

330
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,740
And, you know, it's really hard to do that if you don't have the fundamental skills that

331
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,120
you need.

332
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
And that wasn't the best asset in the world.

333
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,320
But with the benefit of hindsight and the market was a bit more challenging and it evolved

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,580
in some different ways.

335
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,960
I do think if we'd, we'd stuck with it over the longterm, it might've given us some different

336
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,379
outcomes.

337
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,659
But for me, looking at what we have here and the growth opportunities across Australia

338
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:53,919
and New Zealand, exiting UK was absolutely the right call, the right call for our shareholder,

339
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,419
the right call for the team there and the team here, and also our suppliers and, you

340
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:03,179
know, Damien and the team that run Homebase today do a great job of running that business.

341
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,419
And, you know, we've been able to sort of.

342
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,059
We've come back here, get really clear on where we see growth in our B2B business, in

343
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,539
our online business, in some new categories, and really go hard after that and work hard

344
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,580
to offer Australians and New Zealand's the very best in home improvement products.

345
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,320
Would you do it again?

346
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,639
Would you go overseas and take on another opportunity?

347
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,279
I think if the opportunity was right, you'd definitely look at it.

348
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,820
I think it is a challenging market.

349
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,860
We're very close to all of our global peers.

350
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,480
So whether it's Home Depot or Lowe's in the United States or Canada, Sodomac in South

351
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,419
America, Hornbach or B&Q.

352
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,720
In Europe and the UK, we understand those businesses and they are very competitive markets.

353
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,559
What we see in Australia and New Zealand is a really strong runway for growth.

354
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,960
So when you're owned by a company with the disciplines of West Farmers, where, you know,

355
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:54,000
satisfactory returns to shareholder is the mission of the business, we can see a way

356
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,120
to do that very successfully for many years to come here in the domestic market.

357
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,659
Did the Bunnings message not translate to the UK?

358
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,700
Is that too simple a way to think about it?

359
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,639
It certainly did.

360
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,140
We converted.

361
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,740
We forced stores to Bunnings actually in the UK by the time we left and it was resonating.

362
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,480
What the challenge was that we faced was that the underlying business, the home-based business

363
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,500
was what we would call a very soft DIY space.

364
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,500
So for our listeners here, it's imagining, you know, where Bunnings meets a Freedom Furniture

365
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,380
or something like that, where you've got a lot of softer furnishings and homewares products.

366
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,220
And Bunnings is more of a true DIY player, you know, true home improvement player with

367
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,839
power tools and timber and green life and those sorts of things.

368
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,980
And, you know, customers would come into Bunnings, they liked what they saw, but they were really

369
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,579
yearning for what they'd had, which was more of the home-based model.

370
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,819
And interestingly, the success of home-based today has been going back to doing what they

371
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,119
were doing before, just doing it, doing it better.

372
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,599
And I think those competencies and skill sets are really important learning.

373
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,059
I work really hard to make sure that inside Bunnings today, we never forget that experience

374
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,259
because it is a reminder that you can go out and give it a hundred percent and still get

375
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,319
a thumping and that keeps you on your toes and keeps you hungry for better performance

376
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:07,799
in the future.

377
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,420
Well, it looks like you live a really full life.

378
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,980
You see you contributing in a range of different areas.

379
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,480
What does success mean to you?

380
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,119
I think success is leaving positive legacies.

381
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, I didn't come to Bunnings in 2005 to be the managing director and I like to

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
get involved in things outside of work.

383
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,880
I think we've all got unique skills.

384
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,140
I like to jump on a barbecue.

385
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,660
I've done plenty of them as my kids came up through junior sport.

386
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,819
I've done scouts and those sorts of things.

387
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,119
So I think being hands-on where it makes sense is important.

388
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:43,019
But equally, if I can lend networks and skills to raising money, whether it's for research

389
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:49,180
into MND or support for mental health or any of those things, I think that's what is incumbent

390
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,660
on us to sort of pay forward really the opportunities we've been given.

391
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,839
And I like being busy.

392
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,420
It certainly is a very fulfilling way to get about and live your life.

393
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,900
How do you manage your time?

394
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,000
It's a lot of competing, running a business.

395
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,180
So that scale and, you know, chair a fine MND, a great cause, contribute, see the basketball

396
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,680
as a board member of Melbourne United.

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,319
It's a full life.

398
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,900
Do you get the balance right?

399
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,019
Depends who you ask, probably.

400
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,660
I don't think so, but I think that's okay if you're happy with that.

401
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:25,700
You know, and I think ultimately what I'm really fortunate to be able to do with the

402
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,019
flexibility of my role and the other opportunities I have is live what I'd call a very integrated

403
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:29,359
life.

404
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,759
So, you know, I can be doing something on a Saturday or Sunday.

405
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,779
That's very Bunnings focused and it might be a Tuesday afternoon doing something with

406
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,339
vitamin D.

407
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,319
And I think as long as you sort of, you know, delivering the outcomes that are there and

408
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,259
you apply yourself in the right way, then you can, you can get things done.

409
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,500
And, you know, to be very fair, I stand on the shoulders of thousands of other people

410
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,700
who do really great work every day and supporting them and coordinating things for them or getting

411
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,819
issues out of the way.

412
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,660
That's really what I'm about.

413
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,200
And if I can do that and, um, and balance it, then I'm having fun.

414
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,400
And that's a great way to be.

415
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,740
Might we say success leaves clues.

416
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,940
And in the leader world, we're seeing different leaders in different areas and fascinated

417
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,240
around the patterns of leadership that we've identified that we think are consistent.

418
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,700
So I want to ask you a range of questions along those lines.

419
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,180
The idea of self-leadership for us is where it starts.

420
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,220
It's hard to lead 53,000 people unless you know yourself well, what does self-leadership

421
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,700
mean to you?

422
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,500
For me, it's very much, you know, a little bit about what we touched on before, which

423
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,200
is a sense of purpose.

424
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,019
So for me, it's about creating environments in which other people can be successful.

425
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:32,740
I think earlier in my career, it was, you know,

426
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,460
probably more of a sort of a personally driven, you know, I want to see positive change.

427
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,839
And I think as you, you get into a position where you do have a lot of responsibility,

428
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,240
empowering others to do that and holding them to account is important.

429
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,019
And I think you've got to have the self-discipline to, to be able to show that you're putting

430
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,660
in the hours and doing the work.

431
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,180
And that's not just doing the actual work.

432
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
It's doing the training to get you ready, whether it's your, your physical health or

433
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,319
your mental health, um, your family health, all those things are important.

434
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,740
And, you know, along the way over the years, I've hit my 50s.

435
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,140
Fair share of speed bumps when it's come to, uh, family or, or work, not everything

436
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,359
is, is plain sailing for any of us in our lives.

437
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,819
And I think, um, learning from that, sharing those experiences, uh, helps keep you real

438
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,859
and, and helps people understand what you're about.

439
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,059
Mike, we see leaders are really conscious around on a daily basis, positively impacting

440
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,500
others in their environment.

441
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,059
I, I suspect you get a chance to do that regularly with the scale of, of your work.

442
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:31,119
Do you give that thought about that positive impact on a daily basis, how you go about

443
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,259
it?

444
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,740
Yeah, I think, you know, a team teller.

445
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,200
It's very clearly reward and recognition is really important.

446
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,559
And just something as simple as saying, thank you, recognizing people, popping a comment

447
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,240
on someone's post on our internal social media feeds.

448
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,579
Um, you know, when we were in Sydney last week, I had the privilege of presenting a

449
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,740
20 and a 25 year service award, uh, at one of our Sydney stores, you know, those things

450
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,819
are always fantastic.

451
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,440
And, you know, we do what we do because other people have done good things for us.

452
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,720
Right.

453
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,440
And, um, you know, all of us in our careers, if we're successful, can look back at the

454
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
people who've helped us.

455
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,819
So that mindset of helpfulness, which leads into reward and recognition is something that

456
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,660
is very important to me.

457
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,079
Yeah.

458
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:05,920
It's interesting, isn't it?

459
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,700
Those little celebrations are a free hit sometimes, but often overlooked, isn't it?

460
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,079
When the.

461
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,099
Often it's the little things that are actually bigger than the big ones.

462
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,859
It's the thank you.

463
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,140
It's someone just knowing that, you know, they put in an extra bit of effort somewhere

464
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,119
can mean a lot more than making a big deal of someone in a, in a group.

465
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Yeah.

466
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,220
Which I find fascinating at the scale of people that are potentially in contact with you as,

467
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,359
as the head of Bunnings and 53,000 people, you know, it's a, it's a clear vision Bunnings

468
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,240
has got.

469
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,119
And as you said, you've built on the back of it, but how do you go about creating and

470
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,579
sharing that people are constantly coming into that environment?

471
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,119
What are the techniques you use around that, that vision and keeping it real?

472
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,460
Yeah, it's so important.

473
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,180
And, you know, certainly has been tested at different points in time.

474
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:54,680
Our business grew really significantly during the pandemic years when we were all spending

475
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,039
lots of time at home.

476
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,740
And that meant we recruited a lot of people.

477
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,119
And, you know, I'd be.

478
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,660
Better say we, we did see a dilution of culture because we had such a, a rapid growth.

479
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,180
So we've gone back to a lot of the basics around how we, uh, induct our team, you know,

480
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,559
all of our leaders go through a very consistent leadership experience, uh, leadership development

481
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,259
programs.

482
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,160
We're very fussy about the people we recruit, you know, often joke that having a heartbeat

483
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,039
alone, isn't a reason to get a job at Bunnings.

484
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,640
We want people that want to work with teams.

485
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,720
We want to get people who want to engage with customers are really fortunate that, you know,

486
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,220
over 25% of our workforce raged over 50, they come with a lot of life experience and a lot

487
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,740
of skill.

488
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,059
And, um, you know, that gives you a really strong blended outcome, uh, you know, in terms

489
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:38,240
of workforce, but it's also making sure that we're actively engaging and listening.

490
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,680
So we're running engagement surveys and those vision and value surveys I touched on earlier.

491
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,460
They're really important because if we're not hearing what the team is saying, then

492
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,339
we're not well equipped to show we've got the processes and the policies and the activities

493
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,579
in place to, to meet their needs and make sure that they see Bunnings as a, as a place

494
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:56,460
to build a great career.

495
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,900
It's a great contribution.

496
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,140
The elderly work.

497
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,119
And, you know, 50 suddenly elderly isn't, I used to, I used to, I used to sort of have

498
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,140
a little grin on my face when I was under 50, that happened a couple of years ago.

499
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,859
So I'm now part of the, the sort of 26 or 27% of our team.

500
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:16,619
But, um, you do get so much experience from, you know, having lived life a little bit and,

501
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,339
you know, participated in different activities, whether it's raising a family or doing other

502
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,940
things, uh, professionally, and you can just see the confidence that they bring into, into

503
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,460
the business.

504
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,220
Is that strategic to Bunnings that you actively try and pursue the overview?

505
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,440
50 workforce, or is it just the nature of the business?

506
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,579
It's a little bit of both.

507
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,519
I think we're very, we're very mindful of it and we see the value.

508
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,859
You know, I'm always, um, sad when I, when I talk to someone who's, you know, a little

509
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:43,759
bit older and maybe he's gone through a redundancy or a change in their career and they can't

510
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,240
find a, a place to start over.

511
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,700
You know, we've got a team with 20, 25 year service who joined us at 50, right.

512
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,200
And they're in their seventies now and they're, they're loving it, but we see the value.

513
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,539
And I think we are a natural home.

514
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,500
If you're a, you know, a chippy or a plumber or a spark, you're a builder and your body

515
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,220
gets a bit sort of.

516
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,279
Broken down or you've run your business successfully, but you don't want to be at home full time.

517
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,740
Uh, then, you know, Bunnings offers a really great place to, to do a bit of work and, you

518
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,039
know, probably share the experiences that you had, you know, in your trade with, with

519
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:12,539
other people.

520
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,660
We see curiosity as a, as a common thread for the leaders we, we talk to and through

521
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,400
that curiosity, they're, they're constantly learning and wanting to be better.

522
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,660
Is that something that resonates with you?

523
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,200
Oh, without a doubt.

524
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,220
You know, I think putting a sort of a retailer's hat on first, you know, we're very

525
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,319
fortunate to live in a, in a great country here in Australia and you see all the challenges

526
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,799
around the world that that's a constant reminder of that, but we're also a long way from

527
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,539
anywhere else and very easy to believe that, you know, we, we do things, um, the best,

528
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,619
you know, every year we're out with our suppliers in factories, in other retail stores, you

529
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:47,039
know, I've been to pretty much every continent this year.

530
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,779
Um, we don't have any home improvement stores in, in, um, in the Antarctic region.

531
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,119
So I didn't go there, but pretty much everywhere else, because we are always looking to learn

532
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,319
and we are very curious.

533
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,180
And I think, you know, when you've got a.

534
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,420
A mindset of being the best you can be, um, constant improvement comes from constant learning

535
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,380
and constant learning doesn't happen unless you've got that inherent interest in, in what's

536
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,160
going on around you.

537
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,599
Who's the best retailer in the world?

538
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,460
Oh, I think Walmart or Home Depot are probably the two, um, that are head and shoulders.

539
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,039
And I had the privilege this year of going to both their head offices, Walmart in, in

540
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,240
Bentonville and, and Home Depot in Atlanta and their office in, in Toronto as well.

541
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,940
And, you know, their scale, you know, you talked about Bunnings at 18 billion.

542
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,180
I think Walmart's 660 billion and Home Depot is about 160.

543
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
70 billion.

544
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,460
So, you know, there's lots to learn from those businesses and scale gives you some challenges,

545
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,700
but it gives you huge advantages and their investments into technology and data and those

546
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,980
sorts of things has been profound.

547
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,720
Are they up for sharing?

548
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Yeah, pretty much.

549
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,299
Um, you know, we've got good relationships with them.

550
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,740
We've worked hard over the years to not only take ideas from, from these businesses, but

551
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,279
also share ideas back when we were with, uh, the West Farmers Board in, in Toronto earlier

552
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,480
this year, we were walking a store with my counterpart from Home Depot Canada, and we

553
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,160
were talking about a number of different things and he was able to show our board the things

554
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,299
that he'd learned from the relationship with Bunnings, just like we could show them the

555
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,299
things that we'd learned.

556
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,660
And I think when you're not competing, that, that creates a great environment and that's

557
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,380
probably one of the reasons why, you know, we haven't actively looked at other markets

558
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,380
as well.

559
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,259
We actually value the relationships that we've got and we get as much from that as, um, as

560
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:19,259
anything else.

561
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:25,200
How, um, have you gone about communicating with clarity in a business like yours?

562
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,480
What sort of processes you put in place to get that right?

563
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,579
Well, it's, it's about the simplicity of the language.

564
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,579
You know, when you've got a workforce our size, the reality is we're going to have people

565
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,579
that can't read and write.

566
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:38,240
We're going to have people where English isn't, isn't a first language, uh, and, and all the

567
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
different challenges that come with learning difficulties and those sorts of things.

568
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,779
So, you know, when we, we talk about our stores, we want, we would just say we want them to

569
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:45,779
look full clean and tidy.

570
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,779
It's a pretty simple, uh, mindset.

571
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,299
You know, we talk about, um, you know, safety.

572
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,839
We talk about everyone going home, you know, in the same condition they, they came in in

573
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,839
the morning.

574
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,140
We, we'd like to use very simple language.

575
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,599
We want, don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

576
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,859
We take what we do very, very seriously in terms of the work that happens at Bunnings,

577
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,180
but we don't take ourselves, uh, very seriously.

578
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,140
And I think if you can keep the language simple, people get engaged, we encourage questions

579
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
to be asked.

580
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,539
We, we share best practice then, um, you know, everyone can buy in.

581
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:18,099
And if you've bought in then, you know, staying focused on, on what your mission is, is a

582
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,220
little bit easier.

583
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,640
You mentioned some of the collaboration before traveling the world and Walmart and Home Depot

584
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,839
and, and, and learning from, from others.

585
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,579
How important has collaboration been to you?

586
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,579
To your success?

587
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:33,119
Look, I, you know, when you're, when you're almost an accidental retailer, we talked about

588
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,339
the sort of start of my career, you know, a little while back and certainly, you know,

589
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:40,839
to some extent, you know, an accidental managing director, you know, as I said, it wasn't the

590
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,839
job I came to do.

591
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,559
And, um, I was really privileged to be given the opportunity.

592
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,259
I think in some ways I have one of the best corporate jobs in the country, just given,

593
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,579
given the brand and the fact that we're part of a great larger company in West Farmers.

594
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:57,200
We also then don't have to deal with as many of the external factors that other listed

595
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,019
retailer companies have to do.

596
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:03,759
Um, I think if you're in that position and that collaboration piece is just, is just critical,

597
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,759
right?

598
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,599
And, and making sure that you're learning from others is how you're going to be able

599
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,759
to get the job done because you certainly don't come prearmed with all the skills.

600
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:16,700
I had big shoes to fill in 2016 when I took over from my predecessor and, um, you suddenly

601
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,460
go from unconsciously incompetent to very consciously incompetent.

602
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,579
You go from not knowing what you don't know to knowing what you don't know.

603
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,200
And the only way you're going to get to have any semblance of credibility is to, is to

604
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,559
collaborate really hard so that you can bring the best of everyone's skills to the fore.

605
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,559
Unconsciously incompetent.

606
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,559
That's a fascinating term.

607
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,880
And I think, yeah, having that openness, isn't it?

608
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,039
You don't know what you don't know to step into a role, but, and that's what we love

609
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,740
about the idea that if collaboration isn't, if you're prepared to say that the answers

610
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
are there, aren't they?

611
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,019
If you're, if you're, you know, humble enough to look for them.

612
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:51,700
And people I've never been, I've never not been surprised at just how generous people

613
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,759
are if you ask for time.

614
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,759
Um, and I've always been very mindful.

615
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,000
If people ask time from me that I, I pay that forward.

616
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,319
Um, but if you're prepared to ask the questions, most people are very willing to jump in and

617
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,319
help you.

618
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,000
Um, but they're just waiting to be asked.

619
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,440
And I think if you've got the, the, the self-awareness to go, I'm not very good on that, and I need

620
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,880
to ask someone, I need to educate myself, then that can be really helpful.

621
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,259
And I think that's where leadership goes off a cliff where someone, you know, merges into

622
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,259
a leadership role.

623
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,759
You describe yourself as an accidental MD of a massive business.

624
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,119
And then you're scared to say.

625
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,960
You're scared to say, I don't know.

626
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,359
And so you push down a lot of things and suppress a lot of things and try and manage up.

627
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,539
And you know, that, that goes pear-shaped pretty quickly, doesn't it?

628
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:36,539
Very quickly.

629
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,039
And I think anyone who positions themselves as the smartest person in a room is setting

630
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,099
themselves up for failure because, uh, we've all met people like that and normally just

631
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:48,799
sit back and go, I'm just going to watch the car crash unfold because you've seen it play

632
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,799
out many times.

633
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,240
And, uh, the best leaders that I've ever worked for and, and worked around are the ones that

634
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,599
are looking for buy-in.

635
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:54,680
Yeah.

636
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,859
Looking for buy-in, looking for feedback, and more importantly, looking for challenge

637
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:01,240
because we don't have all the ideas and we don't have all the solutions.

638
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,859
I think of, uh, John Bertram, we're lucky enough to collaborate with John in our leader

639
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,460
world and he drops into the various collaborative groups that we're in and, and, you know, John

640
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,740
75, hall of fame, legend in his space, the most curious person I think I've ever met.

641
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,160
And he takes this, um, inside and he's, he shared this on the podcast.

642
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Every room he walks into, I assume I know absolutely nothing.

643
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,920
And, and with someone with that amount of wisdom, it's a, it's a profound way to burn.

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,619
You can say, well, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

645
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,700
I don't think there's been anyone.

646
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,619
I think I've worked for lots of great leaders, you know, across, across the years.

647
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:36,759
Yeah.

648
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,319
My predecessor, John Gillum at Bunnings is absolutely fantastic.

649
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,259
You know, my very first store manager, Van Wilkinson back in the early nineties that are

650
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:47,460
in target and everyone gives you something, um, to build on.

651
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,400
And I always, you know, often get asked that question when I speak to some of our younger

652
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,720
leaders.

653
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,140
And, you know, I think, I think learning from leaders is a bit like going to a, you know,

654
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,579
a buffet, you take the bit, you, you, you load up on the bits you really like and you

655
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:58,759
avoid the bits you don't.

656
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:02,500
And equally, I've worked for leaders that I've learned a lot from, but it's actually

657
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,779
learning what I don't want to be.

658
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:08,380
Cause I understand the impact of, uh, behavior of language on how it's made me feel.

659
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,480
And I would never want other people to feel the way I felt in a moment.

660
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,740
And I think being aware of that is just as important as being like the, the people you

661
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,019
look up to in terms of the experiences that they've shared.

662
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,140
It's a great answer, Mike.

663
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,279
I haven't had anyone quite answered that way.

664
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:22,700
And it's true.

665
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,839
Often we sort of push away the people that are at a negative impact on it.

666
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,599
But if we stop and think sometimes, as you just mentioned, they're our greatest teachers,

667
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:29,880
aren't they?

668
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,599
Because I don't want to reflect that behavior on someone else.

669
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,799
And you can learn just as much along the way.

670
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,019
We are obsessed with collaboration in our world.

671
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:41,759
And I think it sounds like you are too, and flying around the world.

672
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,259
Is there been one particular pair you probably mentioned already with, with Walmart or have

673
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,099
you gone, that's, I'd love to spend an hour with that person to collaborate and in any

674
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,059
part of your passions.

675
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:52,680
And you've got me.

676
00:32:52,700 --> 00:33:01,500
I've been spending a bit of time in the last couple of months with a gentleman by the name

677
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,900
of Frank Blake and Frank is the former president and CEO of Home Depot.

678
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,900
So Ted Decker is the, is the current president and CEO.

679
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,759
And Frank was one of his predecessors.

680
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:17,059
And when you've been there and done it in the industry in which we work and to have

681
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,420
the insights that he's had, I've certainly learned a lot from him and a lot of just

682
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,519
leadership.

683
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,559
You know, one of the things you share with me is that when you're in a CEO or MD role,

684
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,940
you know, to some extent you're the frog in the pot that the organization boils.

685
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,960
And I'd never really thought about, you know, leadership through the lens of once people

686
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,819
get to know you, they work out a little bit of what you like things to be like, or don't

687
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:43,759
like things to be like, and, you know, over time things tend to sort of migrate to a way

688
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,059
where they, they operate in a way that can almost serve the, serve the leader.

689
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,380
And, you know, how do you sort of step back from that and go, I don't want to be unpredictable

690
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,259
consistency.

691
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,299
It is really important in leadership, but I also don't want to be managed in a, in a

692
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,079
sense of being handled or anything like that.

693
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,140
I want to be able to roll my sleeves up, be a part of the team, get involved in conversations.

694
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,960
And, you know, so you're constantly looking to sort of shape and evolve.

695
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,400
So I think when you can meet people with such wisdom, then, you know, you can just learn

696
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,280
so much from them and take that on board and think about ways that they've engaged.

697
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,699
And if you're really lucky, and I've very much been the case with Frank, they'll also

698
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,760
tell you the things that didn't work.

699
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,619
So the things to look out for, or the early warning.

700
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,179
Warning signs that something might go wrong.

701
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,440
And I think they're always very useful as well.

702
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,659
I've certainly learned a lot this morning, sitting down with you.

703
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,739
I really appreciate you and an incredibly busy schedule, taking some time to share your

704
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,579
wisdom and you can see the passion and the clarity.

705
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,260
And as you described, maybe the great corporate job in Australia.

706
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,199
We all love Bunnings.

707
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,699
And I think it's no small part because of your leadership.

708
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
So I really appreciate your time.

709
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,699
Thanks so much, Luke.

710
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,260
Really enjoyed spending time with you as well.
