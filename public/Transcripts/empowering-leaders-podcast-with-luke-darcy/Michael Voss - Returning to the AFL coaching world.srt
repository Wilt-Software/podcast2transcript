1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:09,679
My conversation today is with AFL legend Michael Voss.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,460
Vossier has described himself as a ruthless yet passionate leader on the field.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,879
He's evolved his style of leadership over time.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,620
He's now coaching a very different generation of young men

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,780
with different wants and needs from him as their leader.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,039
In this conversation, we discuss how Michael Voss' communication

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,000
is one of his greatest tools as a leader,

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,839
how he's overcome the need to be liked, his growth mindset,

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,500
and how getting his group to buy in is one of the most important things

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,119
that he does as the head coach of the Carlton Football Club.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,359
Michael Voss is a considerate leader, I would describe him as.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,140
He's got great determination and a real inspiration in everything he does.

13
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,880
His passion for what he does is one of the fundamentals of the work we do

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,960
at our leadership business, Alita, and we're incredibly proud

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,000

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,060

00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,659
Michael Voss is a Hall of Fame triple premiership captain

23
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,959
of the Brisbane Lions, universally regarded as one of the all-time

24
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,239
greats for Australian rules football.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,019
He was voted by his peers on four occasions as the AFL Captain of the Year,

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,659
a Brownlow Medalist, two-time AFL MVP, five-time All-Australian,

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,780
and received just about every other award the industry has to offer.

28
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,599
Voss is currently the senior coach of the Carlton Football Club,

29
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,599
having previously been...

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,599
and the head coach of the Brisbane Lions for 109 games from 2009 to 2013.

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,780
An inspirational leader, renowned for his courage and determination.

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,959
Voss, you're always great to see.

33
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:49,640
Thanks for joining me.

34
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,000
Sounds like a fair journey, it does.

35
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,340
So, well done there.

36
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,219
Sounds like a good CV, mate, is what it does.

37
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,019
And full of great success, mate, in everything that you've done.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,980
And, you know, I look back and, you know, I think from the very first time I met you,

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,340
you've always had a sense of presence.

40
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,300
When you walk into a room, no matter what the company,

41
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,599
you can almost feel Michael Voss is in the room.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,860
Have you always seen yourself as a leader from a young age?

43
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,259
No, I definitely didn't.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,199
Even when I was at 21 and asked to do the job, you know,

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,400
at the Brisbane Lions at the time, it comes as quite a great shock to me.

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,599
And I remember that conversation sitting down with John Northey and, you know,

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,419
he said, mate, we'd like you to be, like to be co-captain with Alistair Lynch.

48
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,280
And it came at a great shock.

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,639
And I said, look, I don't want to, I don't want to sound like I'm not really keen,

50
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,319
but I just, this is, this is a real shock to me that I've been regarded like this.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,639
So I had to go away and have a think about it without saying yes straight away.

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,680
But having some conversations, ironically,

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,439
probably the most influential conversation I had was with Chris Scott.

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,659
And he said, mate, we want you to be, we want you to be the captain.

55
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,319
So I think without that counsel, I might've said no.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,620
So it's amazing with the sliding doors and then you become captain for a while with Lynchie

57
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,000
and then you take it on yourself and you sort of grow into the role, I think.

58
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,020
I guess the more comfortable you become in your role and more presence you have within the team,

59
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,659
you start to feel like that's when you start to have your influence.

60
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:24,960
Yeah, it's fascinating.

61
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,759
You know, Chris Scott, he'd become a great leader in his own right

62
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,419
and coaches said you longed to great success.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,759
And, you know, young teammate of yours at the same age.

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,039
And, you know, Chris has got a great amount of presence about him.

65
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,259
Was that someone that you sought out around that age and thought,

66
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,740
do you think I should do it?

67
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,080
Is that one of the people you went to?

68
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,120
Well, we had a number of guys through that time where we were all roughly the same age

69
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,659
and we all come together and there was this peer group that was starting to establish

70
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,439
and some of the older ones were moving on and some of the younger ones were coming through

71
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:02,039
and fortunate enough to have guys like Nigel Lappin and Chris Scott at that time,

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,319
Justin Lippich as well.

73
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
So we started to become the next group coming through.

74
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,560
And so I guess Chris's advice more at the time was that this peer group

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,500
or that demographic of age is getting larger and larger

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,879
and we feel like we need one of presence within that group

77
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,360
and we'd love that for you to be you.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,759
And so that was the conversation.

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,740
And, yeah, I guess without that conversation, I probably wouldn't have taken it on.

80
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,139
Yeah, interesting.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,779
And we know the history of those that follow Australian rules football.

82
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,160
We know that Vossie went on to be a triple premiership captain, as I said in the intro.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,680
And the names you mentioned are alongside him, Nigel Lappin,

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,220
and Chris Scott, Justin Lippich, also all-time greats of the game that we both shared.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,839
Speaking of presence, mate, I have this image in preparation for today.

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,500
I can see it crystal clear playing against you in the early days.

87
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,839
I think I know what game you're going to be in.

88
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,160
Well, I don't know.

89
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,339
You might have a story back for me, but I can picture it.

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,379
And you mightn't think of this one, but I can remember being at a Boundaries throne.

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,199
You come smashing through the contest.

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,279
You win the footy.

93
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,339
You clean up one of our midfielders.

94
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,740
It ends up in a goal.

95
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,620
And, you know, we're probably getting belted at the time.

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,040
And I remember jockeying back to the centre bounce, and you were admonishing yourself.

97
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,300
You were sort of hitting yourself on the thigh.

98
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,620
That would have been the highlight of the game for most of us.

99
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,939
But I think, you know, you'd had a slight fumble.

100
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,959
I don't think anyone on the ground would have picked up that it was a two-touch grab,

101
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,259
even though you won it perfectly.

102
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,439
And I thought, geez, this guy's got perfectionism.

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,079
Is that how you play the game, with wanting to be perfect at it?

104
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,160
I think it was more the ruthless nature that I enjoyed more.

105
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,300
And that is something that I grew into as well.

106
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,620
I mean, one of the really big things that I had to overcome by being a leader

107
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,480
was actually the need to be liked.

108
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,420
And for a lot of my time, I actually wrestled with that concept quite a fair bit.

109
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,379
I actually cared with what a lot of people would say about me,

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,060
even how the opposition might even say things about me.

111
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,220
And it'd actually affect me if it come back the other way.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,199
And I learned a couple of really valuable lessons through my time there.

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,279
And I just thought, oh, I'm never letting that happen to me ever again.

114
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,180
It really affected me.

115
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,259
And so I started.

116
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,439
I started to make it personal and started to make it more ruthless.

117
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,939
And I was going to earn respect a completely different way.

118
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,839
And that meant being quite combative, both physically and also mentally.

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,980
And there's been some games that you sort of think, oh, geez,

120
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,540
I really went a bit too far there.

121
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,199
You know, I was really in the moment there, wasn't I?

122
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,720
And you only hear some of those stories back now.

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,399
But I just enjoyed.

124
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,740
I guess I grew to like that part of the game.

125
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,560
I don't think it was naturally within me,

126
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,939
but somehow it sort of was drawn out of me and it sat comfortable with me.

127
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,879
I remember the ruthless edge as well.

128
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,500
I still remember seeing that up close and personal.

129
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,100
That is, again, I've never heard you say that,

130
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,100
that initially you did take it on and you had to train yourself that way.

131
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,819
Because it always felt like playing against the teams you were captain of.

132
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
Even when, you know, we could be down 10 goals at the end, it's over.

133
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,040
And you'd be, you guys would still be giving it to us with three minutes to go.

134
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,259
It's almost like we'll leave some scar tissue for you for next time.

135
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:05,519
Yeah.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Was that it?

137
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,519
Was that part of it?

138
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,079
And, you know, and is that still how you coach today?

139
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,399
Oh, absolutely.

140
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,879
You know, I think when you look at humility, you know, you can,

141
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,839
there's a hard edge in humility as well.

142
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,759
And fortunate enough to have some really humble moments early in my career

143
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,139
where I was taught some pretty big lessons in that regard.

144
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,399
And playing against West Coast Eagles teams and playing against John Wurstfold

145
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,399
and, you know, being bashed up and then going to Geelong.

146
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,100
And being bashed up there.

147
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,279
And so I think it's almost, I sort of write a passage

148
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,540
that you sort of learn these lessons as you go.

149
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,519
And you sort of learn what that ruthless looks like.

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,439
And, you know, so humility to me still has that hard edge.

151
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,259
It's not an arrogance.

152
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,100
It's just saying, well, you know, I'm going to play the same way.

153
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm not going to stop what I'm doing.

154
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,279
And I'll play to the final siren.

155
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,079
And this is the way that I go about it.

156
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,779
And challenge others to raise the game.

157
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,519
But don't worry.

158
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,879
It comes back at you at some stage.

159
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:04,899
So.

160
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,540
So as you start to tail off and you get a bit older, Darcy,

161
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,319
and there's a fair bit that comes back your way.

162
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,519
So what goes around comes around.

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,939
But I guess I love that part of the game.

164
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,920
Do you ever regret one?

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,040
Do you ever think, you know what, I wish I could take that one back.

166
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,420
I overstepped the line.

167
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,879
No.

168
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,740
Well, actually, there is a game, Darcy, and you might know this

169
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,800
because we have had some great clashes with the dogs

170
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,220
over that little period of time.

171
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,399
Quite competitive with Libertore and Ramiro.

172
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:39,299
And I remember, you know, I got quite personal

173
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,940
in terms of just, you know, being at that ruthlessness

174
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,399
and I was just at it the whole day.

175
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,580
And we had some great exchanges as two teams

176
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,240
that didn't mind that little bit of banter

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,100
and certainly didn't mind that physicality

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,740
and probably boiled over at the end of the game.

179
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,080
And I remember him coming over and trying to shake my hand

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,019
and I just didn't shake the hand and sort of kept moving on.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
And I went back late.

182
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,820
I actually went back and shook his hand.

183
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,940
I said, oh, mate, yeah, no, the game's over.

184
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,679
Because I was still as much as I'd like to play the game on the edge

185
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,279
when the siren sounded, it was over.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,659
And then we carry on.

187
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,539
I think I remember Tony Libertore in that game

188
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,879
calling you the worst Brownlow medalist ever, I think.

189
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,799
He did it one stage.

190
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,200
It might have been another game.

191
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,919
And I remember thinking, jeez, that's not going to age well,

192
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,320
that comment, but as you said, that was the nature of the combat.

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,899
Whatever you thought could maybe unsettle someone,

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,580
it was fair game, wasn't it?

195
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,379
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,220
And look, I think that, and I talk about this often

197
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,799
when I go to corporate and like what you did at the opening,

198
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,460
you read out a CV and they're all the great moments.

199
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,899
They're all the great memories that you have.

200
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,679
But I think the things that sit with you

201
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,879
are all these little exchanges that happen

202
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,919
and little lessons you learn along the way

203
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,759
that teach you certain things and prioritise

204
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,580
and teach you what's important and what's not important.

205
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,700
And that's where I've had my biggest lessons.

206
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,360
It hasn't been in the greatest of moments.

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,700
It's been in these little exchanges of people

208
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,200
that have challenged you in lots of different ways

209
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,899
and then just try to reflect back on that

210
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,799
and what would you do differently next time

211
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,299
and then you grow off the back of that

212
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:20,100
and just been having that continual growth mindset

213
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,960
to be better and want to be better

214
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,220
and have some humility in that you don't know it all.

215
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,759
And I've had moments where I felt like I've known it all

216
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,519
and got it wrong and plenty of other times

217
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,220
where I felt like I've been open enough

218
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,580
to accept the fact that I've done it.

219
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:33,639
Yeah.

220
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,320
The feedback that's needed to come my way.

221
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,259
And that's where you evolve, I think, as a leader.

222
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,259
And that's where you're, as a leader,

223
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,340
I think you can certainly evolve your style over time for sure.

224
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,559
Yeah, I want to touch on that.

225
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,139
Speaking of growth mindset,

226
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:50,440
and we sort of laugh about that era and those stories

227
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,100
because they're sort of the war stories

228
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,759
that are told from our generation.

229
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,779
But it was a pretty brutal era

230
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,299
and you played under coaches like Robert Walls

231
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,039
and it was certainly a ruthless edge

232
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,299
to the way coaches were in our generation.

233
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,539
But tell me about,

234
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,659
your evolution now as a leader

235
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,159
because you're coaching a very different generation

236
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,480
of young men and very different needs.

237
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
How have you changed?

238
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,759
Yeah, well, I think if you just compare the,

239
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,860
I guess my first go at it at Brisbane compared to now,

240
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:22,899
I've sort of likened it like having a new hard drive.

241
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,779
You're sort of repackaging it with different experiences.

242
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,399
You're rewiring it with different beliefs and systems

243
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,220
and then you go on at it again.

244
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,100
And that's probably for the last,

245
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,120
seven years or report was that was part of that process

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,960
was going back, working on your craft

247
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,120
and trying to better yourself in the areas

248
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,179
and targeting some specific areas you think

249
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,919
that you need to get better at.

250
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,679
And I was really lucky as well

251
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,679
that I had some good leaders around me

252
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,500
that I could learn off.

253
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,179
And certainly the one things that really impressed me

254
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,220
with Ken spending some time with Ken Hinckley

255
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,279
as the head coach of Port Adelaide

256
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,620
and his ability to be able to let people do their jobs

257
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,019
and, you know, but keep them really,

258
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,840
really highly accountable at the same time.

259
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,940
He wasn't at the forefront in front of the players

260
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,720
all the time.

261
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,840
He let the coaches lead their areas.

262
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,779
But in behind the closed four doors,

263
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,019
he was pretty ruthless in his intensity

264
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,879
to make sure that we were across everything

265
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,799
and that we were covering it off.

266
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,519
And if we weren't, he was challenging us.

267
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,500
And I really liked that.

268
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,500
And then people as a result could flourish.

269
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
They could put their flavour on things.

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
They could bring their creativity.

271
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,100
They could own it even more.

272
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,000
And, you know,

273
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,100
you hope that you get more out of people because of that.

274
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,799
So that's been a really strong influence for me

275
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,679
in now having another go at it

276
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,639
and let people be able to do their jobs.

277
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,899
It's pretty important.

278
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,820
And also a little bit with the players as well

279
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,480
is trying to tap into that as well

280
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
so they can problem solve themselves

281
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,500
and they can provide solutions for themselves

282
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,539
and give them the skill sets that they need to be able to do

283
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,539
to be able to get the job done.

284
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,360
Yeah, the title of this is Empowering Leadership, Voss.

285
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,139
It sounds like that's what you're describing.

286
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,820
And we see that as a real trend now around modern leadership.

287
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,840
I know you can't be on top of everything.

288
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,919
In fact, people don't want you to micromanage everything

289
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,100
and you need to have that.

290
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,340
And it's hard, isn't it,

291
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,059
for people that have had great success, you know,

292
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,039
by working harder than anyone else to let go is challenging.

293
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
But without it, you know,

294
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,860
it seems it's hard for people only to really be their best, isn't it?

295
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,580
Is that a constant challenge for all of you?

296
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,019
Oh, absolutely.

297
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, like coaches are control junkies.

298
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,240
There's no doubt about that.

299
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,919
And so trying to control every outcome is just impossible.

300
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,360
So the way we try to do that is we try to provide an environment

301
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,100
and a training environment where players get to explore more things.

302
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,620
They get to be able to, you know, mistakes are embraced,

303
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,700
imperfections are embraced, and you have to be able to, you know,

304
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,399
vulnerability is embraced because without vulnerability,

305
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,799
you can't have creativity.

306
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,299
You cannot innovate.

307
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,220
So and then you find out where the possibilities lie in between that,

308
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,480
and that can sometimes help shape the next place you go to.

309
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,480
Whereas if you stay really rigid and you don't provide those opportunities,

310
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,360
well, it becomes quite narrow in what you can actually achieve.

311
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,320
So we all have frameworks.

312
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,740
We all have philosophies.

313
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,960
But we want to sort of obviously make sure that we're still bringing people's

314
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,139
strengths to the table and getting the best out of them.

315
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,879
You mentioned, you know, your first time as a senior coach.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,500
It's the club that you're famous for and arguably the greatest, you know,

317
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,759
player in the history of the Brisbane line.

318
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,320
You then take on the senior role as coach and you have success.

319
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,360
You know, in 109 games, and then they sack you.

320
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,039
We don't mention that in the intro on these things because you talk about,

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
I mean, tell us about that.

322
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,779
I had huge admiration for you, as you said,

323
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,139
going back to your craft and the humility to say,

324
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,759
I'm going to learn again second time around and be an assistant

325
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,860
under Ken Inglis-Puertolo.

326
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,600
But how hard was that at the start?

327
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,279
And how did you, you know, evolve as a person through that time?

328
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,960
Oh, that was hard, yeah.

329
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,659
When you get sacked, and anyone can probably speak to this,

330
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,159
but, you know, you invest so much time into something

331
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,519
and you're pouring all your knowledge and your family's impacted

332
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,100
because this job's not, it's a lifestyle.

333
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,500
You know, coaching's a lifestyle.

334
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,720
So your family's in on it.

335
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,460
You know, you pour so much into it.

336
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,000
So then when things don't go the way that you want it to, it's personal.

337
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,879
And then what you've got to, after all that,

338
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,460
you've got to sit back and then sort of get people to cast judgments on you

339
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,759
about what,

340
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,799
what worked and what didn't work.

341
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,940
And there's some truth in that.

342
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,820
And then there's some, there's some mistruth in that.

343
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,659
And so you've got to try and navigate out what's real and what's not real.

344
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,840
So once I got over the initial,

345
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,440
the initial hurt of it all and could sit with it,

346
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,919
my next little part was, okay, what was real and what wasn't.

347
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,440
But when I reflect back on it now and had some time after that,

348
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,659
I sort of thought, well, you know,

349
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,320
they've probably actually done me a favour here.

350
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,799
You know, it was tough getting back to this seat.

351
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,500
Um, it was a bit harder than I thought that was going to be.

352
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,399
But at the same time, you know, when I looked at it,

353
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,940
it just wasn't the right club with the right person at the right time and it

354
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,480
didn't work.

355
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,120
And, uh, and so they went their way and I went my way and, um,

356
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,919
they're doing well and hopefully I can do well at a, at another club.

357
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,879
Hard when it's the club you had that especially hard, isn't it?

358
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,919
That, that amount of impact.

359
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,740
But can you share,

360
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,059
is there anything you can share with us when you say what's real and what's

361
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:28,580
not real?

362
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,759
So you're trying to sift through and so, you know,

363
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,659
you know, you're not perfect first time around.

364
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah.

365
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:32,799
Yeah.

366
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,519
No one ever is.

367
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,080
But was there something tangible you say, geez, you know what?

368
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,500
I had to learn that skill and that's made me better now.

369
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,559
Is there anything that comes to mind?

370
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,799
Yeah.

371
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,000
Look, the main one was the,

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,460
the potential distractions you get involved in or could get involved in.

373
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,799
Um, and as such, it's interesting now coming in,

374
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,919
one of the first requirements, um,

375
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,000
going through the job was I want to have a relationship with the players and

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,460
the coaches.

377
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,440
Like I must be able to,

378
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,460
we've got to put a structure in and around it that,

379
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,000
that enables me to be able to spend time with players and be able to give

380
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,019
them clarity about what they need, um, to succeed.

381
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,079
Um, because I felt like that wasn't quite the case.

382
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,000
It wasn't the case at Brisbane.

383
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,759
So my relationships really suffered.

384
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,019
Um, they weren't as deep and weren't as rich as what they needed to be.

385
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,720
And I found myself drifting off in all these other, um,

386
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,119
other places and all these other people problems and, um,

387
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,599
trying to control lots of other things within our program.

388
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,440
And, um,

389
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,819
it just took me completely away from the playing group.

390
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,319
Um, so not deliberate, not intentional, but that's what happened.

391
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,579
And as a result of that, um,

392
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,099
your relationships suffer and, uh,

393
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,779
you don't get to spend as much time with them.

394
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,140
Um, and probably as a by-product of that,

395
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
I've never actually received that as a reason.

396
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,700
Um, but that would be my interpretation of it for sure.

397
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,579
So then coming back in and,

398
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,880
and sort of now with what we try to achieve, um,

399
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,359
with the current structure that I have there.

400
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,200
And I talked to Brad Lloyd,

401
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,339
our GM manager about this is that it has to support me.

402
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't care what it looks like,

403
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,119
but it's got to support me to be able to do that.

404
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,059
Um,

405
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,460
so small wins I have is when the coaches are out planning training and I'm

406
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,339
sitting in with a player and I'm having a meeting with them and the coaches

407
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,099
are doing their thing and I'm doing my thing.

408
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,380
I just see those as little wins.

409
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:19,819
Yeah.

410
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,220
And building those relationships you see is,

411
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:22,599
you know,

412
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,380
really integral part of you being,

413
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,440
because my perception of you is that you're a great relationship person.

414
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:29,559
People love,

415
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,039
you know,

416
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,180
being in your company as a player and as a coach,

417
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,279
it was not as though that was,

418
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,900
that part was,

419
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,980
it was just allocating the time.

420
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:35,460
Yeah.

421
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,000
Time.

422
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,299
Yeah.

423
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:36,839
Um,

424
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,920
and just in the,

425
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,160
the,

426
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,819
the timely conversations as well,

427
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,200
you know,

428
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,720
you can just,

429
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,640
you can address things as you go.

430
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,539
You don't let them fester.

431
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,380
You don't let them pile on top of one another.

432
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:46,140
Um,

433
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:46,759
you know,

434
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,900
I've been very big on that as well as problems arise,

435
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,519
solve them,

436
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:51,579
have the conversation,

437
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,660
don't let them sit,

438
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,460
don't let them duplicate.

439
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,400
Um,

440
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,559
and you know,

441
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,000
that's,

442
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,619
that's been a,

443
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,460
it's a really big one.

444
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,579
And,

445
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,160
and we tend to shy away from those conversations a lot.

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,079
Um,

447
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,460
and I probably didn't have enough of those,

448
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,019
you know,

449
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,920
that I needed to have,

450
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,000
whether it was just,

451
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,500
it wasn't set up that way.

452
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,680
I didn't have the time that way,

453
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,680
or I didn't have the relationship for him to be able to embrace it.

454
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:12,940
But,

455
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,359
um,

456
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,619
yeah,

457
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,000
affording time to be able to have those conversations is time well spent.

458
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,839
And likewise with coaches,

459
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,920
the only reason why you can sort of get coaches to be able to go out and do

460
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,039
what they do is because they're clear.

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,000
Um,

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,279
we're all on the same page with how we're actually going to play or,

463
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:28,740
you know,

464
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,099
what our standards need to be.

465
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,660
so,

466
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,380
so lots and lots of conversations,

467
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,559
which is probably why you become exhausted at the end of the day.

468
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,000
It does.

469
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,819
I was staggered that,

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,299
you know,

471
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,299
it took you so long again to be sitting back into the position you are now,

472
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,160
head coach of a,

473
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,279
of an AFL club.

474
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,839
You know,

475
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,460
for me,

476
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,279
you know,

477
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,960
seeing you from the outside as this credible competitor,

478
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,180
lifelong learner,

479
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,519
finds a way,

480
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,660
no matter what the obstacle,

481
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,220
was that hard that the industry took a while to say,

482
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,839
Hey,

483
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,140
we value you again.

484
00:19:59,519 --> 00:19:59,640
Yeah,

485
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,140
it was,

486
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,599
it was strange to ask,

487
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,000
because,

488
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,619
you know,

489
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,319
as a player,

490
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:04,779
um,

491
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:05,859
when you finish your career,

492
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:06,720
um,

493
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:07,039
you're,

494
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,400
you're a person that of interest,

495
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,359
they,

496
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,880
they want you.

497
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,839
Um,

498
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,319
and then when I finished Brisbane,

499
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:14,960
I was,

500
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,140
I wasn't that person of interest anymore.

501
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,940
And the phone calls stopped coming.

502
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:19,759
Um,

503
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,980
there's lack of interest in yourself or,

504
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,180
um,

505
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,480
so that,

506
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,160
that was actually,

507
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,039
that was actually really sort of tough,

508
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,819
a little bit,

509
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,480
um,

510
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,259
and quite different.

511
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:28,920
so,

512
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,680
you know,

513
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,940
sort of fighting your way back in.

514
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,599
I spent some time,

515
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,779
in the media for a little while.

516
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,359
Um,

517
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,200
that was a great,

518
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,839
um,

519
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,259
time away from coaching.

520
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,980
Gave me a different perspective.

521
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:38,980
Um,

522
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,319
enabled me to be able to think and reflect a lot.

523
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,900
And then stepping back into the coaching,

524
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,599
the next part was just being,

525
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,740
using it as a,

526
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,339
just to be as clear as I possibly can on the philosophies that I really,

527
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,420
that I stand for and that I'd like our program to,

528
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:53,940
to be.

529
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,240
Um,

530
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,099
and then when you step in,

531
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,880
you have that clarity,

532
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,759
you can get it.

533
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,839
But there was plenty of times where it was close.

534
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,420
And I thought this is it.

535
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,619
And then it got taken off me.

536
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,980
And then when this last one came around,

537
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,140
it looked like it was nearly going to be taken off me again,

538
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,859
because Clarko was asked one more question about whether he was going to coach again.

539
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,160
I thought,

540
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,299
oh,

541
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:13,920
this would be right.

542
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,279
He'll say yes.

543
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,079
And I'll be in the same boat.

544
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:18,380
So,

545
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,099
I have to thank Clarko for saying no and giving me the opportunity to be able to step in.

546
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:23,380
But,

547
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,779
so no,

548
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,140
I didn't,

549
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,440
I've got to admit,

550
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:25,839
um,

551
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,940
certainly initially,

552
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,400
it was much harder than I thought it was going to be.

553
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,519
And then there was a point where I thought,

554
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:31,660
oh,

555
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,460
it's never going to happen again.

556
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:32,759
Really?

557
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:33,200
Yeah.

558
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:33,660
Yeah.

559
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,059
Yeah.

560
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,059
I mentioned the term lifelong learner,

561
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:36,559
Vossi,

562
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:36,859
and I,

563
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm not surprised that,

564
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:38,500
you know,

565
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,980
I get to cross over with you again in,

566
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,460
in this chapter in a space that,

567
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,900
uh,

568
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,759
my old mate and great friend,

569
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:44,220
Matt Waterworth,

570
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,940
and I are really passionate about called Alita Connect.

571
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,880
And I remember sitting down talking to you and I love Stardew Island.

572
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,059
He said,

573
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,180
look,

574
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
I want diversity of thinking.

575
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,380
I've spent my whole life around other athletes and coaches.

576
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,319
And if we're going to set up an Alita Connect group where we bring different leaders together,

577
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,160
that was your,

578
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,400
that was your immediate thing.

579
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,819
You know,

580
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,500
I want some different thinkers around.

581
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:01,779
And I,

582
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,279
and I love,

583
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,680
um,

584
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,960
and I've had the great pleasure of,

585
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:04,259
uh,

586
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,299
taking a while to get to you,

587
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,579
but I've spoken to all the other guys in your group.

588
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:07,839
Dr.

589
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,359
Chris Brown,

590
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,359
who's just a beautiful human being and an amazing person.

591
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,859
Richard Oppie,

592
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,680
the global head of marketing at Budweiser,

593
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,119
an old friend doing extraordinary things.

594
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,299
He's got incredible wisdom,

595
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,339
rich Benjamin Northey,

596
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,839
the conductor,

597
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,420
legendary conductor and,

598
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,140
uh,

599
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,779
Melbourne orchestra,

600
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,160
but revered around the world.

601
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,980
And so bringing that artistic brilliance,

602
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,619
Trent Robinson,

603
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,740
who has got a bit of you about him.

604
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,180
I think he's got a big heart and,

605
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,660
you know,

606
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,200
three-time premiership coach in the NRL.

607
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:31,400
Can,

608
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,500
can you tell us about,

609
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,420
you know,

610
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,759
why that's been important for you,

611
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,339
why that's worked and about the group?

612
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:37,720
Well,

613
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:38,900
I think what we end up doing,

614
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,740
cause we live in our bubble.

615
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:40,420
Um,

616
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,799
you can,

617
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,240
you can sort of be confined in your thinking at times and,

618
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,960
you know,

619
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,660
link being able to explore anything like that is,

620
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,119
is about expanding your thinking.

621
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,940
It's about expanding your circle and,

622
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,220
and putting a different,

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,920
um,

624
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,539
I love people have a,

625
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,079
just a different angle on bringing conversations,

626
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,480
um,

627
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
to the table and the way that they think.

628
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,500
And,

629
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:01,079
and,

630
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,960
and you know,

631
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm more than happy to be able to turn 360 or 180 on something.

632
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,740
If I've got a view and then having a conversation with another person,

633
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,839
they give me a completely different perspective on it.

634
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,220
And it just makes you really think deeper about yourself.

635
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:15,859
Um,

636
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,779
why you see the world as it is,

637
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,400
um,

638
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,420
and then see someone else's perspective on it.

639
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,319
Um,

640
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,099
I get great nourishment from that.

641
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,799
Um,

642
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,579
so the creativity part is actually really important to me and having

643
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,299
conversations with all those guys,

644
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:31,839
um,

645
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,559
has been extremely useful.

646
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Um,

647
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,200
you know,

648
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,839
talking to,

649
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,640
to Rich about,

650
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,240
you know,

651
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:38,000
brand and,

652
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:38,279
you know,

653
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,319
hear him speak about his world and some of the stories that he's,

654
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:42,519
uh,

655
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,319
covered with has been quite exceptional.

656
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,079
Um,

657
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:45,720
you know,

658
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,359
and then just being able to listen to,

659
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,259
to everyone in their own stories and,

660
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,359
and what they're going through and some of the problems that they've faced or

661
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,579
challenges they've got ahead of them.

662
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,779
And for him to have those open conversations,

663
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,720
I just find it incredibly enriching.

664
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:58,420
Um,

665
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,940
and you learn so much.

666
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,579
Um,

667
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:01,119
and just,

668
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,519
they're completely transparent,

669
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,160
um,

670
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
which is,

671
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,079
I'm really loving.

672
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:05,579
Um,

673
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,539
I think sometimes when it's in your own world,

674
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,339
you can be a bit more protective potentially.

675
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,119
Um,

676
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,500
you know,

677
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,920
if it's another AFL coach or it's another assistant coach or it's AFL,

678
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,180
you can be a little bit protective,

679
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,319
but,

680
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,539
um,

681
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,319
it just feels such like an open conversation and open dialogue.

682
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,900
And so you get so much out of it.

683
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,859
And I think that trusted confidential environment,

684
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:24,799
and that is part of,

685
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,140
um,

686
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,900
a little can it non-competing industries for that exact reason.

687
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,119
I think you wouldn't be able to,

688
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,119
to share.

689
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,000
And they are private,

690
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,059
but conversations and,

691
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,920
and clearly you're not going to share them.

692
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,059
I have had people listen to this in the past and say,

693
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,880
you know,

694
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,380
I don't quite understand the mechanics of what it is.

695
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,880
Can you do a better job than me around,

696
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,640
around how it works in terms of how often you catch up and,

697
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,519
and how often,

698
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,119
how long the meetings go for and,

699
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,039
and how you make it work in your busy schedule?

700
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,519
Well,

701
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,579
I think it's about,

702
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:51,880
well,

703
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,700
you just got to set the time.

704
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,019
I mean,

705
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:53,599
that's just the,

706
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,599
what it comes down to,

707
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:54,920
um,

708
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
which is incredibly difficult.

709
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,059
And one of them's in New York.

710
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:57,559
Um,

711
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,319
so it's,

712
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,619
uh,

713
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,839
it's incredibly challenging,

714
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,799
but at the same time,

715
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,039
um,

716
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,180
you know,

717
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,980
we catch up initially once a month.

718
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,519
Um,

719
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,380
you know,

720
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,960
we have some slight structure to that,

721
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:06,460
um,

722
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,480
around what we want to,

723
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,160
what we want to table and what conversations,

724
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,799
uh,

725
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:10,539
are there.

726
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:10,900
So we,

727
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,779
we have conversations around those and then post that period of time after,

728
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,200
you know,

729
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,400
I guess the first 12 months,

730
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,599
if you want to call it that it's,

731
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:17,900
uh,

732
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,299
it's over to us and,

733
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:19,579
you know,

734
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,960
whether we want to continue that relationship and,

735
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,059
um,

736
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,660
and it's still,

737
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,940
still obviously facilitated.

738
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:25,740
Um,

739
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,539
and we catch up probably once every five weeks and,

740
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:28,940
uh,

741
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,039
we only have one just,

742
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,519
uh,

743
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:30,779
better,

744
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,240
a week ago.

745
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,940
Um,

746
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,640
and again,

747
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,460
really enriching conversation.

748
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,359
Um,

749
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,359
you know,

750
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,940
initially they're,

751
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,700
they're meant to be about 75 minutes long and we never stay on time.

752
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,900
It's always longer than that.

753
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,880
Uh,

754
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,619
just because,

755
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:48,119
you know,

756
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:48,920
the conversations,

757
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,779
um,

758
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:50,240
you know,

759
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,960
it's just good to see where everyone's at and,

760
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:52,359
and,

761
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,000
and what they're,

762
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,460
what problem are they bringing to the table?

763
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,599
Um,

764
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,779
so generally I'll bring a theme or a question and then we unpack that question or we unpack

765
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:00,440
that theme.

766
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,839
And,

767
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,200
um,

768
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
and it's really enjoyable.

769
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,200
We,

770
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:03,519
uh,

771
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:03,779
you know,

772
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:04,099
I believe,

773
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:04,700
um,

774
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,480
Chris Brown was,

775
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:05,839
you know,

776
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,980
the back of a combi van in,

777
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,119
in Iceland and dialing in in the middle of the night.

778
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,559
And so,

779
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,200
you know,

780
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,259
it's a great credit to the connection you guys have,

781
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,880
have created that people just,

782
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,259
uh,

783
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:14,579
you know,

784
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:17,799
busy people find a way to take that time to self reflect them.

785
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,359
I mean,

786
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,099
it's a bit intimidating when you've got,

787
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,619
you know,

788
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:23,839
people of your background and success and there's success everywhere there.

789
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,900
But a lot of people say,

790
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,079
am I someone that would benefit from that?

791
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,539
Would you recommend it to someone who,

792
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,559
whatever they're doing,

793
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,220
education,

794
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,039
or a small business?

795
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,240
Do you think it's applicable to,

796
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,019
to a wider audience?

797
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh,

798
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,660
I think it's absolutely applicable because what,

799
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,819
what you effectively,

800
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,759
uh,

801
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,420
you're doing is you're bringing out of the club.

802
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,680
You're not,

803
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,400
you haven't got a classroom theory environment here.

804
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,380
It's all experiential.

805
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,660
And,

806
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,559
and so we,

807
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,819
um,

808
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,900
so all of it is about experiences that all of us have having and the common

809
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,000
problems that come up that as a leader,

810
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,500
you don't often get the chance to be able to put around the table and just,

811
00:26:59,680 --> 00:26:59,819
you know,

812
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,200
problems,

813
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,119
solve all together.

814
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,859
And when you're a key,

815
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,500
when you're a leader and you need to make key decisions,

816
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,099
there's a lot of things going through your head and you're working out all the

817
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:12,460
pros and all the cons of every decision that you're going to make.

818
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:12,880
So,

819
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,400
and at times being able to just go,

820
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Hey guys,

821
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,960
this is the thing that's occupying my mind at the moment.

822
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,759
Can you help me out?

823
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:19,720
Um,

824
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,079
you know,

825
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,819
this is where I'm thinking of going.

826
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,880
What do you suggest that I need to be able to think about,

827
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,079
you know,

828
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,539
what are the,

829
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:27,660
what are the things I need to go back with?

830
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,259
Um,

831
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,839
and that's put on the table and then we,

832
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,039
um,

833
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,000
and then we unpack it,

834
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:31,579
um,

835
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
extremely useful.

836
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,700
Um,

837
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,279
because I reckon every time that we've had that type of conversation,

838
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,880
there's been something that someone's taken away that they hadn't considered

839
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,119
yet.

840
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,099
Yeah.

841
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,259
We're going to wrap to,

842
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:42,460
uh,

843
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,160
to be able to collaborate with you bossy and,

844
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,440
uh,

845
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,940
and your wisdom in that is,

846
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,099
uh,

847
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,599
is profound as well to,

848
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:48,940
to the Carlton fans,

849
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,279
this thing.

850
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,539
And I,

851
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,819
and they will be not in 95,

852
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:52,660
it's 28 years ago.

853
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,799
Last time Carlton had the ultimate success,

854
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,660
one of the proudest,

855
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,279
most successful sporting organizations in the world,

856
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:58,839
really.

857
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,900
But it's been a long time.

858
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,400
I mean,

859
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,220
is that the dream for Michael Voss to be at the helm of,

860
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,539
of the next time they win it?

861
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,079
Clearly,

862
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:06,319
um,

863
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:06,859
you know,

864
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,000
that'll be a special day.

865
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,240
I wouldn't,

866
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,259
if you could take that one.

867
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:09,279
Oh,

868
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,099
be an appetite.

869
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,200
There's an appetite for it to us.

870
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,799
There's no doubt.

871
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,640
Um,

872
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,559
and I do dream of that moment.

873
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:15,799
Um,

874
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,759
how can't you,

875
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:16,940
that's,

876
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,240
uh,

877
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,640
sometimes keeps you going every day,

878
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:19,940
um,

879
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,180
when you're lost in the weeds and you're trying to sift through the next problem.

880
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,359
Um,

881
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,799
you sometimes just nice to remind yourself of the reasons why you're doing it.

882
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,039
But,

883
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,279
um,

884
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,000
I look,

885
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,839
it's a massive club.

886
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:29,880
Um,

887
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,400
yeah,

888
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,279
there's no doubt.

889
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:31,400
Uh,

890
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,140
I guess there's no doubt a weight of frustration amongst the,

891
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,680
amongst the fan base.

892
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Um,

893
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
and it's probably 10,

894
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
20 years long.

895
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Um,

896
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
the challenge within all that,

897
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
of course,

898
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
is that we still have to stay in the present and we have to,

899
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
you know,

900
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
our weight has to be by,

901
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
you know,

902
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
playing the way that we want to play,

903
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
um,

904
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
investing completely in that.

905
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
And,

906
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
um,

907
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
it has to be in,

908
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
you know,

909
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
being a great teammate and,

910
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
uh,

911
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
and how do I do that?

912
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
And,

913
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,460
and,

914
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
and,

915
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
and,

916
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
and,

917
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
and,

918
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
and,

919
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
um,

920
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
you know,

921
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
there's not too much responsibility towards those things.

922
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Um,

923
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
so keeping the players completely present,

924
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
um,

925
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
and the impact they want to have on the Carlton football club is really important to them.

926
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Um,

927
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
they're a hungry bunch.

928
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Uh,

929
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
they're really hungry bunch.

930
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
And,

931
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
uh,

932
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
so I know,

933
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
I know when you sort of stay hungry and you have a really strong desire,

934
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
you'll get the best out of,

935
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
get the best out of them.

936
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
You feel that,

937
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
that navy blue army,

938
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
uh,

939
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
is starting to get their voice back.

940
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
And we saw a bit of that,

941
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
uh,

942
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
last year.

943
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,380
I think they've all finished school and doing their thing.

944
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,700
But what are you like on the home front as a leader in the family?

945
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,119
No, my wife's the leader of our family.

946
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,259
Donna's?

947
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,880
Yeah, Donna is the leader of our family.

948
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,000
There's no doubt about that.

949
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,220
Why do you say that?

950
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,339
Well, I rely on her because, you know, I guess the thing with at work,

951
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,259
you know, and she says this to me often, you know, you're so organised,

952
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,599
you're, you know, to-do lists and you've got a schedule planned

953
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,839
and, you know, you're organising things and having all these conversations

954
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,059
and you come home and it's tools down.

955
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,339
And I go, yeah, I know.

956
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,099
I said, because I see you as the leader of this family, not me.

957
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,799
And she does such a wonderful job at it.

958
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,720
And, you know, so I rely on her.

959
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,579
Where are we going next?

960
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,259
What are we doing?

961
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:14,940
Where are we going?

962
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,660
Who are we visiting?

963
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,660
What have the kids got on?

964
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,220
You know, so it's, yeah, it probably does frustrate her at times,

965
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,220
but I really rely on her to be able to lead

966
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,539
me in that environment.

967
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,339
What a gift in life though, Voss, isn't it?

968
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:31,420
To have a partner that clearly compliments you.

969
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah.

970
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,859
It's probably about as good a thing as it can be.

971
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:35,960
Oh, mate, it is.

972
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,839
And I guess the big thing that within, I get asked the question a lot around,

973
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,619
you know, separating work and home and I've sort of, I don't think,

974
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,420
every person I've asked, in fact, we've actually tabled this conversation

975
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,960
amongst it and I think the universe, we're all agreeance that it's,

976
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:55,779
no one's perfected it.

977
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,319
That when you've got people who are really great in their field,

978
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:03,980
being able to separate it from time to time is really, really difficult.

979
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,180
But one thing I like-

980
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,980
Separate work and home and get that balance right.

981
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,900
Get that balance right.

982
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,680
It's really difficult.

983
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:14,380
But the way I guess I always sort of answer that is just be totally present

984
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,019
where you are.

985
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,500
And so if that means if you've got two hours with your family,

986
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,099
spend two hours with your family, both spiritually, physically,

987
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,440
mentally, like, just be totally present.

988
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:25,819
Yeah.

989
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:25,960
Yeah.

990
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah.

991
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,079
Yeah.

992
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,140
Yeah.

993
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,180
Yeah.

994
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,200
Yeah.

995
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,299
Yeah.

996
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:26,319
Yeah.

997
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:26,339
Yeah.

998
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:26,579
Yeah.

999
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:31,500
And that's all that my wife's ever asked of me is just that if you are going to be

1000
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,859
here, then just be present.

1001
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:37,440
And so I've tried to stay true to that, but I certainly wouldn't say that I've perfected

1002
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,660
that.

1003
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,180
So the phone.

1004
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,559
Phone down.

1005
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:40,980
Yeah.

1006
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,339
Yeah.

1007
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,740
So I used to have little things like with the kids when the kids were younger and because

1008
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,400
they love these games and it's all about like self-accountability.

1009
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,839
So it was $5 in the jar every time that the phone, you know, if I picked up the phone

1010
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,559
or the wrong time and I'd take a phone call and it was dad five bucks.

1011
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:56,579
Yeah.

1012
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:57,359
In the, in the jar.

1013
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,440
So in the, in $5 goes in the jar for whatever they wanted.

1014
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,839
And, um, so they were almost hunting me down around corners.

1015
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,940
Getting your mates to ring me.

1016
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,460
Getting your mates to ring me.

1017
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,539
So when they were kids, but I needed that discipline at that particular time to be able

1018
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:12,259
to see that through.

1019
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,539
But, uh, no, I certainly don't perfect it, but, um, I would say if I've got any advice

1020
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,279
for anybody, it's just be totally present.

1021
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:24,359
And that's a good lead in bossy to the dimensions of leadership that I love asking, uh, great

1022
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,220
leaders like you and starting with self-leadership.

1023
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,339
And I see, yeah, enormous self-leadership in, in you and your life.

1024
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,539
How do you describe that for you?

1025
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,900
Well, it's, yeah, well, it's leading self.

1026
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,420
I mean, first and foremost, you, you have to, you have to be able to lead yourself,

1027
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,920
um, to be in a position to lead others.

1028
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,880
And, um, we probably don't spend enough time on that.

1029
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,519
So having, having some really strong self-awareness, um, particularly when you're in positions

1030
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,019
like, you know, coaching or, you know, your CEO of a business and you've got, you have

1031
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:55,920
to rely on that.

1032
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,500
And, um, you know, I'm, I'm really big on being able to continually ask people about

1033
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,619
what's going on and just checking the pulse of the group and the environment and what's

1034
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:06,859
happening.

1035
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,119
Cause it's all feedback for you to bear, to, to help you where, where do I need to go next?

1036
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:16,240
Um, but more importantly, I've also, you know, learn around just, you know, stay healthy.

1037
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,859
Um, you know, uh, try and find some time for yourself, um, because as the stress is built

1038
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,299
up, the more distracted you become.

1039
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,140
So, um, that's why I feel is actually really important.

1040
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,200
Yeah.

1041
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,619
And part of leading self is, you know, having healthy regime.

1042
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,819
Um, again, I haven't been quite as disciplined as that as I'd like to be, but it seems to

1043
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:39,279
stack up every time when you find that real sort of health time, um, and personal time

1044
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,839
just to be able to relax and what that looks like is really important in being able to

1045
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,839
have all the energy you need for others.

1046
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,180
Um, when you go in there and you need to lead, you've got the energy to do so.

1047
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,680
Stories just coming to mind.

1048
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,819
I just hadn't thought about it, but we, um, crossed over, you remember, I think we both

1049
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:56,200
retired the same year.

1050
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,200
And we, we're doing, uh, some coaching together at the Institute of Sport, taking the best

1051
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,259
young, 30 young AFL players, went up taking them to South Africa a couple of years in

1052
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:05,539
a row.

1053
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,480
It was a good, I loved it.

1054
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,059
It was a great experience.

1055
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,199
It was a good time, wasn't it?

1056
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,940
But I, uh, there's a few stories out of that trip, but I remember you, you know, we're

1057
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,639
mentoring these young kids and I remember you turning around and going, right, we're

1058
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,780
going to catch up in, you know, eight weeks time, go South Africa, skinfold challenge

1059
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,619
for the coaches.

1060
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
And I remember thinking, mate, the war's over.

1061
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,519
I said, well, I've just retired.

1062
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,920
I don't need to be, to be.

1063
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:26,719
But you know what?

1064
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,320
You sowed that seed and it was like, I'm on here.

1065
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
I'm on, we're training.

1066
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,119
You know, is that about your own sense of self going?

1067
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,500
I wanted to do that and I'm going to.

1068
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,179
I needed, I needed to be, I liked being competitive.

1069
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,940
So that was my way of being competitive.

1070
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:44,360
So I actually think I was the only one in that competition, I think, but it was, it

1071
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,199
was good for me.

1072
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,280
So I didn't, I didn't mind.

1073
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,280
You turned up in good nick next time we saw you.

1074
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,300
I know, I know that much.

1075
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,360
How do you think about positive impact in your environment?

1076
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,059
It's probably what your job is, you know, as an AFL coach, but do you

1077
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:56,199
constantly.

1078
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,260
Think of that day to day, how do you impact the environment positively?

1079
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,500
Oh, absolutely.

1080
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,219
You know, there's, there's, there's critical things that you think about to

1081
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,920
create that positivity, you know, and, and some of that's been even just the way

1082
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,659
I've probably changed the way I've led, you know, little things like looking at

1083
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:21,440
people's strengths, you know, not seeing faults in people all the time.

1084
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,539
And in coaching, you almost hide to find faults, right?

1085
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,980
You know,

1086
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,679
just asking the question, you know, what'd you like and, and having the response of the

1087
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,179
group, you know, at all being positive, um, rather than looking at an edit and sort of

1088
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,260
picking through the holes of all the things that are wrong in it.

1089
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,860
Well, yeah, we can do that all day long.

1090
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,599
Cause in every edit, there's something that's wrong.

1091
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,320
Um, but I didn't ask that question.

1092
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,480
I asked the question, what did we like about it?

1093
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,159
Um, and so it's a different type of question to ask.

1094
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,800
Um, I'm very big on modeling heroes, um, within your program.

1095
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,519
Um, we spend a lot of our energies, um, often on the people that we're working with.

1096
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:55,960
Um, and so it's a different type of question to ask.

1097
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,780
Um, but I find that if you're, if you model your heroes, um, then 80% of the group want

1098
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,559
to get the same pat on the back.

1099
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,679
They want that reward.

1100
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,840
They want to be acknowledged for doing the right thing.

1101
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,659
No one turns up on a day and wants to be terrible.

1102
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,139
Um, they want to learn how to do it right.

1103
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,280
And, uh, so very big on those.

1104
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,420
So, um, very big on gratitude, um, around focusing on what you have as opposed to what

1105
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,900
you don't.

1106
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,900
And, uh, so that.

1107
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,539
Underpins your philosophy as a coach because, um, you have to provide that.

1108
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,920
That doesn't mean you're shy away from performance conversations.

1109
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,059
It doesn't mean you don't hold people accountable to the jobs they need to be able to perform.

1110
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,719
Um, there are still avenues and opportunities to be able to do that, but there is a balance,

1111
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,239
um, to how you go about that.

1112
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:42,900
Yeah.

1113
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,400
I love hearing that, that language from you.

1114
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,059
I remember as a player and you'd be injured, you might sit in the coach's box and all you

1115
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:52,960
heard was he can't kick, he's a terrible mark, can't trust him on his left foot.

1116
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,340
It was just one after the other.

1117
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,599
And I remember.

1118
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,719
Thinking, isn't the art of coaching, getting players to do what we need them to do and,

1119
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,860
and you're right, became this sort of self-fulfilling perpetuation and negativity too much, wasn't

1120
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:06,980
it?

1121
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:12,300
Rather than God, if we coach that person to do that, he's going to be fantastic in his

1122
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,539
role.

1123
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,000
It sounds like you've got that right at the forefront of your mind, creating and sharing

1124
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,340
a vision.

1125
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,480
We see leaders like you pretty clear on how they do that.

1126
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,840
I think we probably all know your vision at Carlman might've spoken about it before the

1127
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,699
success is obvious.

1128
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:29,280
But how do you, how do you go about getting the whole group to buy in on that?

1129
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,940
Um, talking about it often, um, what's, what's actually really, uh, important at the start

1130
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,260
is that, uh, everyone, every sort of, everyone has a say on the way forward.

1131
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,380
You know, like if there's one thing I've learned about, you know, groups now is that they want

1132
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,920
to have, they want to belong to something and they want to own, they want to own something

1133
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,099
and, uh, and having a say on that direction actually really, um, inspires them to want

1134
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:55,679
to be a part of it.

1135
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:59,860
So at the start, it was quite literally, I said to the players, how do you want to play?

1136
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,900
Um, let's, let's scribble it down.

1137
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,800
Let's write it down.

1138
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,480
Um, and, uh, and they're not far off.

1139
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,420
They're smart guys.

1140
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:07,539
They know their footy.

1141
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,159
Um, and then, you know, asking, I guess then permission, which sounds like a silly thing

1142
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,260
to do, cause that's your job, right?

1143
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,800
I was like, oh, can we take that away?

1144
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,460
And as coaches, we'll come up with something and we'll come back to you and let's work

1145
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,739
through the language and, um, let's really sort of hone in what really sort of sits well

1146
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,260
with you.

1147
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,500
And, and so that's what we did.

1148
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:30,539
And as, as coaches, we went away, we formulated some plans, we formulated some principles.

1149
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,239
Um, we come back, we check with the group.

1150
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,940
What do you think?

1151
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,760
Yeah, we love it.

1152
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,760
We go back again.

1153
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:36,420
Okay.

1154
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,599
Can we put some structure in that?

1155
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,820
Can we put some roles around that?

1156
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,300
What roles would that look like?

1157
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,860
And then sort of your themes start to emerge out of that.

1158
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,780
Um, so I feel if you, if you can have that approach and the players can buy into it and

1159
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,840
they all own it, when you come back as a coach and say, hang on, didn't we all, it's not

1160
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,760
going, didn't we say we're all in on this?

1161
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,340
Um.

1162
00:38:55,699 --> 00:39:00,699
It has much more power and has much more meaning, um, rather than it's just the coach's idea

1163
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:04,039
and it's just the coaches that are running the schedule and we just follow what they

1164
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:04,360
do.

1165
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:09,039
Um, it's important to bring them along on the journey, but also what's really important

1166
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:14,460
is that using as many opportunities you can is to show or talk about your vision and,

1167
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,420
um, talk about what it should look like.

1168
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,579
Um, because I think we want that.

1169
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,639
We want to see what it looks like, but you also then, how is it relevant for what I'm

1170
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,840
doing right now in the moment today?

1171
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,519
Yeah.

1172
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,920
And that's what all the research says for us.

1173
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,840
If you co-create it with the team and they are in part of the process of determining

1174
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,780
their own vision, it's just so much more, but it sticks, doesn't it?

1175
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,039
Yeah.

1176
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,719
If you come in over the top and, and, and just, it's your words and not theirs.

1177
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,079
So.

1178
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,400
Yeah.

1179
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,340
I love that co-create.

1180
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,400
I love that co-create.

1181
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,960
And, and even just with the training environments, what we try to do is try and enable them to

1182
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,559
be able to, um, you know, problem solve and, um, have those conversations about what's

1183
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,559
working and what's not working and skill.

1184
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,619
Um, skill our leaders to be able to have those conversations because there's no, there's

1185
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,400
no stronger conversation than peer conversation and, um, and them getting on the same page.

1186
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,360
So we certainly haven't perfected that.

1187
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,260
We're nowhere near by any means the finished product on it, but, um, there are some of

1188
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,519
the things that actually are really important to us in our environment.

1189
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,000
And Vossi, I think that applies so much to every environment that I've ever been in.

1190
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,360
You think, you know, you're coaching Patrick Cripps, who's just an outstanding player and

1191
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,500
human, but to not think that he's a resource.

1192
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,699
You know, which wasn't in the past.

1193
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,099
It was hierarchical and there was no, what the coach didn't ask a play, even if he had

1194
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,119
300 games experience.

1195
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,000
And I think of that in work environments, we've got these highly skilled people who

1196
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,280
really know their craft or know their business really well, but the, the, the executive or

1197
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,400
the CEO doesn't engage their thoughts.

1198
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:43,920
It's disheartening, isn't it?

1199
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,760
You sort of don't feel like you belong in the environment.

1200
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,920
And it sounds like you're right on top of engaging the group in that way.

1201
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,059
So my curiosities are where we hear a lot of leaders like you.

1202
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,320
You know, through their, through curiosity, that's how they, they think about learning.

1203
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,159
Does that resonate with you?

1204
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,559
Oh, absolutely.

1205
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,699
Um, uh, not being fixated on the way that you learn, see things.

1206
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:12,039
Um, yeah, that's, that's extremely important when it comes to learning and being curious.

1207
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:17,900
And, um, if you're going to a course and you have a fixated mindset of the way things should

1208
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,599
be done, you really should be thinking about what you're actually doing there.

1209
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,219
Um, because you're, you're there to expand your skillsets.

1210
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:24,539
You're there.

1211
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,659
You're there to build more capacity.

1212
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,320
And, uh, um, and if you're closed minded off to that, well, then, you know, improvement

1213
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,199
will be extremely slow, extremely slow.

1214
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,539
Yeah.

1215
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:39,199
I mean, so that every day and you communicating with, with clarity, you know, something that

1216
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,079
big part of what you do day to day, if you, if you've got a, a strategy around the way

1217
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,960
you communicate, not real.

1218
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,980
I just think often and timely, um, you know, and, uh, you know, timely conversations.

1219
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,380
I think that's, uh, it's an underrated skillset to be able.

1220
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,239
To have timely conversations, you know, don't kick it down the road.

1221
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,699
Um, don't wait for another time, um, find the time to get it done.

1222
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,960
And, um, I think that that's exceptionally important.

1223
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,900
And, um, you know, when you, and, and the other thing is too, is that as players, and

1224
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,579
I know you'll appreciate this to us, it's just, you know, the honesty behind it.

1225
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:19,900
Um, it just be transparent and be honest and, um, and, and don't, you know, don't try and

1226
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,380
sell anything.

1227
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,719
You know, I just, it's not real.

1228
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,860
It doesn't feel authentic.

1229
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,619
Um.

1230
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,800
So I guess that's probably the two things, timely conversations and having honest conversations

1231
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,159
and, um, and just be prepared to have them, um, with as many people as you can.

1232
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,300
And, and out of that creates clarity.

1233
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:39,659
Um, also the other thing is, I don't think you can be afraid of is don't, don't be afraid

1234
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,780
that, um, having conversations that are a bit muddy.

1235
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,380
Uh, you know, a lot of our conversations with coaches and, and, and in behind the four walls

1236
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,800
is that we're, we're the ones that when it's a bit murky and it's a bit muddy and we're

1237
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,539
unpacking things and then take an hour.

1238
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,360
And a half to come up with the one thing that we actually want to come up with.

1239
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,820
That's a great conversation because while it might be a bit murky in here, um, by the

1240
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,820
time we walk out, it has to be crystal clear.

1241
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,380
So when we communicate back to the players, you know, it's clear for them.

1242
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,099
So it's understand.

1243
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:11,539
So we're trying to make complexity into simplicity.

1244
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:11,960
Yeah.

1245
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,920
Um, so if we don't make, if we make it complex when we walk out of the room or we're not

1246
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,880
on the same page, gee, that can create some issues and certainly more issues than what

1247
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,480
it's worth.

1248
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,920
Um.

1249
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,480
If you just spend 10 extra minutes.

1250
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,340
10 minutes in that room to be able to get the clarity that you actually need.

1251
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:27,739
Yeah.

1252
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,639
I love the way you pitch that.

1253
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,739
Just communicate often and do it, you know, authentically and, and, uh, and sincerely.

1254
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:37,260
It's a, it's a pretty, uh, good path to follow.

1255
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,880
Collaborating, Rossi, how important has that been for you now as a leader?

1256
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,059
I think that would be one of the main things I feel like I've changed, um, or has evolved

1257
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,320
over time, um, is literally that word collaboration.

1258
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,000
Um, the other.

1259
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,539
You know, the, the collaboration piece is that when we integrate within our programs,

1260
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:04,739
having welfare come together and development come together and line coaches coming together

1261
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:07,840
and collaborate together on what we want that program to look like.

1262
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,739
And we don't have people sitting in silos and they're off running their own program

1263
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:14,619
and we've got our, they've got their own program.

1264
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,699
All it ends up happening is the end user for us is the player.

1265
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,880
And what happens is, is that within the program, everything just duplicates.

1266
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,519
Um, and then the feedback you get from the player.

1267
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,099
So, geez, there's a lot in the program.

1268
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,820
Um, whereas if you can, if you can co-create, as you said, and you can sort of integrate

1269
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,820
and you can collaborate, um, your programs, I think they're effective.

1270
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,000
They are time, it's time consuming, um, to be able to come up with what that looks like.

1271
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:44,599
But, um, again, I think you get paid back, um, with the players because it's time efficient.

1272
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,880
You're much more productive.

1273
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,260
Um, it's much more purposeful in, and you have just greater intent in, in what you're

1274
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:51,719
trying to do.

1275
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:54,340
And then often, you know, in footy clubs and artwork.

1276
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,719
And well, those silos can then become negative and become resentful because they're not being

1277
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,739
collaborated with different narratives come out of that.

1278
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,679
And that's where you sort of, that foundation's a discontent, aren't you?

1279
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:09,840
If you don't do it with all the things that you're saying at one, you know, you're not

1280
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,420
going to be effective, but two can be the reverse of that too, can't it?

1281
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,179
It can get pretty toxic.

1282
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,159
Yeah, absolutely.

1283
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,900
And, and there's some, um, there's some struggle to through to get it to, to as efficient as

1284
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,619
you want it, but it's a, it's a worthwhile, it's worthwhile cause to chase.

1285
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,340
Um, but the collaboration.

1286
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,179
The collaboration piece, uh, I think that's, you know, a lot of people talk about connection.

1287
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,500
I reckon that's been a really big change in the last, probably 10 years.

1288
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,900
I'd say the other one has been collaboration, um, and how you get the departments not, not

1289
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,500
only just deliver what they need to be able to do, but how do you work together?

1290
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:41,820
And, and it's also with players.

1291
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,880
So we just talked about how we co-create a game style.

1292
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,380
Well, it's collaborating with them on the way you want to play.

1293
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,599
Um, so you have that shared purpose.

1294
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,340
And if you can get that shared purpose and it has really great clarity, well, hopefully

1295
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,219
never guarantees the success, but hopefully it gives you a greater percentage chance of

1296
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,059
being able to do so.

1297
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,400
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1298
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:03,880
Oh, my dad.

1299
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,760
Uh, that seems like a really obvious thing to say.

1300
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,139
I think what I've been really blessed with, Dars, is that in different stages of my life,

1301
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:14,860
I feel like I've been surrounded by leaders.

1302
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,320
Um, and whether I've naturally gravitated to it, I'm not sure, but even as a young fellow

1303
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,579
being at the Morningside Football Club, um, I had a guy called, uh, who was the captain

1304
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:27,840
of the Morningside Football Club named Daryl Burke.

1305
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:34,699
And, um, and Berkey for some reason took a sort of, uh, an interest in me and he gave

1306
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:37,480
him my first brand new Sherin.

1307
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,780
So I had a Sherin, but it was that old one kicked on the road a hundred times that was

1308
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,260
brown and it lost all its color.

1309
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:48,440
And, um, the laces were starting to come off and cause it had been kicked endlessly between

1310
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,199
me and my brother.

1311
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,179
And he walked up to me one day and he handed...

1312
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,900
He handed me my first Sherin.

1313
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,699
And, uh, and I remember picking it up and then I smelled it for the first time.

1314
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,599
It's just that unbelievable smell that I'll never forget.

1315
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,039
We all love that smell, don't we, mate?

1316
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,619
I used to sleep with one when I was a kid.

1317
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,239
It's, it's hard.

1318
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,539
Yeah.

1319
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,579
So he gave me it to me and he said, mate, um, what I want you to do is, he said, you

1320
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,239
can have this Sherin.

1321
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,780
I've gone, I'm looking at him going, are you telling, are you joking me?

1322
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,500
And he goes, mate, I'm going to give you this Sherin.

1323
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:17,360
He said, but what I want you to do is you've got to learn how to spin it on, on, on your

1324
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,619
finger.

1325
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:21,199
And I'm guessing the message out of it was.

1326
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,280
So him was like, mate, touch the footy, have the footy in your hands all the time.

1327
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,699
So I just went away and I was like, oh, mate, unreal.

1328
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,460
So I was just like trying to spin the ball and trying to do all these things.

1329
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,239
So the fact that he has actually influenced me, um, and just by reaching out and showing

1330
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:35,940
an interest, that was really profound for me.

1331
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,099
Um, you know, I had Roger Merritt who went there and we weren't as good as we probably

1332
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,699
could have been at the bears at the time, but he was just a really strong leader for

1333
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,480
me and scared the bejeebers out of me and everybody else.

1334
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,300
Um, he was, he was exceptional.

1335
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:57,480
Um, Lee Matthews, um, was just a, probably the person that taught me how to be a leader.

1336
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,940
If you want to sort of converting the talent into hopefully something as a leader, he was

1337
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,599
a leader of men.

1338
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,900
Um, so he, he was, he was exceptional in that, but it was always in the background was my

1339
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:15,139
dad and, um, my dad helped me out and teaching me about, you know, the values of life and

1340
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:17,119
what was important and wasn't, what was important.

1341
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,239
And, uh, without him, I certainly wouldn't achieve what I, uh, where I've got to.

1342
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
Yeah.

1343
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
I would have brilliant answer.

1344
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,320
I love, I love it.

1345
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,780
No hesitation on your dad, but then to, as you said, they're good fortune, isn't it?

1346
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,679
If you have few people in your life along the way that, that clearly set you on a pretty

1347
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:33,679
amazing path.

1348
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,559
It's a, I'm a, I'm glad you got the chance to, to acknowledge them then I'm, I'm sure

1349
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:38,559
you would have done it before.

1350
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,980
Um, you know, in the, in the spirit of collaboration, I like asking this question and you know,

1351
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,980
you've got other interests as well, so it may be footy related, but if you can collaborate

1352
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,880
with anyone on, on anything, is there a name that springs to mind?

1353
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Have you?

1354
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,639
No, it doesn't actually, um, no, I don't, I don't think it stands out.

1355
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:00,639
Um, no, I don't think it stands out to us.

1356
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:01,639
I'll keep searching.

1357
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,599
I'll put, there'll be an obvious thing when we walk away from this, so I can't believe

1358
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,599
I didn't say that, but.

1359
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,599
You'll think of it in the car and you can ring me back.

1360
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,599
No, no.

1361
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,760
It's a, you know, I think that, as you said, your world's diverse, but, um, there's a pretty

1362
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,440
clear goal that you've got at the moment, isn't it, to, to bring that success back to

1363
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
the environment you're in.

1364
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,880
Is it, is it sort of feel like, um, when you wake up every day.

1365
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
Yeah.

1366
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,880
You know what you're up for?

1367
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
Yeah.

1368
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,579
I'm reminded every day, I, you know, sort of even last year and what we, what we did

1369
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,639
last year and then how it finished, it's, um, you know, I still think about that a lot.

1370
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,039
Um, but it reminds me every day what I'm doing here and, um, you know, the purpose is really

1371
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:45,119
clear for me and, uh, you know, and it's, uh, it's, it's extremely exciting opportunity,

1372
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,880
um, you know, to be able to sort of leading the, the, the Carlton football club.

1373
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
I was, uh, you know, when I was a kid.

1374
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,880
There was, there was, you know, my pop and me and we'd follow Carlton and everyone, the

1375
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
rest of my family was pretty much Richmond.

1376
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,519
Um, but pop got me under the wing and said, no, son, you're with me.

1377
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:04,380
And, uh, so I remember watching the blue baggers, um, you know, from a very young age.

1378
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,920
And, um, so to go full circle on that and then be back here, who are the players in

1379
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,119
your use that, uh, yeah, that's easy.
