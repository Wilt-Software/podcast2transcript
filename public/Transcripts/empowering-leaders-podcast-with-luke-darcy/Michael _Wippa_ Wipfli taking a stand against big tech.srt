00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:12,380
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is broadcasting legend, multi-award winning radio presenter and comedian Michael Whipper-Whipfley.

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,280
Whipper is a great champion of using his platform and microphone for good.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:27,280
And in most recent times, the 36-month campaign to increase the age when children are legally able to use social media from 13 to 16.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:36,060
Whipper talks with me about his own battle with severe mental health that gave him an insight into the despair that he feels kids are facing when they're online.

5
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,320
The importance of giving those 36 months from 13 to 16 back to our children while their brains develop.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,640
And how his own nine-year-old is already talking about wanting to use Snapchat.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,320
The alarming impact social media is having on education.

8
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,320
And Whipper throws down a challenge to the Prime Minister, who he's already had in his studio.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,259
And the opposition leader, Peter Dutton.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,359
To make the decision now to stop allowing harm to children the same way that we did with seatbelt laws back in the day.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,780
It's people like Whipper who inspire the work we do at Alita.

Huge thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

17
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,260
A great leader.

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,939
Understand the importance of sleep.

19
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,299
And Temper is a mattress like no other.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,200
NASA approved.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
It's the world's best in bedding.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,159
Have a look at Temper today.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,780
Michael Whipper Whipfley is a multi-award winning radio presenter and comedian who has used his microphone for good over many years.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:55,540
Supporting and raising thousands of dollars for youth-related charities across Australia, including Ronald McDonald House, Little Wings Flight Service, Cooper Rich Braiding Foundation for sarcoma research,

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,260
and BATTA for youth mental health.

26
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,299
To name a few.

27
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:06,459
Whipper has launched a campaign to change legislation to increase the age when children are legally able to use social media from 13 to 16.

28
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,300
He partnered with Finch CEO Rob Galuzzo to create the initiative 36 Months.

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:21,199
And he's using the platform of his radio show, which has already seen the campaign receive verbal support from the New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,219
Whipper, I've been a great admirer and fan of yours for a long period of time.

31
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,139
Congratulations on all that you're doing.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,219
Thanks, Duff.

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,659
We're having a swing, mate.

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060
I mean, there's no other way to do it.

35
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,300
You've done a lot of breakfast shows as well, so a lot of years behind the microphone.

36
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:47,379
So you do have moments between sort of running competitions like Beat the Bomb and The Fugitive and giving away Taylor Swift tickets where you think, hang on a minute, this thing talks to all these people.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,819
What can we do with it?

38
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:56,259
What should we be doing with this thing outside of what's your favourite Chinese dish and should there be pineapple on pizza?

39
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,240
You've done them all, Duff.

40
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,180
You've done them all.

41
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,139
I want to say 1-3-3-3-5-3.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,699
Give us a call when you said, oh, I've got a bit of muscle memory back, Whipper.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,919
But in fairness to you, mate, not everyone thinks the way you do.

44
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,539
People think this is a great gig.

45
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,639
You get paid well.

46
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:22,319
You and Fitzy, you know, you work with great people and Kate Ritchie's joined your show and you get free stuff and you're home three hours later and life's good.

47
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,020
Not everyone's got a social conscience like you.

48
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,240
Has that always been?

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Has it always been part of the way you've been or is it something you felt the responsibility of?

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,159
Great question because I do think about this a little bit.

51
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:54,879
And I think, as you know, in this job and when you're in the media or any level of celebrity, I suppose, you kind of become the more your profile grows, the more demand there is for you to be involved in different things, different organisations, be it a charity or a favour to help out or emceeing an event to raise money.

52
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:03,879
And you kind of, I suppose, you're exposed to more things, you're exposed to more stories, you're exposed to the organisations that might need a little bit of help.

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:13,439
And when you seize and hear about some things that go on, I think it comes with the charity as well and becoming a parent, you sit back and think, well, what can I do?

54
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,960
Because that doesn't seem right.

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,500
So how can I get involved?

56
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,660
And I think as we all grow up, we sort of seek more in our life than just the output of what we do on a daily basis.

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,759
It's that question of what?

58
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,899
What else can we do?

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:40,060
When you think about the audience that we have out there and then you look at some of the things that go on and at the same time, Darcy, you'd know through radio, you're very lucky to meet a lot of people and your circle widens very quickly.

60
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,779
You would have known that through footy as well.

61
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:52,779
So all of a sudden you've got this handful of great people that are in powerful positions or with great profile and then you stumble across a need that desires and requires a change.

62
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,720
And you think, hang on, I've got all these pieces.

63
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,540
If I bought them all in, we might be able to do something really special here.

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,439
I think that's what we've landed on here.

65
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,199
And again, I've got so much admiration for you, Whipper.

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,779
Not many people can get the prime minister to come into their studio and the premier of your state and then actually launch a campaign.

67
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,319
And is this in part, I mean, you've been really open yourself about having some mental health struggles and reading more of that.

68
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,180
I didn't quite understand the gravitas.

69
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,639
I think you've shared that almost to the point staring at a balcony and looking at potentially ending it.

70
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,899
Has that driven this purpose for you around wanting to make a difference, given the nature of how bad the issues with social media are?

71
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,699
Can you share with us a bit of your background and what got you to that point?

72
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,360
Yeah, I mean, I was doing it tough and I think it was a process of growing up.

73
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,180
There'd been sort of a trigger pulled through personal life, which sort of sent me spiralling.

74
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,139
But I got to a point where it was extremely scary to be there.

75
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,519
And I think you kind of dip your toe in that.

76
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,680
And when you realise we...

77
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:02,060
When you're out at that moment in time, if you're lucky enough to come back and, you know, hopefully you've got a good team around you, if you find yourself in that position.

78
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,839
And there's obviously a lot of services you can call if you do find yourself there.

79
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,120
But I think that plays a part in it because I think about other people that might be in that situation where they think, you know, what would it be easier if I'm not here?

80
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,660
Well, there's a hell of a lot of people around you saying that's the wrong way of thinking.

81
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,220
That's where you've ended up.

82
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,160
But you need it and you want it and you're loved.

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,279
So you must be here.

84
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,279
So when I think about people that possibly...

85
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,519
And through a lot of adolescent brains and social media influence, kids are finding themselves in that position.

86
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,319
And, you know, I'm not dramatic by saying kids are killing themselves because that can be the result.

87
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:49,360
So it does make me very, very aware and I'm very conscious of the mindset some of those kids might find themselves in.

88
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,779
And that scares me like it scared me back in the day.

89
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,779
And with Birgit.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:05,600
I use admiration because, you know, you're maybe a generation slightly behind me, but we weren't necessarily courageous enough to share those things the way that you have done so openly.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:15,579
And that allows when you see Whipper, he's got this great life and he's living the rock star life and he's funny and everything's going great to say, hey, I could get to that place.

92
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,839
And it doesn't discriminate for you to be able to use your profile again to courageously share that.

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,579
Was that a hard thing to do or did it take you a while to get there?

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah, it did.

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:35,199
It took me a long time, to be honest, because I think you're always once you've had sort of that experience and you've found yourself pretty low, you're always processing it.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,100
I think you're always looking back on it and trying to understand how you ended up there.

97
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,120
But at the same time, you're looking for education.

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,759
So you know that if you found yourself heading down that path again, what sort of things can you do?

99
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,699
And I've had moments since then where I've started to feel like that.

100
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,720
And I bring in a routine which helps pull me out of that.

101
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,759
It's not always going to be the solution for every position that I find myself in or for other people.

102
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,199
But it's going back to basics.

103
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,759
It's exercise every day.

104
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,439
Exercise is unbelievable.

105
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,079
And you don't need to be doing some sort of preseason workout.

106
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,720
You can just go for a walk, get off the grog, plenty of water and just get the basics right.

107
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,139
And consider all the little things that you've done that day, which are the basics.

108
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,600
To be big wins, they're success stories in your day.

109
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,620
So the fact that you managed to get yourself out of bed and have a shower that day and maybe you didn't the day before, that is a win.

110
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,639
Write that down as a successful move.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,799
And each day it's like lying, it was described to me once like lying in water, where every now and then you lift your head out of the water and you take a breath and you go back down.

112
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,919
And then the next day you take two breaths out of the water and all of a sudden you don't want to be in the water anymore and you can pull yourself out of that.

113
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,679
And I encourage anybody that might find themselves in that position.

114
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,159
Just to get back to the basics.

115
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,980
Make sure you walk, water, sleep, do the basics.

116
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,659
That advice, Whipper, isn't it?

117
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:07,419
I think anyone, it's a spectrum, isn't it, for all of us around having some degree of mental health.

118
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,759
It's a continuum, isn't it?

119
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:19,899
And all of us, someone said to me once, you know, you go and take a truckload of drugs, don't sleep for three and a half days, and then you're a chance to be almost at the end.

120
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,159
Life is this thin wedge.

121
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,379
And we're all dancing on the edge of it.

122
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,559
As you said, you get up, you do your morning routine, you exercise, you drink water, you eat.

123
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,039
You feel bulletproof, but you can let that go without even understanding it, can't you?

124
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,100
And suddenly you feel yourself.

125
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,059
It slides really quickly.

126
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,059
Amazing, isn't it?

127
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,340
Yeah, but you know what?

128
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:49,500
The other part of me coming out and talking about it too was when I saw more and more people, the reaction I would get, I mean, to see Paul Gallen come out and talk about his battle.

129
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,519
And I thought, Paul Gallen, that guy's tough as nails.

130
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,500
You know, there's no weakness in talking about that.

131
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:04,480
So every time I would see somebody that I admired or looked up to, a professional in the field talk about it, I suppose I reacted by how it made me feel.

132
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:12,559
And me telling my story is the hope that I could get that reaction from somebody else that might be listening that possibly enjoys the radio show.

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,879
And we're in the midst of what is irrefutably a mental health crisis.

134
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,940
And now it's irrefutably linked to the perils of social media for our youth.

135
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah.

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah.

137
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,120
Yeah.

138
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,159
Yeah.

139
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,220
Yeah.

140
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,240
Yeah.

141
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,259
Yeah.

142
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah.

143
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,080
Unbelievable spikes in eating disorders, particularly in young teenage girls.

144
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,460
Some of the stats are horrific.

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,340
Anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide in Australia and around the globe are at record levels.

146
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,759
The link is directly to the algorithms that our kids look at on their phones, the unrealistic imagery that's there.

147
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,220
How big a problem is it from the work that you've done to research it?

148
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,940
You know, I was talking to a dad last night and the plan was to get him on the radio show.

149
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,240
And we didn't because it just didn't work.

150
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
Because it just didn't feel right.

151
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,700
Because it was just, it was far too, far too confronting what he's had to go through.

152
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,740
He lost his daughter through the online bullying he received through one of the social media platforms.

153
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,940
And he said he lives every day now as if he is numb.

154
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,879
He says he has a son.

155
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,539
So he said, I have something to live for.

156
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:20,340
But at the same time, I'm completely numb and there is nothing that brings him happiness.

157
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,120
I mean, that's from the dad's point.

158
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:37,259
What scares me even more is to think of the mindset and the feeling that his daughter must have had and how long it went on for and how long it took for her to come to a point where she felt she was in a situation where there was no way back.

159
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:46,639
And since putting my hand up, and as I've said, Darsen, why I'm so grateful for coming on the show, like you, I'm saying we've got a problem here, guys.

160
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,039
So I'm representing the parents and the teachers.

161
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,139
I'm representing anybody that thinks this simply.

162
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
It doesn't make sense.

163
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,519
Imagine if there was another product out there, Darsen, call it a bloody shampoo.

164
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:06,759
And one out of two kids that used the shampoo ended up with some sort of psychological impact, anxiety or depression.

165
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,799
But in extreme cases, if you kept using the shampoo, you could end up dead.

166
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,059
Well, that product wouldn't be on the store for more than five seconds.

167
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,080
That would be gone.

168
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,759
And that's what we're dealing with.

169
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,740
And nobody is putting a stop to it.

170
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,220
And I just don't.

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,159
I don't understand it.

172
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,259
And, you know, from a parent's point of view, Darsen, with three kids, as you know, you want to be able to parent.

173
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:43,700
And the parents are being stripped of having any impact or involvement or being able to advise or even prepare and arm their kids with any skills because the greatest influence is coming from some smart algorithm.

174
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,139
It's crazy, isn't it?

175
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,820
I mean, the data's next level.

176
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,059
70% of teens have had a negative experience online in the last week.

177
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,220
One in three have been exposed.

178
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,960
Two disturbing or traumatic content.

179
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,399
One in four have been cyber bullied or sexually harassed in social media.

180
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,980
You've really drilled into something that seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?

181
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,299
Raising the age limit.

182
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,200
It's not a hard thing from 13 to 16.

183
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,379
So the campaign's called 36 Months.

184
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,679
Can you tell us why you're focused in on that and why those 36 months count so much?

185
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,539
I'm not trying to stop Instagram.

186
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,539
I'm saying that the impact on adolescent brains between 13...

187
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:37,019
...and 16, or even younger if we can, but my understanding of the platform as far as the law goes here in Australia, and it's a law that's sort of extended from America under their Parental Act from 1998, says that if you're 13, you can land on one of these platforms.

188
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,919
So, yes, the 36 months is that adolescent brain period of development.

189
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,200
And, you know, if I had it my way, it'd be 18.

190
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,899
But, you know, that might be a stretch too far.

191
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,139
So the other thing with the 36 months is...

192
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:10,440
You've got to think, if we can give that back to the kids and families can reconnect, imagine the teaching and the skills we can put in place over those three years, three crucial years, so when a kid reaches the age of 16 and decides they want to be on social media, that they have the skills to handle what might be thrown at them.

193
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,399
So the curriculum around what can be built in to the 36 months is exciting to think about.

194
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,139
You know, you can come back to the family.

195
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,440
You know, one of the taglines we've been using, Darcy, is...

196
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,399
You know, 36 months to get to know yourself before the rest of the world does.

197
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,600
You know, who knows who they are at the age of 13?

198
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,759
It's madness.

199
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,679
It's insane, isn't it?

200
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,179
You know, as a father of four, it's the biggest issue that you think about every day.

201
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,399
And I'm sure you're in that same bracket of just this new territory that no one really understood previously.

202
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,559
But now you understand what these platforms are doing.

203
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,679
There's a great book.

204
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,220
Johan Hari wrote a book about stolen folk.

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,980
And, you know, at the extreme end, we're losing kids to suicide.

206
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,179
And that's happening daily.

207
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,340
And the eating disorder crisis is out of control and the mental health and the anxiety.

208
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:16,039
But just from an ability to actually think and evolve and be a better person, we're all subjected to these 20-second clips of our life that are reducing us to sort of, you know, domesticated cats almost in our ability to focus.

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,379
How do you think about it as your kids are growing up?

210
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,759
It's the fight I have every day.

211
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,159
I had it this morning with a toy.

212
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,399
They get up, they exercise.

213
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:24,740
They're pretty competitive.

214
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,159
It's like, boys, off the phones.

215
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,580
We're not allowed to have them in the mornings.

216
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,659
At nighttime, we'll get them in a separate room.

217
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,559
That room's locked.

218
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,500
It's a full-time job.

219
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,120
As you said, we're fighting against the legislation.

220
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,639
You're trying to help at the legislative point of view.

221
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
But as a parent, how do you think about it?

222
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,179
I mean, Ted's nine years old, my oldest, and he's already talking about Snapchat.

223
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:49,100
And as a parent also, they are in a position where they continue to find themselves powerless.

224
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,620
And a lot of the feedback is, it's the bloody parents' fault.

225
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,120
They should be able to do something.

226
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,860
Well, they don't because they don't want to create social isolation for their kid at school

227
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,919
who comes home and says, everybody else is on it.

228
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,720
Everybody else is doing it.

229
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:08,120
You know, that's so the problem we have is the pressure on the kid to join it because everybody else is doing it.

230
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,259
And then the pressure on the parent who wants to try and be a parent that's encouraging of their kid for whatever everybody else is doing.

231
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,299
So we can remove that pressure from the kid and we can remove it from the parent as well.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
I think in a situation like that.

233
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,440
And looking at the laws that they have last night, my understanding is it goes through at the moment,

234
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:33,919
if you talk about the age of 13 on some of the platforms that we have through our e-safety commissioner,

235
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,039
we have a way where the social media platform can be fined if we were to dob in somebody under the age of 13.

236
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,559
You can go down that path.

237
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,659
So I think if we were able to change the law, I think the platforms would evolve accordingly

238
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:51,000
because these fines could be racked up.

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,559
But very quickly, if they were to be enforced, they already exist.

240
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
They just need adjusting.

241
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,279
So that's one thing we could do.

242
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:06,440
If it's the fact that someone listens to this podcast does and it opens their eyes and ears to what the effects of what social media are,

243
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,519
that's a win as well.

244
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,160
So there's many layers of how we can win here.

245
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,799
But having this conversation is such a big part of it.

246
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,400
And when you look at the states, you know, state by state, and they're very different laws over there in the US

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,900
because there's different privacy acts, but there's also the freedom of speech.

248
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,240
All this sort of stuff.

249
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,619
They talk about the addictive features of social media,

250
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,660
the different features that are made to keep you on there for as long as possible.

251
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,980
The infinite scroll, the likes, the shares.

252
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,859
I mean, the guy I spoke to who lost his daughter,

253
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,000
to think that she's on that platform effectively ranking herself socially

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,819
and then she goes to bed feeling as a failure,

255
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,180
wakes up to see what the impact of maybe her post has had,

256
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,579
so starts her day feeling as a failure.

257
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah.

258
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,420
And then goes to school and it continues on and on.

259
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,019
So that's where we're at.

260
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,000
You know, if we could remove, and I think the fight in the US has been about these addictive features,

261
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,099
like the infinite scroll, if we can come down hard on that,

262
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,160
then there's some creative platforms which are great.

263
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:11,799
YouTube's an interesting one.

264
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,819
I mean, people have said, but what about YouTube and social media?

265
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:20,579
Well, it's described as a social media because it has social media,

266
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,980
but it's also described by YouTube as being a search engine

267
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,539
because there's so much content on there.

268
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,099
And there's young kids on there that are creating fantastic content

269
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,880
and little businesses and little entrepreneurs.

270
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,220
And to that I say, fantastic.

271
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,740
Do it with your mum or dad.

272
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:37,940
That's great.

273
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,279
They can set you up.

274
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,660
They can help you through your business.

275
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,799
Do it together.

276
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,380
We're not trying to stop that.

277
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,960
Whipper, I'd love to introduce you to a remarkable lady called Zoe Kalar.

278
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,559
You might have heard of WeAre8, which is a tech platform,

279
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,599
social media for good.

280
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,059
This is a brilliant story,

281
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,819
and we want to fill you with some positivity in this conversation today.

282
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,859
She's a serial success story in the tech entrepreneurial world.

283
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,980
She created an app that understood where the money goes.

284
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,799
Mark Zuckerberg takes $140 billion a year out of the advertising pool,

285
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,519
going to one person effective.

286
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,539
You can't – it's $10 billion every three weeks.

287
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,539
He could turn off those algorithms of hate in a nanosecond.

288
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,559
Billion.

289
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,920
Every three weeks.

290
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,519
Every three weeks, but won't do it because they want you on that platform longer,

291
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,839
and the more negative things are, our brains are wired to hard.

292
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,339
We continue to look at it, and they just pump as many ads in front of you as they can,

293
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,059
and that model needs to be disrupted.

294
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,359
And WeAre8 is being supported by some of the great athletes and investors around the world.

295
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,819
Pat Cummings and Rio Ferdinand are great champions of it, and it's zero hate.

296
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,440
It is the AI ability.

297
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,339
You can't be fake.

298
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,599
You've got to turn up as yourself, which really reduces the trolling by about 95%.

299
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,720
So there's hope, isn't there, Whipper, that we can include legislation like you're fighting for,

300
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,099
and then as a community, putting some of that money back into the hands of the users themselves

301
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,539
and to charity and to good rather than to some guy who wants to be a UFC fighter

302
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,720
building an island for $50 billion.

303
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,940
Doing whatever he's doing over there, Whipper, is a bit scary, isn't it?

304
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,339
Do you know the other scary thing to think about in this world where money talks is that,

305
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,599
you know, some people have said, well, you're not going to have an impact until it becomes a commercial thing, right?

306
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,579
Until it's money-based, then there's really not going to be any change.

307
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,960
Well, the other thing the government needs to think about,

308
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,400
and some of the teacher friends that I've spoken to in schools is they can't teach anymore

309
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,920
because their entire day is putting out fires that have been created via chat groups on social media.

310
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,579
So, therefore, teachers are leaving in their droves.

311
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,200
So, all of a sudden, now we have a commercial issue because teachers are already underpaid.

312
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,279
They're stressed.

313
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,740
And now they're unable to do their job.

314
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,200
So, what's the point?

315
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,059
So, you know, in one school in particular, they've had three or four teachers leave because of this.

316
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,180
And in an alarming alignment with that, at the same school,

317
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,460
there was 70% of the girls at the school had been involved in self-harm.

318
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,380
So, what the hell is going on here?

319
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,279
And you have to actually get your head around the numbers to reinforce that again.

320
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,960
The end of the lockdown period here in Melbourne, there were 600 new diagnoses a week in Melbourne alone,

321
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,420
600 a week of eating disorders of young girls.

322
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,559
So, the perfect storm of taking them out, training them onto their screens,

323
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,779
sitting on social media, new cases of eating disorders.

324
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,539
No one wants to talk about that is exactly what is happening.

325
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:44,700
And we know the devastation of that on families and where it leads to.

326
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:50,380
But I, as I said, I'm a fan of everything that you do and using your platform for good.

327
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,819
And I love these conversations because I see you as a great leadership story.

328
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:58,559
I've sat in that same chair before and you don't always have to use your platform for good,

329
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,920
but you do that in a great way.

330
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,000
And we love the saying, success leaves clues.

331
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:06,500
And every person who is a great leadership story, I love asking these handful of questions with us.

332
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,119
I'll fire them your way.

333
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,799
And we feel like it's hard to lead someone else unless you've got a sense of self-leadership yourself.

334
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,759
Does that resonate with you?

335
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:15,859
Yeah, it does.

336
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:16,700
It does.

337
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:20,200
But, you know, for a lot of it too, I think you've got to be brave.

338
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,319
I think you don't go out and say, I'm going to be successful.

339
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:24,279
Do you?

340
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,059
You don't go, oh, mate, I read this book and I tell you what, I've gone through the checklist.

341
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,579
Number one, come up with a social initiative.

342
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,980
Okay, here we go.

343
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,599
But there's part of you, I think you're just driven to do that.

344
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,579
I think you're driven when you see it and when you feel it and when you hear it.

345
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:46,079
So, but I would be absolutely honoured if someone was to look at what I'm doing and what we're attempting to do on behalf of everybody

346
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,900
and be inspired to do something similar themselves.

347
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,880
We see that people who do have an impact are really conscious of being positive

348
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,259
and impacting people in their environment in a positive way from a daily basis to what you're doing,

349
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,000
which is changing legislation at a national level.

350
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:07,140
Do you think about that impact every day of having a positive impact on others?

351
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,740
Do you know, sometimes I don't think about it every day, but sometimes you're beautifully reminded.

352
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,079
I mean, we were talking, I went to Officeworks the other day and a bloke pulled up behind me in a truck.

353
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,880
And he goes, oh, you're bloody.

354
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,500
You're a whipper, aren't you?

355
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,900
I'll get you confused for Mick Malloy.

356
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,220
And I went, oh, not the first time, mate.

357
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
And I love you on the back page.

358
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,319
I love you on bloody the front part.

359
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,319
I go, that's not me, mate.

360
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,440
Anyway, anyway, he's got 10 years on me.

361
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:38,380
And this guy said, I just want to let you know, I've been through a divorce recently.

362
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,460
And when I drive to work, I'm just, I'm beaten up.

363
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't want to go to work.

364
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,640
I'm not interested in my relationships falling apart.

365
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,619
And then I find myself having a bit of a laugh with you and Fitzy.

366
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:54,680
And I think those are the moments where you're reminded of what you're doing, because you know what it's like.

367
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,339
You can sit in the studio and your heart rate doesn't lift.

368
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,900
You're so comfortable and you're enjoying yourself, but you kind of, you're lost in the moment.

369
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,200
But when someone stops you and just reminds you of what you're doing, but I've learned the hard way too, Darce.

370
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,319
I've said the wrong thing and have someone call me an idiot at the same time.

371
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,480
So it kind of goes both ways.

372
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,480
But now that I've kind of knocked a bit of the idiot out, I'm trying to smarten it up a little bit and hope that I can make

373
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,440
some positive change.

374
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,759
You're doing that in a profound way.

375
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,519
And it's a pretty big vision that you've got, isn't it?

376
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,059
To take the prime minister in your studio and say, we need to change this.

377
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,279
It's a serious vision.

378
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,920
We see people who do that have thought about the way they're going to share a vision of that scale.

379
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,519
Did you go into that?

380
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,559
How do you think about sharing this vision to change the legislation the way you have?

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,059
With the PM, right?

382
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,420
I reckon whether you're a Dutton fan or you're with Albanese, I think for both of them,

383
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:55,599
you've got a real opportunity here to become a true world leader where you can actually have a major change.

384
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:04,079
And I'll tell you what, this topic is hot in every country and slowly, state by state in the US, you see it and other states and other countries will pull the trigger.

385
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,180
But imagine being able to hang your hat on it.

386
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:16,440
I mean, and that's why I talk and I don't get me wrong, I'm being a bit cheeky and I'm shooting from the hip here when I say, if you made this an election promise, then you would win the vote of every Australian parent.

387
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,599
Now, maybe it's not.

388
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:16,720
I don't know.

389
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:16,779
I don't know.

390
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:16,839
I don't know.

391
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:16,880
I don't know.

392
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,140
I don't know.

393
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,180
I don't know.

394
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,240
I don't know.

395
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,279
I don't know.

396
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,380
I don't know.

397
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,400
I don't know.

398
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,420
I don't know.

399
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:25,960
I know, you know, whatever side I vote for, I would definitely jump on that ship if that was on the table out of concern for my kids.

400
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:29,799
The one thing you love more and care about more than anything else on this planet.

401
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,700
So I'm cheeky when I say that and I understand it.

402
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,980
But at the same time, I think they need a nudge and I think they can also see the opportunity.

403
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,180
So it's fantastic that Albo came out and said, I love that you're doing this.

404
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,240
We see the importance of this and then put some money into some research into tech.

405
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,400
And verification, which is great.

406
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
But you know what?

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,779
You can actually make that call.

408
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,960
You're the most powerful man in the country and you can pull the trigger on that.

409
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,220
So if we make enough noise, I mean, the prime minister works for us, does.

410
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:03,759
Does.

411
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:04,619
You realize that?

412
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,359
He works for us, you and me and anybody else listening.

413
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,160
So we need to remind him of what's important to us.

414
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,519
We're going to tell him what we need so he can lead and implement.

415
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,220
So we just need to remind him.

416
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,519
That's what he needs to do for us.

417
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,000
And I think you've thrown that challenge down nicely.

418
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,680
It's right when election cycles come around really quickly.

419
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,200
I think this is a thing that almost unites every parent.

420
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,859
No one thinks this is a good thing.

421
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,400
And we all need help because, as you said, if you're the only parent removing social

422
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,000
media from your kid, they are going to be the outlier.

423
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,099
We need, this is where governments can do good and do it easily and have no negative

424
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,480
effect.

425
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,380
There is no downside.

426
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,240
What advantage is there to giving a kid social media at 13?

427
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,339
There is no upside.

428
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:52,019
And we now know irrefutably we're actually harming and losing children as a result of

429
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:52,160
it.

430
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
So that doesn't make sense.

431
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,519
No, it just doesn't make any sense.

432
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,400
That's the other thing.

433
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,240
And I'm sure a lot of parents do.

434
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,500
They'd be going mad when they think, let's just, I mean, let's run the pub test over

435
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,859
this.

436
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:08,539
And I can't understand why we're okay with that.

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,839
And, you know, there was a great quote the other day that we will look back and think,

438
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,180
what were we doing?

439
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,319
What were we doing to our kids?

440
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:21,940
Did you know that back in the day, there weren't seatbelts in the car and you could

441
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,720
drink as much as you want and drive?

442
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,839
You're all kidding.

443
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,000
Who would do that?

444
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:26,740
They did.

445
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,839
They did.

446
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,799
I used to sit on my dad's lap and steer the wheel back in the day.

447
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,980
Johnny Whipfley used to get behind the wheel and he knew he was going straight because

448
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,200
he could feel the tram lines under the tyres.

449
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,599
Not that long ago, Whipper, is it?

450
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:42,400
I know.

451
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,720
And people don't understand it.

452
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,700
It was illegal to be gay.

453
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:46,759
No, I know.

454
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,240
What are you talking about?

455
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:48,980
Crazy.

456
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:53,440
So I feel like we have all this data that's been collected over the past 10 years or so.

457
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,880
And now we're in a position to be able to present it.

458
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,460
Let's not, let's not stretch this set of data required.

459
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,640
We don't need any more.

460
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,099
It's all on the table and it's all in front of us.

461
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,359
So let's not consider this trial period of what we're doing to kids to go any longer.

462
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:13,420
Challenge out there to Albo and to Peter Dutton.

463
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,700
Just make the legislation.

464
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,259
Modi banned TikTok last year.

465
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:20,339
Last week, literally just wiped it out of India with the sign of one bit of paper.

466
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,460
You can do it and it needs to happen.

467
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:23,259
You can do it.

468
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:27,400
Curiosity is a word that we see a lot with people we see as great leaders.

469
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,880
Are you naturally curious, Whipper?

470
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:30,460
Extremely curious.

471
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,099
I just want to understand things.

472
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,980
I want to be across it, whatever it might be.

473
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,559
I just, I like to make sense of things and I like to look into them too.

474
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,859
And quite often I find myself, the wife's gone to bed and I'm on the internet at night.

475
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,220
Don't let your mind run there too.

476
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,259
Nothing's okay there.

477
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:50,839
But I'm naturally intrigued by everything.

478
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,019
I think you need to be.

479
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,319
And I think that's all part of being hungry in life.

480
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,099
You know, how does that work and why does it do what it does?

481
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,440
I think that's part of the nature of it all coming together and making sense.

482
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,099
But knowing, and I think as you get older, you kind of realise pretty quickly you're not here for that long.

483
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:15,000
So part of being a good parent too is to grab as much as you can as far as education and wisdom that you can

484
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,319
and hand it.

485
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:22,000
Hand it on, hand it over and say, hey, look what I've collected for you because that was my job.

486
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,480
So naturally I try and through love of life and love of the kids, I'm curious.

487
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:29,759
I'm naturally very curious.

488
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:37,359
And we see people communicating with clarity as a real strength these days for people who do have, you know,

489
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,099
great achievement.

490
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,519
You communicate for a living.

491
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,359
It's a natural thing to you.

492
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,339
Is it something that you've thought about when you were trying to run a campaign like this?

493
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,339
I was nervous.

494
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,480
Because playing the village idiot, which is quite often the role on the show, I've done sort of 13 years

495
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,640
with Fitzy making fat jokes.

496
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,259
It's okay.

497
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,500
He couldn't make them if I didn't love him.

498
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,079
That's okay.

499
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,339
But you're right, putting your hand up and sort of having a crack at something different,

500
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,799
which is absolutely different for me to do.

501
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,480
Das, I mean, some of the stuff you do on radio is completely ridiculous.

502
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,319
This is off the page.

503
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,599
This is off topic, but you wouldn't believe it.

504
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,240
I quite recently wrote an erotic novel, Das, called The Far Too Personal Trainer.

505
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,559
Very, very erotic, completely off topic, but just using that.

506
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,220
Can we get that title again, please?

507
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,519
That just went through the cover.

508
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,640
The Far Too Personal Trainer.

509
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,000
Genius.

510
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,819
I love it.

511
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:38,380
The Far Too Personal Trainer.

512
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:44,299
But that is an element of curiosity because I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to try and write a book?

513
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,220
What would that be like?

514
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,859
And do that?

515
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:46,279
What's the?

516
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,180
What's the thrill of that like?

517
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,900
But secondly, that's sort of a more natural place for me to play, to do something ridiculous like that.

518
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,220
So to put my big boy pants on and say, hey, enough of the erotic reading, guys.

519
00:30:58,019 --> 00:30:59,019
Put that down.

520
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,740
Show me two hands in the air.

521
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,079
Let's talk about something serious.

522
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,599
And we probably love that.

523
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,539
That to me is life, isn't it?

524
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:12,599
That we all want to have fun and play the class clown, but most of us have got another element.

525
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,140
We actually can straighten up sometimes and go, hey,

526
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,579
this means a lot to me.

527
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,779
I'm prepared to be open like you've been in your life.

528
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,559
And I'm going to stand for something here.

529
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,880
And I've got these pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that are available to me that aren't available to everyone.

530
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,859
And I'm going to try and put them together and do something really special, which, again, I'm full of admiration.

531
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,559
Collaboration is something we talk about in this space as well.

532
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,039
I suppose you must have been able to pull on all threads of collaboration in this.

533
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:43,220
Well, the great thing was a mate of mine, Rob Galuzzo, who you mentioned earlier from Finch.

534
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,119
Finch is a production company.

535
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,599
But at the same time, you know, he's launched an initiative called the Lion's Share, which is about marketing.

536
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,079
If you use an animal in the marketing space at all, if it's a cabriette and there's a gorilla drumming,

537
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:02,920
well, then 0.5% of that marketing budget needs to go towards the conservation of that animal.

538
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,039
So he's had a lot of involvement in social movement, also in the education space.

539
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,660
But you're right.

540
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,660
When you look at those pieces that you can call on,

541
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,900
on the people you know, straight away, I thought ex-premier of New South Wales, Dom Perrottet,

542
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,839
now a backbencher, a bit of time on his hands.

543
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,480
And also, he's got seven children.

544
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,220
And I thought, if there's one person that's going to care about this topic, it'll be old mate Dom.

545
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,619
So we caught up for lunch and I told him of the idea.

546
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,799
And he said, you don't need to sell it to me.

547
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,500
I get it.

548
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,940
I've heard enough already.

549
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,319
I'm in 100%.

550
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:44,019
So he's been fantastic at making introductions.

551
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,740
You know, he still talks with the prime minister, also Peter Dutton,

552
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,339
a safety commissioner.

553
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:52,460
And he's also, he's done 10 years as a lawyer.

554
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,240
So he understands where the law sits on this.

555
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,700
So he's been instrumental in driving a lot of this and making the right phone calls to put the right team together.

556
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,220
Whipper, we love leadership stories.

557
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,799
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

558
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,220
Oh, my God.

559
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:09,440
It's a good question.

560
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,259
It's a big question.

561
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,400
Naturally, you fall to your mum and dad, don't you?

562
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,140
Because you're made up of both of them.

563
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,579
And, you know, mum's sort of the funny side of things.

564
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,779
And dad has a giant heart and understands, I suppose, what a gentleman should be.

565
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:26,059
But he's also great with advice.

566
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:35,359
You know, he'll let you know when you're jumping your shadows and when to keep the powder dry and all these sorts of sayings that come with it.

567
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,900
So, you know, they're an inspiration.

568
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,079
But I think outside of that, business leaders as well.

569
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,539
Certainly not footballers.

570
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:54,460
I mean, if we talk about great footballers, we would obviously fall to sort of the Essendon Football Club, the likes of Danaher's.

571
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:01,059
You know, I saw a photo the other day, and it must have been the premiership winning team from maybe 93?

572
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:03,839
Paul Salmon.

573
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,000
The general was still there, Mark Harvey.

574
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,420
And it was just amazing to see that group of guys back together again.

575
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,179
And they have something special.

576
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:23,460
And I can tie that back in because at that moment in time, in that photo, they're able to look back and go, hey, we went together now because we did something back then.

577
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,699
And I think like every radio show, you get together at the end of the year and you look back on what you have achieved.

578
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,420
You know, you've got the power to make a really significant change.

579
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,880
That was the first grand final I went to with Michael Long.

580
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,380
I think I kicked the goal, the first goal with Steve Silvani on the line.

581
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,159
Baby bombers.

582
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,659
And I was a young 17-year-old Bulldog recruit sitting behind the goals.

583
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,219
And I was dreaming that they would recruit me the following year.

584
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,099
So a special place in my heart that year.

585
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,840
So the goal, were you sitting behind the goals that Michael Long kicked straight out of the centre there?

586
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,780
I was sitting directly behind it, sitting next to the great Tony McGuinness.

587
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeah, yes.

588
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,639
And I was leaving Footscray to go back to Adelaide.

589
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:03,699
And they'd sort of had this crossover of a South Australian leaving the Bulldogs.

590
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,539
And it was such a great experience to sit next to him at a grand final and hear him talk me through it.

591
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,059
And there's no way Sauce touched that.

592
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,019
There's absolutely no way.

593
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:18,440
And I'm trying to, was it Alvin who tried to tackle Michael Long, Tommy Alvin, whatever his name was?

594
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,920
There were so many great moments.

595
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,260
What do you mean Tommy Alvin?

596
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,559
But it was the baby bombers, Smoke and Joe Mercedi.

597
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,000
It was just awesome.

598
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,119
Ricky Ollaranshaw.

599
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,039
Ricky Ollaranshaw.

600
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:27,980
David Cowthorne.

601
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,980
Yes, Cowthorne.

602
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,760
A couple of Johnsons maybe, or that could have been afterwards.

603
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,619
But it was an amazing time.

604
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,139
It was great.

605
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,119
Mark Mercurio.

606
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,280
It's all alumni of my era.

607
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,480
They were an amazing team.

608
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,320
And it was great.

609
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,960
Gavin Wanganame played in that grand final.

610
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,739
I remember seeing him stretch out once.

611
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,440
And he bent over and put his elbows on the ground.

612
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,099
And I thought, you really are the rubber man, aren't you, Gav?

613
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,059
I saw him the other night at the airport.

614
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:52,920
What a true gentleman.

615
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,940
How well has he aged, Gavin?

616
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,199
He looks like he can play now and does beautiful art, Gavin.

617
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,599
Yeah.

618
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:01,840
Going back to his culture.

619
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,840
And I remember he was a 16-year-old growing up in South Australia.

620
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,440
And he was just such a, and still is such a wonderful person.

621
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,500
This could be another hour.

622
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,840
And we could talk about you playing.

623
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:14,599
Playing first 18 footy in year 10.

624
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,659
Oh, you don't need to bring that up.

625
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,039
I've done my homework with that.

626
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,119
And I know that your reputation at Saskatchewan College in year 10

627
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,019
precedes you.

628
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,719
I mean, you would know not many kids play first footy in year 10.

629
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,519
So that's quite a significant bit of information you've just shared

630
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,119
with the listeners that does.

631
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,519
It's from Gavin Wanganame to Whipper playing for Scotch

632
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,420
was a perfect transition.

633
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,440
I thought it needed to be said.

634
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:45,599
The final question for me, in the work we do,

635
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,119
we're obsessed with this world of collaboration.

636
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,599
You're trying to achieve something that I think is in the interest

637
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,840
of all Australians and perhaps in other areas of your life.

638
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,780
You've got a great collaboration with Fitzy, who's just a gem.

639
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,719
And Kate Ritchie's got an incredible history of what she does.

640
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,900
Have you ever looked and thought, God, if I could collaborate

641
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,300
with that one person on this passion, a name springs to mind?

642
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,300
I mean, I think when it comes to collaboration and output,

643
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,699
you consider, if you try, I mean, for a lot of the initial stages,

644
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:16,780
I think, of any initiative or movement, it's about noise, isn't it?

645
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,960
And if you look at leaders who create a lot of noise,

646
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,099
you'd probably have to jump to somebody like Richard Branson,

647
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,360
you know, ageing but will never age.

648
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,079
You know, he still kitesurfs in the morning.

649
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,559
He still does ridiculous things.

650
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:34,079
I think I saw him jumping off a, I don't know,

651
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,219
some sort of platform the other day into the water, has his own island.

652
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,420
But when it comes to doing great things,

653
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:42,679
he knows how to.

654
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,440
He knows how to create a song and dance.

655
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,059
So I think everybody's stumbled over the book,

656
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:52,639
probably losing my virginity at some stage to hear about how he makes noise.

657
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,159
Because I think a lot of people, what I didn't realize too,

658
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:59,780
is a lot of people in business, they've had to be extremely creative

659
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,199
to get to where they are because that strategic mind of going,

660
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,480
well, this is going to create this reaction and to pull this off over here,

661
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,639
I need to make that work.

662
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,639
So that strategy required is extremely creative.

663
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,139
I think people sometimes miss that.

664
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,719
I think they consider a business leader to have a product that they've just steered

665
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,719
to the top very well.

666
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,500
But there's a hell of a lot more that goes on.

667
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,539
But Richard Branson, to see the way he continues to make noise

668
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,599
by not being so serious about it, I think that's part of his skill.

669
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,800
You know, there's that great story of him inviting all the CEOs

670
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,800
from different corporations around for a drink by the pool.

671
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,119
And one by one, he ran around pushing them in.

672
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,360
And he's in their suits.

673
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,639
Now, if he just did that to create a story to be told on this podcast,

674
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,900
that's brilliant.

675
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,559
Genius.

676
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,300
Outstanding.

677
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,880
So I do look up to people like that because they don't stop having a go.

678
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,239
You know, you've got to be brave to have a go and they don't stop.

679
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,260
And you know what I love, I can feel the synergy there is that we're talking

680
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,960
about incredibly serious, heartbreaking stories, and I've got a phone full of them as well.

681
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,059
Yeah.

682
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:12,099
Yeah.

683
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,320
I feel tragically around people who are devastated by this.

684
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,960
But, you know, you can do it with a smile.

685
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:18,480
You have to.

686
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,159
To have a fit, you've got that great balance of this is a course,

687
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,400
36 months that we all should get behind.

688
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,360
You're going to lobby as hard as you can to make this transition.

689
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,239
But you still had to do it Richard Branson style.

690
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,920
And I think that sums you up, Whipper.

691
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,380
I reckon that makes sense.

692
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,719
At the moment, we kicked it off last night just for the fun of it.

693
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,079
We're encouraging people to, if you go to my Instagram page,

694
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:41,860
which is Whipper1.

695
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,900
You'll see the 36 Months logo.

696
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,699
But what we're encouraging people is to take that logo, put it on Instagram.

697
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,980
And I can see the conflict there.

698
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,340
But once again, we don't have a problem with Instagram.

699
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,820
We have a problem with adolescents on Instagram.

700
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,940
But include a photo of when you were 13.

701
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,380
What were you doing at 13?

702
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,219
Yeah, you know, we're encouraging people to do that at the moment outside of sort

703
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,260
of just going to the petition at 36months.com.au.

704
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,380
We want everyone to sign up just to make

705
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,460
as much noise to let the Prime Minister know that this is the change required.

706
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,460
I'm on to it, Whipper. I'm in your corner.

707
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,900
It's been great to catch up with you.

708
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:23,860
As I said, I've been a long time admirer of the amount of effort that you put

709
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,739
in to support great causes and have a lot of fun along the way.

710
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,059
So I really appreciate you telling the story today.

711
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:31,860
And it's an amazing campaign you're

712
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,059
running and couldn't be more positive about wanting to make it happen.

713
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:35,460
Thanks again.

714
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:36,739
Likewise, Dars.

715
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,539
And thanks for acknowledging the year 10 first footy stuff.

716
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:41,340
I mean, when I sent you the first footy, you said,

717
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,260
I'll send you that email saying on one condition, I'll join the podcast if you

718
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,820
mentioned this, just use that as sort of the selling line of the whatever you get.

719
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:51,139
I'll leave it up to you, whatever you go with, mate.

720
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,940
It's resonated with me, Whipper.

721
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:59,500
The headline is it's a multi-talented radio superstar who could have been anything.

722
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,699
Your words, Dars.

723
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,579
Always a great pleasure to catch up with you.

724
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:06,139
Thanks, Whipper. Thanks, brother.

725
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,539
