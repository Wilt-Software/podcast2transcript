00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,779
with the legendary Mick Doohan, as much as I did recording it.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,500
Mick is one of Australia's greatest ever sportsmen,

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,460
500cc, five-time motorcycle champion,

5
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,660
one of the most successful sportsmen in Australian history.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,000
And beyond that, an incredible success story post his sporting life.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,460
Mick's courage to come back from almost having his leg amputated

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,820
is an incredible story of bravery, of resilience,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,960
and street-smart success with Mick Doohan.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,219
Fascinating. I'm sure you're going to enjoy the wisdom

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,359
that Mick shares in this upcoming chat.

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,679
Mick Doohan epitomises everything we love and are passionate about

13
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,880
in the world we created called Alita.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,280
Space co-founded with my great friend Matt Wadowitz,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,640
a friend from the age of 12,

16
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,920
passionate about creating great education and leadership spaces,

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,200
and also a world of collaboration, inspiring connections.

18
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,920

into bespoke leadership forums to lead, to learn, and collaborate.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,819
You don't have to be an Australian sporting legend like Mick Doohan to take part.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,400
We love the passion of getting people together to lead, to learn, and to share ideas.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,760
a mattress like no other.

And we know that inspiration,

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,920
and people like Mick Doohan really understand

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,700
the health benefits of sleep and sleeping well.

31
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,120
And to sleep on the world's best NASA-approved bedding

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,379
is a decision that I assure you will change your life.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,780
Hope you enjoy this chat.

34
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,489
A few athletes have dominated international sport

35
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,769
like Sport Australia Hall of Fame 500cc motorcycle racing legend Mick Doohan.

36
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,750
Mick won five consecutive world championship titles

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,870
from 1994 to 1998, winning 54 Grand Prix's across his career,

38
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,629
including a record.

39
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,909
12 in the 1997 season.

40
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,310
Mick's sporting record is legendary.

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,169
Equally impressive is his post-sporting success in the commercial world.

42
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,090
Mick is a serious player in the global aviation world,

43
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,849
owning Platinum Business Aviation Centres at Essendon and Gold Coast Airports.

44
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,030
And his business is the world's largest trader of corporate aircraft.

45
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,189
Mick, great to spend some time with you in town for the Melbourne Grand Prix.

46
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:40,409
Thanks for taking the time.

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,229
Absolute pleasure.

48
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,689
Now, can I start with your record on the briar?

49
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,229
It was incredible.

50
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,389
What were the skills?

51
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,189
When you look back, I mean, it's such a competitive sport on an international stage.

52
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,250
What were the skills that you felt set you apart?

53
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,069
Difficult to know what really made the difference,

54
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,409
but I think just the love of it.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,530
And I think the same with anybody, you know,

56
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,210
to get to the top of their sport or to anything,

57
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,530
you've got to really love it.

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,449
You've got to keep working at it

59
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,469
and you've just got to find little loopholes what others can't,

60
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,750
so to dominate it.

61
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,629
But I think it all comes back down to the passion.

62
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,789
If you don't have the passion,

63
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:15,629
you're not going to...

64
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,449
have the desire to want to put yourself at risk, you know,

65
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:20,090
whether it be in your game in football,

66
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,689
getting belted by people

67
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,789
or crashing into barriers at 200-odd kilometres an hour.

68
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,969
Well, it's funny, Sam, when I, you know,

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,310
and look at your story and you think you're on your way

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,110
to winning your first world championship in 1992

71
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,490
and that famous horrific crash happens,

72
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,650
so you talk about, you know, football

73
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,250
and that doesn't seem like a problem.

74
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,629
Falling off a motorbike at 200 k's an hour

75
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,870
feels like a serious problem

76
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,629
and you're close to getting your leg out,

77
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,210
amputated, a lot of medical advice.

78
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,169
I understand it was a Grand Prix medico, Dr. Claudio Costa,

79
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,009
who had the idea that you could sew your legs together

80
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,289
and that would save your leg.

81
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,509
Is that an accurate part of the story?

82
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:58,930
Yeah.

83
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,150
I guess Dr. Costa, in Holland,

84
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,169
where they butchered it, essentially,

85
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,250
there's no other way to say it, it was malpractice.

86
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,289
They were wanting...

87
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,689
Within 24 hours, they were going to amputate my leg.

88
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,689
I think Costa had heard about this,

89
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,470
so he then come and medevaced me out of there.

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,649
Myself and another guy, Kevin Schwantz,

91
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:27,529
took me back to Italy, to Bologna,

92
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,949
and more he was...

93
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,389
Because they'd thinned my blood that much up in Holland

94
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,730
that he was more concerned about my internal organs failing,

95
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,050
first and foremost,

96
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,569
so he got those back on some...

97
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,250
You know, stabilised, I guess.

98
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:44,670
And then it was...

99
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,769
It was said about the leg.

100
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,269
And really, the leg, sewing the leg together,

101
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,629
that was only...

102
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,370
That was the quickest way for me to return to riding.

103
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,629
And it wasn't the...

104
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,410
It was also the most barbaric way of doing it.

105
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,649
You know, the logical way for a doctor also was take a year out.

106
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,670
You know, we've got some major issues here.

107
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,790
Take freestanding flaps from either the backside

108
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,230
or your lower back area

109
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,589
and then graft them on to the areas where things have gone necrotic.

110
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,870
So gangrene had set in and all this and that.

111
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,709
So that was a major issue.

112
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:21,670
So then he...

113
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,230
In the past, they hadn't done that,

114
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,930
sewing the legs together for many years anyway.

115
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,930
And so what was happening when you say sew the legs together,

116
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,910
because I had very little blood supply,

117
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,629
because compartment syndrome,

118
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,589
it sort of happens in all forms of...

119
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,750
Like in football, I'm sure it's happened before.

120
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:40,990
Yeah.

121
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,670
So compartment syndrome is said...

122
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,949
Yeah.

123
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,949
It's said in.

124
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,009
So my circulation on the lower limb was pretty, pretty poor.

125
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,410
So we fed the...

126
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,350
One, we used the graft from the left leg

127
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,810
to plug the gap I had,

128
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,269
the big hole that they'd spooned out,

129
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,910
physically spooned out.

130
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,550
And then had the blood supply from the left leg feeding the right

131
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,550
to sort of keep it so it actually would take.

132
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,149
Because again, a free flap that early on

133
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,589
and the blood supply wasn't good.

134
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:14,649
Yeah.

135
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,350
It wasn't good enough for the graft to actually take.

136
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,529
So the legs were sewn together for two weeks or 14 nights.

137
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,029
And on the 15th, the 14th night,

138
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,310
they cut half of it to just cut the supply,

139
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,350
the blood supply area,

140
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,490
to just to see if it was going to survive.

141
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,370
And if it was, it looked like it wasn't,

142
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,649
they were going to then reattach it.

143
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,569
Thankfully it did.

144
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,009
And then I was able to go to the bathroom a lot easier.

145
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,790
I can assure you after that once we were able to cut them completely.

146
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,990
But look, previously they'd also,

147
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,649
they'd bolt the legs together.

148
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,170
In that scenario, when I say bolt the legs together,

149
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:55,649
put rods through your femurs and the lower limbs as well.

150
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,629
But again, having Swiss cheese for bones

151
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,290
when you're going back motorcycle racing wasn't ideal either.

152
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,250
So they basically put me in a plaster cast,

153
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,470
a scotch cast and had windows in the front and back

154
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,949
so they could actually get in there and clean it and keep it going.

155
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,750
So one, it was uncomfortable.

156
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,209
Two, it was very barbaric.

157
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,250
Costa knew that, but it was the only option.

158
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,850
So I was back on the bike in seven weeks essentially from all that.

159
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,970
So in hindsight, stupidity.

160
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,389
Because at the end of the day, as you say,

161
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,629
I didn't win the championship.

162
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,970
I lost by a few points at the end after losing,

163
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,129
missing five races.

164
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,569
I'm grimacing all the way through it.

165
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,949
I just can't imagine that being an option in the current world.

166
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,689
Going back, so you really,

167
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,529
you got a horrible malpractice at the start.

168
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,829
Is that what set you onto the path?

169
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:45,430
Totally.

170
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,589
And back in those days of 92 in Holland,

171
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,930
I since learned after experiencing all this

172
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,170
and Holland, everything is a public system anyway.

173
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,329
But had you had a car accident on the motorway,

174
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,990
which is right beside the circuit there

175
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,810
and massive trauma injuries,

176
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,490
they would have medevaced you to Amsterdam or Groningen,

177
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,629
not this little veterinarian clinic

178
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,509
where it would have been approved to host the ass and teeth.

179
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,829
Which was called back then,

180
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,029
which is around the Moto Grand Prix series.

181
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,529
And basically the doctors weren't up to the speed,

182
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,769
to be honest.

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,470
And Costa was actually there because he was the track doctor.

184
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,069
But because Europe wasn't like it is now,

185
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,950
he couldn't actually practice in Holland.

186
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,129
But he was in the surgery when it was that evening.

187
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,049
In Holland when that was going on.

188
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:43,110
So let's say it was a Friday or a Saturday,

189
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,490
I can't remember.

190
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:43,509
I can't remember.

191
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,529
I can't remember.

192
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,049
I think it was a Friday when I had the accident.

193
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,669
Friday evening, I'm having the surgery

194
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,450
because it was, in my mind, there was two weekends off,

195
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,509
which was a long time.

196
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,570
So if I bolt it back together, bolt the leg back together,

197
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,230
I could actually compete in the next, you know,

198
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:02,269
some way, shape or form in Hungary a few weeks later.

199
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,269
So you were seriously contemplating in your mind

200
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,250
on that operating cell, I'll get back into it.

201
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:06,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,529
That's insane.

203
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,590
Just put the leg back together, zip it up and away we go.

204
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,509
But, you know, I had American guys

205
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:18,710
there who were looking after some very specialised surgeons

206
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,190
working for the 49ers in San Francisco,

207
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,409
neurosurgeons.

208
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,190
I had a whole bunch of people just,

209
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,490
Costa said, he said, look, put it in a plaster cast.

210
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,730
It was a spiral fracture.

211
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,029
I broke my own leg actually,

212
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,970
trying to get out from underneath the bike.

213
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,590
But he said, put it in a plaster cast

214
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,970
and you'll be back in Brazil in six weeks' time.

215
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,190
I was back in six weeks' time.

216
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,610
But I should have just done that.

217
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,490
I went to this guy.

218
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,590
I said, I looked around and I said,

219
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,769
who's the best guy here?

220
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,850
Because it was a Dutch guy was there as well.

221
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,009
And just back on that, I should say,

222
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,610
Costa had a mobile clinic, a Clinica Mobile, he'd say.

223
00:09:55,669 --> 00:10:00,190
It was like just a truck with some bits and pieces

224
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,169
would come out the side.

225
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,710
So he could do x-rays.

226
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,250
He could do bits and pieces in there.

227
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,929
So to see what's going on and then,

228
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,009
but then you had to go off to the local

229
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,909
if you wanted to get surgery or whatever.

230
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,470
He could do it back in Italy.

231
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,509
He could do it back in Italy or you'd go somewhere else.

232
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,409
But I'd said to this Dutch doctor,

233
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,750
he was actually in there and I said,

234
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,909
well, who's the best guy?

235
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,409
And generally in my experiences with doctors,

236
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,289
they'll say, you know, it's either me or it's my best.

237
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,529
Actually, I know a guy who specializes in that,

238
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,970
you know, and you generally trust doctor's opinions anyway,

239
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,129
you know, and he said,

240
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,990
which I thought was actually even odd at the time.

241
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:37,850
He said, we all went to the same university,

242
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,889
you know, meaning that, you know, we're all the same.

243
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,009
We're all as good as each other.

244
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,309
And I thought, well, shit,

245
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,590
but, you know, again, back up.

246
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,129
My mind was I'm leading the world championship.

247
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,190
I missed out just by a few points the year before.

248
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,450
My competitor's injured.

249
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,190
He's actually gone home.

250
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,470
So I want to actually sort of capitalize on this

251
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,090
and I'll be back.

252
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,809
So let's just bolt it together and I'll be back in two weeks.

253
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,549
And that was a wrong, wrong, wrong decision.

254
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,149
And even eight weeks later, Mick,

255
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:10,230
I can't imagine, you know, horrific pain.

256
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,950
And, you know, you've got what you've been through,

257
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,289
you know, your leg.

258
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:14,090
You've got your leg sewn together.

259
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,070
Chance you're going to lose a leg.

260
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,169
I mean, how do you get back on a bike at 200 k's an hour?

261
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,389
What do you need in your mind to overcome that sense of fear?

262
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,710
I think it's, it wasn't so much of, um,

263
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,389
you need to understand what happened in the first place.

264
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,250
And so I don't think that your confidence is a knock

265
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,529
because you know why you crashed, you know what happened.

266
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:43,289
So, you know, if you're physically capable of riding again,

267
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,870
that, you know, the likelihood of that happening again is it's there,

268
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,169
but I mean, it's very remote.

269
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,850
So no dent in your confidence, no dent in your confidence at that point in time,

270
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:58,669
you know, and, um, but a bit, but by being the biggest problem was six weeks later,

271
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,809
I'd been, been on my back essentially for six weeks and I had no feeling.

272
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,429
So again, the pain wasn't really such an issue because I really didn't have

273
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,909
any feeling from the knee down.

274
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,190
And, um, so it was just like another, it was just,

275
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,289
Yeah.

276
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,009
It was like a prosthetic leg to be honest, but thankfully it wasn't,

277
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,070
it was still attached.

278
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,429
And, uh, so that probably helped me a little bit, but, um, but it's also,

279
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,090
you know, I'd lost the use of my ankle, you know, I haven't got the feel.

280
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,610
I haven't got the strength because these things, you steer them with your legs

281
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,110
and you know, you've got 200 horsepower running through the rear wheel on

282
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,929
something which back then was 130 kilos and the front wheels really just dancing

283
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,090
around, you lean it, you use your, your mid.

284
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,190
Section and your legs to steer the bike, you just operating the, the accelerator

285
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,090
and the brakes and the clutch or the throttle, you know, with, with all that,

286
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,970
the rest of it, it's just the wheels just there to make it look good on the front.

287
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,029
It's basically a, uh, a unicycle.

288
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,610
And then to take half a leg out.

289
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,269
I mean, that's gotta be a serious job.

290
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,429
And then they, they install a, a thumb brake.

291
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:04,809
So that was the following year.

292
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,049
Yeah.

293
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,590
So I knew what, so for those two races, I came back.

294
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,470
The first race in Brazil was a bit of a, it was a waste of time.

295
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,970
I'd practice.

296
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,110
Actually, the doctor cost her, so I knew back then it was basically had to walk

297
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,429
about, you know, 20 steps from, from a chair to the bike.

298
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,009
And if you could make that walk, you're fit to ride.

299
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,110
So I'd practice that quite a bit, but, uh, you know, I was dead by

300
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,110
the time I got to the bike and, um, but, but yeah, during that race, it

301
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,470
won't bore you with the whole, the way it all worked out, but, but during that

302
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,850
race there, my leg would be flying.

303
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,409
Swinging off the bike cause I couldn't feel it as I say, but you could feel it just

304
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,509
through the seat of your pants and it's not actually sort of on the footrests.

305
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,309
And then you'd look down and, and at 200 odd kilometers an hour and

306
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,809
just place it back onto the bike.

307
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,230
So, so that was a, that was a difficulty.

308
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,289
It was actually physically riding the bike, the way it needed to be, to be

309
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,269
ridden and I had a few other crashes because I couldn't, and then likewise

310
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:08,730
with the brake, I, I, so I only had a front brake instead of a rear brake.

311
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,250
So the rear brake helps stabilize everything and keep the, keep the, the

312
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,830
balance of the bike.

313
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,149
And especially entering turns and coming off a turn.

314
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:22,090
And, um, so it wasn't until about, um, the beginning of the following year

315
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,009
that I'd convinced Honda that, you know, let's do a handbrake.

316
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:31,230
So we, that the Honda had, uh, put on a, a, a, a brake like a scooter.

317
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,970
You've got the front brake and the rear brake on the other side, but you've also

318
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,830
got the clutch and the clutch, as I say, you've got 200 odd horsepower running

319
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,830
through the rear tire and there was no traction control or anything like that.

320
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,230
So if it spun and it'd spin that quick, that rolling out of the throttle wouldn't

321
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,950
stop it spinning.

322
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,009
It'd send you about 15 foot in the air as, as it's kicking you off.

323
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,490
So you needed to use the clutch to disengage the, um, disengage the back

324
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,470
wheel straighter and the power straight out of it.

325
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,590
And so trying to use the, the index finger and then the middle finger

326
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,389
independently is pretty hard.

327
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,730
So, so during that first race sort of went to what is essentially like an

328
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,710
ag bike or a jet ski, a little thumb operated brake, put that on.

329
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,129
And then next weekend I was back on the podium and then that year was a recovery

330
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,330
year and then 94, I won a championship again.

331
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,789
Once I got fully healed, I ended up going back to the guys in the States who were

332
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,129
looking after the San Jose Sharks and the, and the San Francisco 49ers who,

333
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,730
who put my leg back together.

334
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,529
And Mickey, how are you walking today?

335
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,830
And we catch up and, um, beautiful wife, uh, Selena's with you and you, and

336
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,610
there's a noticeable limp and, and that's, you know, your, your life.

337
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,450
I mean, as a, do you look back and think with any regret?

338
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:49,029
Well, not at all, you know, to be honest, I'm fortunate, um, to one of being

339
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,090
able to put myself in that position, not for the crash, but I mean, to, to, to

340
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,850
be able to have led the life that I have.

341
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,149
Um, and, and, and equally, there's plenty of people who fall downstairs or, you

342
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:02,850
know, just going through general life, have injuries, you know?

343
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,049
So the thing is, I knew that I could possibly hurt myself at some point.

344
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,049
So I don't regret any of that.

345
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,070
And I don't, I don't, um, dwell on it.

346
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,649
I just got to keep pushing forward.

347
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,129
And for me, it's, as I say, it is, you know, we're 20, 23 now, you know, this

348
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,789
was 1992, so the majority of my life's been like this anyway.

349
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,070
And, um, and as I say, I think the difference between a sports person and,

350
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,289
uh, and, and the average man on the street, we can have the same, or they can

351
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,350
have the same injuries, but you're not actually expecting to have an injury.

352
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,529
We expect to have an injury.

353
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,110
So we tend to sort of just move on pretty quickly.

354
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,730
And you are so short term focused on that, that stage of your life.

355
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,669
You've got this ambition to be.

356
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,149
Well, champion, you, you go on to win five more, as I said, uh, it's an

357
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,509
extraordinary time when you look back, the journos, I understand called you

358
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,269
dead by June doing, which, which when you look back, it's pretty disgraceful,

359
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,950
really, isn't it?

360
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,669
I was, you know, media in those times to have, but clearly they saw your bravery

361
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:04,809
and your courage as being at another level and your risk taking another, were

362
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,349
you conscious of that and, and how did you feel about that at the time?

363
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,569
Yeah, well, the dead by June thing, I don't know who was, I think a South African,

364
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,609
um, uh, journalist at the time, because I came from Australia.

365
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,990
I was riding a two 50 CC street bike, like a production bike here in 87, 89.

366
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,809
I'm on a 500 CC grand Prix bike or MotoGP bike.

367
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,690
So I come out of obscurity basically.

368
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,450
So nobody really knew who this kid was from Australia.

369
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:34,930
And all of a sudden I'm on something with 200 horsepower was on something two years

370
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,730
earlier with 35 horsepower, you know, that bike was heavier than the one, you know?

371
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,609
So there was a little bit of trial and error.

372
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,630
I'm more error than trial.

373
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,049
So, uh, and everything up until I hopped on a MotoGP bike was pretty, for me, it felt

374
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,549
pretty easy to ride.

375
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:54,930
And then once, once I hopped on that, it was like, it was a big wake up call.

376
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,950
And the guys, you know, you back in those days, the Wayne, you know, Wayne Gardner

377
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,789
was, was the man, but you know, Wayne, Wayne Rainey, Eddie Lawson, Kevin Schwartz,

378
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:07,809
there's a bunch of them in there and it's honestly, they're in a different planet to

379
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,710
be on what I'd been used to even in some of the world, super bike staff, some of the

380
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,670
other things, what I did.

381
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,769
I did in, uh, competed in, in 98.

382
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,029
So it was a wake up call.

383
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:25,670
And, and, and again, probably I did, um, push myself too far, but unfortunately with,

384
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:31,170
with, with everything, you know, you learn a lot more by your mistakes than you do by,

385
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,069
by getting it right sometimes.

386
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:37,529
And, and unfortunately, um, I didn't have that experience coming through when other,

387
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:42,230
in other, uh, lower disciplines, just from the way I come through so quick.

388
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,789
But, uh, but that said, after June, I very rarely crashed.

389
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,289
And then, um, and then throughout my, for the rest of the, well, even the whole Grand

390
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,690
Prix career, I crashed less than 30 times.

391
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,130
And, um, some, I think the best I did was about 18 months.

392
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,410
And back then we'd do, uh, without a crash back then, we'd do a lot of testing, a lot

393
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:01,809
of riding.

394
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,609
And so I'm doing about 10,000 kilometers of race miles a year, which is a lot.

395
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:09,069
And then, um, without a crash.

396
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:12,450
So today these modern guys are different.

397
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,730
Um, thankfully they're not, they're not doing the big high sides and whatever, but

398
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,029
I mean, some of these guys are crashing 30 times a year, but.

399
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,450
Is that the numbers now, is it?

400
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,049
It is, yeah.

401
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,089
So 30 in your second half of your career is quite.

402
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,829
Well, actually from the start, so the dead by June was the first, um, you know, cause

403
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,789
that was at the beginning, you know, so I've come in, you know, the season started the

404
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:35,630
beginning of March.

405
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,910
So that's what this South African journo, he lives in Britain, Michael Scott.

406
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,650
And he's like, oh, this kid's not going to, he's going to be dead.

407
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:49,589
You know, so that's where that, so, but, um, um, so I, I've, I've got through that

408
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:54,750
season and the next season I was third and then, um, and then, uh, then second and then

409
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,430
second again with the leg and then blah, blah, blah.

410
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,890
So it's sort of, once I got the grasp of it, I was okay.

411
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,430
I just needed to learn those mistakes.

412
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,049
Unfortunately on a bike, every time you make a mistake, you're on your backside, you know,

413
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:12,289
with a car, you sort of, you know, you can still have a big crash in a car, but you know,

414
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:12,650
the small.

415
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,970
The ones, at least you just spin, put it back into first and drive off again, you know?

416
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,150
Well, you got so good that, that no one got near you and you won five in a row.

417
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,670
And, and, you know, I remember that era and watching and not knowing your sport, but thinking

418
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,349
God, our Aussie guy is just so much better.

419
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,549
And it seemed like you could get in front and you were so in control of what you're

420
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,289
doing in the end that you could really, you know, just, just ride within yourself.

421
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,650
Is that, was there a period of time where you just felt if I, if I get it right, no

422
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,390
one's going to get near me?

423
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:40,890
Yeah.

424
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,849
Well, that's the.

425
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,609
Well, that's what kept me going when I had the, uh, the accident, uh, with it, when I

426
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:51,150
nearly lost my leg, um, is I knew that if I get myself back to fitness, because I ended

427
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,970
up winning with a broken leg still the year in 93, I knew if I could get back, even with

428
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,849
the, the, the, the, my ankle being fused and, um, and using a rear brake on the, on the

429
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:04,990
handlebar and so on.

430
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,549
So that gave me confidence.

431
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,569
I knew if I got myself some way fit, I'd be fine.

432
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,769
And then, and then that, that was a bit the.

433
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,650
Same that you got to a point where you'd win at the slowest possible speed.

434
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,089
So you just manage where your competitor is.

435
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,289
And then, um, you know, at the end of the day, you only need to win by, by, by, by half

436
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,970
an inch, you know, and you've won the race.

437
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,569
Nobody remembers who finished second.

438
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,109
So, and nobody remembers how much you won by.

439
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:33,690
So, you know, sometimes you win by, by a lot.

440
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,650
You just, at other times you just manage it and just play with it a little bit.

441
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,170
And, uh, but, um, it's.

442
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:47,789
Yeah, at the end of the day, it was just all about winning and managing and also de-risking

443
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:47,970
it.

444
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,329
And so, but I mean, it's the same with any sport.

445
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,349
You've got to keep focused on what you, especially in a speed sport.

446
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:02,849
So you've, you've got to maintain, um, you've got to maintain that vision on, on not making

447
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,569
a mistake.

448
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,890
And so your mindset needs to be 100% immersed in what you're doing.

449
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,250
Cause soon as you start to have time to think about what's going on, I'm going to actually

450
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:11,829
slow up a little bit.

451
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,609
You'll slow up and you'll make a mistake, you know, because you're not 100% committed

452
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,670
to being focused on the job.

453
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,529
At the time, you're undisputedly the best motorbike rider in the world and revered around

454
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:23,990
the world.

455
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:30,069
The best four wheel, uh, athlete, uh, if you like was Michael Schumacher and you two formed

456
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:32,029
this great friendship, lifelong friendship.

457
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,430
Tell us, did you learn a bit from each other?

458
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,289
Was there obviously great mutual respect at the time?

459
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,829
Yeah, we'd look without a doubt and we'd push each other off the circuit, uh, you know,

460
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:48,089
we were, the good thing is we're in different disciplines, you know, the, the, the, um, back

461
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:52,289
in those days, and it is today that there's still the two largest motor sports on the

462
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,009
planet, but the one you'd have an F1 one weekend and a MotoGP for the next.

463
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,529
And, um, and, um, and in between that we'd be training a bit, but, but we weren't really

464
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:03,650
competing against each other.

465
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,369
It's not like him.

466
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,410
He's right driving against, you know, Mika Hakkinen or something, and they can't really

467
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,369
share different mindsets.

468
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:11,710
So we'd, we'd share the way.

469
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,690
We go, I think about going racing and, uh, and, uh, and he equally off, like with training,

470
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,930
pushing each other, you know, you, you, you'd know, we'd, you'd know, you'd be up against

471
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,089
whatever we go training with to be a, it'd be a competition, you know?

472
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,269
So, and it was good.

473
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,190
So you'd push each other.

474
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,529
We become good friends like that.

475
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,069
He was living beside, uh, beside us in 94.

476
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,769
He was world champion.

477
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,609
I was world champion and, and, and likewise, 95, so on.

478
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,349
And, uh, and we had similar sponsors.

479
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:48,069
And then, um, um, and then, yeah, he was living beside, beside, um, beside me in Monaco.

480
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:53,690
And then, um, and so it was pretty easy to, to train together and do different things

481
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:53,990
together.

482
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,329
And we've become and remain friends today.

483
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,930
Did I read, Mick, that, uh, he bought your two kids, Alexis and Jack, their first go

484
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,309
karts?

485
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:02,990
That's right.

486
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,069
He helped arrange those.

487
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,289
Yeah.

488
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,730
So, uh, so, um, so both of the kids had, and we still got them back at home, to be honest.

489
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,289
And that, you know, it's amazing.

490
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:17,309
And I love, uh, the way the world works and, you know, Jack's, uh, Formula Two, incredible

491
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:23,210
success, your, your son and, uh, and, uh, and Michael's son, Mick, you know, um, racing

492
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,869
Formula One.

493
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,109
And I'm sure they've grown up with a great friendship, but it must be pretty special

494
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,950
to see the two of them pursuing the same love.

495
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:30,789
No, totally.

496
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:36,109
And, uh, well, you know, Mick, there's probably more pressure on young Mick Schumacher with

497
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:41,069
a father like Michael, um, in the same discipline, at least Jack's on the four wheel.

498
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,130
So it'd be difficult, more pressure on him, I'd believe if he was trying to race motorcycles

499
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,990
and, and it's much better for us as parents that he's not, it's much easier, even though

500
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,069
it's stressful watching him in a car, but it's a lot easier to watch as a parent, him

501
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:56,509
in the car.

502
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:01,970
But, but young Mick and, and, and Jack are great mates and have been for a long while.

503
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:07,390
But, um, you know, when, when, when, uh, when Mick's in Australia, he's generally sort of

504
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,009
staying with us and the kids go off.

505
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,269
So, well, they're not kids anymore, but the boys go.

506
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:14,529
They go off surfing and messing around and whatever they do as kids, you know.

507
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,690
It's, uh, it's brilliant, isn't it?

508
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,009
Did I read that you're, you're Jack as a five-year-old fell off a bike on the, on the family property

509
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,230
and broke a leg as well.

510
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,170
And that's right.

511
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:23,730
And then when.

512
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,349
So that, that pretty, yeah, well it did it.

513
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,849
Um, he, he broke his leg, uh, when he was five.

514
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,390
That's right.

515
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:37,009
And then, uh, and then he was a bit gun shy of bikes and he got into BMX and, uh, started

516
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:40,529
racing BMX, but then it was more surfing, uh, rugby.

517
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,069
Yeah.

518
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,369
And, uh, athletics, typical kid stuff.

519
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,369
And then, and then slowly got into karting because his buddies were go-kart racing.

520
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,970
And then, and then the go-karting took off.

521
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,450
He won a few go-kart races.

522
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,150
We won, uh, he won three Australian championships in a row here.

523
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,890
And then, and then, uh, I took him to Europe and he did well.

524
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,630
And then Red Bull picked him up and put him into a Red Bull junior team.

525
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,029
And he started racing cars a year.

526
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,049
He turned 15 in, um, in the UK.

527
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,490
It's, uh, my oldest son is, is, is playing NFL football.

528
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:11,009
And.

529
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,910
And watching him, I'm surprised by how nervous, you never saw danger out there when you're

530
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,109
playing.

531
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,349
You think of it as a parent, you suddenly, phew, don't do that.

532
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,289
You know, don't run the hair.

533
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,990
It's a, I find it really unnerving.

534
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:22,970
Yeah, totally.

535
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,690
You feel the same?

536
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,069
Yeah.

537
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:24,710
A hundred percent.

538
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,730
It's strange, isn't it?

539
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:25,950
Yeah.

540
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,410
Yeah.

541
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,470
And, uh, and it's difficult for them, you know, we, we can see it and we've experienced

542
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,970
it, but you can't really, you can't tell them because I think you're, uh, you're criticizing

543
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,130
them, but you can tell somebody else to tell them and they'll listen to it.

544
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,390
You know what I mean?

545
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,630
Now Jack's, Jack's, uh, I'm not sure how, how old your fellow, your young, young lad

546
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,609
is, but, but Jack's now 20.

547
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,650
So he'll listen to it, agree now it's sort of past that point, but it's still difficult

548
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,690
to watch as a parent, as I say, cause you know yourself what, uh, what can go wrong.

549
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,950
It's one of the great parenting, my lad Sam's 19 and, uh, it's sort of brilliant at one

550
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,450
level, isn't it?

551
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,829
You know, you clearly, world of motorsport or something that is right in your zone of

552
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,869
expertise, but they need to hear it from someone else.

553
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,109
And no matter what, you just have to, as soon as you realize that.

554
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,109
It's fine, isn't it?

555
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,650
There's a lot of pain if, uh, if you don't, um, uh, it's, uh, it's brilliant to see that,

556
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,349
that coming through.

557
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,430
You're, you're a working class boy from Brisbane.

558
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:22,470
I just, you know, not necessarily a school wasn't a hundred percent from you, from what

559
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,950
I read.

560
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,569
Um, what, what are the skills that allowed you post-sport?

561
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,750
A lot of athletes struggle in that next chapter.

562
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,390
You've gone on to incredible success.

563
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,430
What do you, what do you think helped, helped you in that part?

564
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,109
Um, I think the same, the same discipline that helped me with the sport.

565
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,049
Really recognizing one, you've got to recognize that sports over, and I think that's a lot

566
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,849
of people sort of can't move on.

567
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:52,349
They've never sort of planned for an exit of sport and most sports, if you get a decade

568
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:55,829
at the top of the sport, you've done, you've been pretty, pretty damn lucky.

569
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,849
And, you know, so thankfully I had some good people around me.

570
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:06,170
We've sort of made, we're able to sort of, to advise me a little bit better on that,

571
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,470
you know, even though you think you're never going to stop.

572
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,450
Um, who said to you, Hey, no, you, you broke your leg again at the end.

573
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,369
I broke my leg again.

574
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:17,450
That, that really had no, I'd, I'd planned to continue on that.

575
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,210
It was only when I couldn't, um, continue.

576
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:26,690
Um, and then I moved into a role with Honda as general manager of racing with them and

577
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,529
doing some things within the sport.

578
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:30,910
Um, so I'd moved, I'd transitioned.

579
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,809
So I was still involved with the sport, but not actually competing.

580
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,710
And I had an offer to come back and a bit like Schumacher come back after a few years

581
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,029
is that, you know, you probably went.

582
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,349
And through it as well, there's a two, three year period, you know, where you're still,

583
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:49,710
you know, you can still relate to what's going on and you still feel you can, you know, put

584
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,170
your shoes back on away from my case, put the helmet back on and be competitive.

585
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:58,450
And I knew that, I mean, I'd go, you'd have to go through that same withdrawal process

586
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,690
again, anyway, even if I went back on and I did it again, I was now physically capable

587
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,890
of riding, but I'd, um, I'd thankfully declined that, you know, I, I see, uh, give me a couple

588
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,950
of weeks to think about it.

589
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,430
And I, I actually declined it.

590
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,130
And that was the smartest move to be honest.

591
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,089
And then, and then I just transitioned into, into working with the team and then investments

592
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,910
and then, and then, which is, and then slowly sort of from about the mid two thousands more

593
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:30,009
into the aviation started to, to, to, uh, I guess started as a bit of a hobby dabble

594
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:30,670
in aviation.

595
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,970
And then there's now what she's grown into a big part of our business.

596
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:38,690
I read that, uh, you negotiated and you had a time on the bike, uh, a bonus structure

597
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,670
where it was all about.

598
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:40,390
Yeah.

599
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,809
You win and you get exponentially rewarded second.

600
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,829
It's a massive decline.

601
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:50,490
And, and from that moment on, I think you just kept winning and so you backed yourself

602
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:50,750
in.

603
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,230
I mean, I clearly had a negotiation ability, uh, even in those days.

604
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:55,670
Yeah.

605
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:00,329
And again, I think that's just understanding and backing yourself to a degree.

606
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:05,970
Um, but back, back most of the, I'm not sure what it's like in your sport, but back in,

607
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:09,869
in, in the motorsport, um, um, arena, especially back then.

608
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:15,849
I had win bonuses, second and thirds and, you know, um, we're negotiating contract fees

609
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,589
and so on like, Oh, well, let's remove the second and third bonuses.

610
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:22,849
And we'll put in big, uh, win bonuses, whether it be for championships or whether it be for

611
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:23,269
races.

612
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,890
And, you know, they're thinking, yeah, of course you're going to have no problem, you

613
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,670
know, cause there's less chance you're going to win that finish second or third, you know?

614
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,809
So, uh, and it doesn't motivate you any, you know, you don't go out there and think, Oh,

615
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:35,309
I've got to win.

616
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,029
Cause I'm going to earn a couple more dollars.

617
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,650
You know, you want to win cause you want to win.

618
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:38,890
Yeah.

619
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:39,769
But certainly.

620
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,009
Yeah.

621
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:47,569
It helped, um, it helped, uh, on, on the business sense on the business foundation for me of

622
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:51,930
understanding, you know, the fundamentals of, uh, how I can make things work for myself.

623
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,430
Yeah.

624
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,150
And I, I, uh, reference at the start about, you know, one of your spaces is, is commercial

625
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,769
aircraft and selling them around the world and, and sell more of those than I think anyone

626
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:02,809
else on the, on the planet.

627
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,509
I'm sure that's a sophisticated area to get into with, you know, people that are high

628
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,670
net worth and understand.

629
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,750
And deal making, how have you found that?

630
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,529
Oh, it's not, it's not easy, but again, it's, it's, uh, it's transitioned over a number

631
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:17,390
of years, of course.

632
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:23,950
Uh, I'm a partner in a company called Jetcraft, which as you say, we're the, we're the largest

633
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,309
traders of corporate aircraft.

634
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:32,309
So we buy, sell, we traditional broke, we help with financing, advise, um, the, the

635
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,150
whole box and die.

636
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,990
So we have 20 offices around the world.

637
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,250
So we've got some good people within the offices to help structure the deals and so on.

638
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:39,609
But yeah.

639
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,930
But the people want to deal with, you know, with, with myself or whatever.

640
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,549
So we'll structure the deal together and then, and then it'll be handed off to our legal

641
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:51,549
council or whoever to put it all together and their legal council.

642
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,170
But, you know, when we're talking, um, you know, we're, we're, we sell ultra low, um,

643
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,150
our sweet spot, I guess, is our ultra long range corporate aircraft.

644
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:06,869
So in Aussie dollars, we're talking up to a hundred plus million dollars space.

645
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:09,549
So, you know, so these, they're very successful people.

646
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:16,690
Well, corporations that we're dealing with, um, and so it's not easy, you know, you're

647
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,450
not pulling the wool over any of these guys' eyes very easily and nor do we want to, you

648
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,650
know, we want, we want a lot.

649
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,849
We've got along with the, it's in its 60th year, you know, I'm one of the partners in

650
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:27,009
it.

651
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,650
It's remained restructured essentially from 08.

652
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,549
Um, there's four partners in there.

653
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,569
Um, but, um, but we want your, we want to sell you one today.

654
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,069
We want to then my back off you.

655
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:41,369
In four or five years time, sell you another.

656
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:49,009
So we, we're, we're, we're a solid business and with, with, uh, with a solid, um, ethical

657
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,890
standard practice with goes along with it.

658
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,109
And, uh, and as you say, we've got some other businesses here in Australia that just go

659
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,190
along with the corporate, um, the corporate aviation thing.

660
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:02,150
And, and, you know, a good year in that space.

661
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,970
How many, how many aircraft do you, do you move in a good year?

662
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,589
On average, we do roughly a hundred aircraft.

663
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:08,849
So, you know.

664
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:18,819
We've, um, we're, let's say the past decade we've, we've, um, we've done, um, the past

665
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:24,980
decade, we've probably done, um, 1500 aircraft or so, you know, so it's not too bad, you

666
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,119
know?

667
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,059
So some years we're 80, some years we're a hundred, some, you know, but I mean, it's

668
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,400
not, it's not a bad little space.

669
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:36,779
Um, Mick, we, we share a mutual, uh, a friend who, uh, spent some time with you over in,

670
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,839
in Europe and, uh, one of my great old mates.

671
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,099
And, and I know you've, uh, got to know him and he said, it's always fascinating to catch

672
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:47,640
up with you that there's always eclectic people around McDool and you can come to lunch and

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,720
there could be the creator of Riverdance or, uh, someone from a Royal family somewhere.

674
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,019
Uh, he described you as a, as a, as a great connector of people.

675
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,960
Was that, were you like that as a young athlete or has it been the nature of your second part

676
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,380
of your life?

677
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,140
I think, um, I think a bit of both.

678
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,380
I recognized at that point in time, being a young, you know, growing up, enjoying bike

679
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,719
racing or, or sport.

680
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,820
You know, meeting people, you know, rather than, than shying away from meeting people,

681
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,280
I've sort of always been open to meet people.

682
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,659
And then I've been fortunate to meet people of other people.

683
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:26,000
And, and so, and for me, you know, networking's a load of garbage.

684
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,099
Friendship is everything.

685
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,099
And, um, you know, I've, I've been able to retain friendship with a lot of people.

686
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,980
And I think that's been the key.

687
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,780
And, um, and then you meet through those friendships, you meet other people and, and you meet people,

688
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,159
whether it be a different, a completely, as you say, whether it be Riverdance or whether

689
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,860
it be something else, but the, you know, the, the mindset's much the same, whether it be

690
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,920
a success in a multinational company or, or whatever, the, the disciplines really are

691
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,360
much aligned of what took you to the top of AFL, to be honest.

692
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,360
And I love it.

693
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,519
That's a brilliant, I love what you just said there, you know, networking's a load of rubbish,

694
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:03,920
but friendships is everything.

695
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,699
And that authenticity, we all know people who are fanatical networkers that, but you

696
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:12,239
never get a sense that there's anything tangible there, is it?

697
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,219
It's, and, and, and people get that pretty quickly, don't they, that there's a sense

698
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:20,800
and, and, and, and for you, that's just the nature of you is that you connect because

699
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,900
of the connection and nothing else.

700
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,159
Well, that's, that's really it.

701
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,079
We don't, at the end of the day, I don't want anything else.

702
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,599
It's just about, you know, one interested in, in their story, number one, and then if

703
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,860
something comes of it, but, but, but likewise, you know, they come to, if somebody comes

704
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,679
to Australia and Europe, um, you know.

705
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,480
They'll give you a call, hey, let's go and grab a, a beer or dinner or whatever.

706
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,239
And, and, and the same, the same if, uh, if I'm somewhere.

707
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:52,099
So, you know, we, whenever, you know, sometimes it's nice to just go somewhere and not, uh,

708
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:55,840
not catch up with anybody, but it's nice to be able to, to, to, to be able to go anywhere

709
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,539
in the world and be able to catch up with somebody and, and, and be shown a great time.

710
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,059
Is there someone that stands out to me that you think, God, that transition from sport

711
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:07,659
to commercial success here, was there a mentor or someone that helped you specifically along

712
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:07,900
the way?

713
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,679
I think there's been a few, but.

714
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:16,079
But, um, but without a doubt, um, a guy by the name of James Strong, he was, um, he was

715
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,500
CEO of Qantas when I met him, you know, met him at a racetrack, to be honest, and I was

716
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,719
at, uh, one of the, the Australian Grand Prix and, um, we became good, good buddies.

717
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,420
And then, um, we, we did some, some things together and then, uh, people like Bruce Matheson,

718
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:36,960
the publican, and then we've done a couple of things together and, uh, and just different,

719
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,019
you know, completely two different people.

720
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,820
But, I mean, it's a good to get a broad understanding of the way they think and really at the end

721
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,739
of the day, it's about having a go and backing yourself and, and understanding the product

722
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,500
that would you, what you, what you have.

723
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,920
And, uh, I understand, you know, to this day, still on the fitness, if you, if you jump

724
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,719
on a bike or you, you still got that competitive edge, you're still alive and well, from what

725
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,300
I hear, Mick, is that something you do daily to look after yourself?

726
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,980
I do, you know, I'm sure, you know, when, when sports been such a big, um, period of

727
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,300
your life that, uh.

728
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:15,500
Yeah, I, I enjoy sort of circulating a bit of blood, plus I don't want to rust, you know,

729
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,780
with all the, all the metal I still have in me, but I don't, honestly, I don't have that

730
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,440
much, but, uh, but no, I enjoy to continue to do it.

731
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,659
But yeah, I think, uh, I know who you're talking about, but yeah, cycling and cycling up hills

732
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:32,500
because there's, in Europe where we're based, uh, there's only hills around you.

733
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,599
So, uh, if you're not used to it, then it's difficult.

734
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,679
But I mean, when you're doing decades of riding up hills, it's, it's, it's not too bad.

735
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:44,219
And Mick, I'm fascinated in, um, passionate about what leadership looks like in different

736
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,340
spaces and, and sit down with, you know, your expertise in business and sport or someone

737
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,119
from the world of arts.

738
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:53,940
And a bit like you said there, you know, Bruce Matheson's expertise compared to the CEO of

739
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,159
Qantas, James Strong, is a different way of thinking, a different logic, but we see there's

740
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:01,500
a common sort of traits that people who are successful have, uh, and starting with this

741
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,679
idea of self-leadership, Mick, it's very hard to lead anyone else without a sense of

742
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,599
self-leadership.

743
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,860
Does that, does that make sense to you?

744
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:08,340
Yeah.

745
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,500
Well, 100%.

746
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:14,420
At the end of the day, delegations, you know, there's a lot of delegators out there.

747
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,840
And so you've got to lead and you've got to show your team what you're doing.

748
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,559
And I think that's where you're going with that, are you?

749
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm not sure, but I mean, it's, um, at the end of the day, it's up to you really.

750
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,099
And, um, nobody else is going to help you get there.

751
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:32,260
And, um, and likewise with the same with your team around you, you know, you've got to,

752
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,019
you've got to help, uh, encourage them to be part of the, part of the, of the process

753
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:38,960
and part of the team.

754
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,239
And you've got to have a bunch of team players and like-minded, uh, individuals.

755
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:49,280
So, so leadership, you know, I, I've, I've never really, you know, it comes, people talk

756
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,659
about it.

757
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,139
So I don't even think about it, you know, it's just what I do.

758
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,519
So it's not something that I, you know, I've got to be, you know, uh, an A type or whatever

759
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,780
they, you know, all this stuff.

760
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,659
It's like, what?

761
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,039
You know, I just get, get on and get it done, you know?

762
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,079
So I don't know about the, you know, I'm always thinking about something and what I've got

763
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,719
to be doing and what I want to be doing and where I want to go.

764
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,000
So, you know, there's very, you know, my wife probably doesn't like it that often,

765
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,599
but there's very, there's very little downtime for me as far as switching off.

766
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,519
And, um, but, but that's what I enjoy.

767
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,059
And that's, I guess, what's, what's made me be here talking with you.

768
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,420
And you, and you find that that's, that those passions are there and you, and you, you just

769
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,639
have a process of, I've got to get something done.

770
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,679
It's up to me.

771
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,059
Is there?

772
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,980
Well, it gets to a point where something has to be done anyway.

773
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,380
And as I say, like delegating, it's, it's difficult.

774
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,699
Um, you know, I delegate to the.

775
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,280
Right people, of course, but I mean, you've got to bring them along for the ride, but,

776
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,519
but you're always thinking, and I'm always wanting to do something.

777
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,980
I've always got something I feel like I should be doing.

778
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:55,579
Um, so just, you know, one day, one day I can imagine that I'll slow things down, but

779
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:58,760
never completely stop, but, uh, but I enjoy what I do.

780
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,920
And, um, um, so, so I'm always just thinking about what the, what's the next thing.

781
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,699
We see Mick, uh, you know, people with success with a consciousness.

782
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,960
It's about others in their environment, how they impact them.

783
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,099
And it seems to be the case for you that the people around you enjoy their time to catch

784
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,099
up with, with Mick.

785
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,860
Are you conscious around that, around having an impact positively in all the arenas you're

786
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
in?

787
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:29,579
Um, look, I, I'm not sure how to answer that, but, um, um, you know, I, I enjoy what I

788
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,579
enjoy.

789
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:37,039
I, if I don't enjoy it, I don't enjoy it, but, but, um, but I, you know, I don't, thankfully

790
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,719
I don't have a bunch of employees.

791
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,980
You know, Jetcraft is, is the biggest group.

792
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,300
There's probably about 70 odd in, in that, but they're global around the, around this.

793
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,840
I'm not interacting with each and every one of those.

794
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,980
Um, it's more the, the leadership team in that, um, uh, dealing with them.

795
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:01,639
Um, at, um, so, so the rest of it, my, my inner circle of staff, I guess, have been

796
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,679
with me for a long while, you know, which means we're all getting old, but, uh, but

797
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,599
I mean, but as far as friendship and that.

798
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,860
We're just, just normal, normal people.

799
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
We just get on and have fun.

800
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,420
If we're not having fun, we don't do it.

801
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:14,500
I love it, Mick.

802
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,820
And I love that it shows up just inauthentically in everything you do.

803
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,079
And it's your way of, of having great success.

804
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,619
I mean, we, you know, to achieve five Grand Prix's in a row, clearly you had a vision

805
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:29,420
for yourself of being world champion multiple times, and you need a team behind you to do

806
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:29,659
that.

807
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,260
Were you sophisticated with that team around, right?

808
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,360
You know, I'm riding for, on a Honda and I need you to fix that thumb brake and I've

809
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,519
got this vision and you need to come with me to.

810
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,699
To support that or?

811
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,880
One, 100%.

812
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,559
And the same thing, I've pulled the right team players together very quickly within

813
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,159
a couple of years, sort of got the right crew from, from other areas.

814
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,760
And they, they remained with me all the way through the career.

815
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,659
One of them still works for me in another area.

816
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:04,000
Um, uh, then Valentino Rossi then, um, took all my team and then he, he hung onto that

817
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,900
same team for a long while.

818
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,619
Was he your, did he come on the bike after you?

819
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:14,300
So he, I'd signed him to be my teammate in 2000 and then when I didn't come back and

820
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,059
then, um, so I was going to be right alongside him.

821
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:25,019
And then, um, it was, it would become evident, evident that I wasn't, wasn't able to compete

822
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:25,900
again in 2000.

823
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,840
So basically I stopped and then Honda, um, took over the program, but then my, cause

824
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,639
we were going to run an independent team beside Honda, but factory equipment and had a different

825
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,119
sponsor.

826
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,400
The sponsor pulled out because I didn't really know who Honda, who, uh, who Valentino, you

827
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,519
know, he's a world champion of the two 50, but I mean, he hadn't made his name in the

828
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,019
MotoGP arena.

829
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,420
And then, so, um, Honda put me in as general manager of the racing side of thing.

830
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,659
Um, my team all become Honda.

831
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,820
Um, my, my team became Valentino's team.

832
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:07,659
Um, and Nostra Azzurro, the beer sponsor come on board with, with the Italian and then that's

833
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:08,559
where it went from there.

834
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,280
So, so that was, um, so he transitioned that 99 was my last season.

835
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,659
And then 2000, he, he joined and then stayed with Honda until 2004 or five and then moved

836
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:23,440
on and then took some of the team, some of my team with him to another manufacturer.

837
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,360
And, uh, one of them, one of them left and one of them, he started working for me, which

838
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,219
he still does today.

839
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,079
Did you see something special in Valentino as a young lad?

840
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,579
Not, well, it was hard.

841
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:38,280
I was more fun.

842
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,860
I was still competing at that point in time.

843
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,179
So yeah, he was winning and he was doing well.

844
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:46,679
And I was looking, I, I, I was creating my own race team at that point in time.

845
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,900
And I was looking for the best guy around to, to be a, to be my teammate and then to

846
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,699
help with everything going forward.

847
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:57,940
And at some point in time I was going and whether it be two, three, four, five years

848
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,099
time, I was going to, to move on whether or not he stayed there as long as that anyway.

849
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:08,260
But he was, uh, he was the guy and, you know, I was able to, to, uh, convince him at that

850
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,019
time to come with me, um, because again, I was winning at that point in time.

851
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:16,699
I'd had, um, I had Honda supporting me.

852
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,219
So Honda was the, the, the bike to be on at the time.

853
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:24,980
So, um, so thankfully he seen something in, in wanting to go that way as well, but, but

854
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,400
equally he then ended up on the bike, what I was riding essentially with my crew.

855
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,719
So it was a good transition from the lower category into the, into the main game for

856
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:33,960
him.

857
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,260
And then he rewarded them with a bunch of world titles and, and he's gone.

858
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,659
On to be, uh, um, I think the, the, the highest winning, the winningest, um, uh, Grand Prix

859
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:50,840
winner, but not, I think, um, Agostini, Giacomo Agostini's still got one more world title

860
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,219
than him from, from the sixties and seventies.

861
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,960
Um, and we, we see, uh, another dimension we talk about people who have success like

862
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
you consistently, they're curious all the time.

863
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,840
They want to learn, they want to know what's going on.

864
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,420
And, and through that, that's how they constantly get better.

865
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,119
Does that resonate with you?

866
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,659
The idea of constantly trying to find that, that curiosity and things?

867
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:19,420
Um, yes, less so now, but, but yeah, without a doubt, trying to keep pushing yourself,

868
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,960
uh, when, especially back in the competition days, you keep pushing yourself to try and

869
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,820
find the, you know, you keep pushing that limit and pushing those, that line a little

870
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,719
bit further out.

871
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,079
So that, that, that gray area is, is, is very clear.

872
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,840
You know, the more you keep pushing yourself, they're clear of that.

873
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,719
That, that, that gray area becomes, and I think that's the same with everything.

874
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,260
The more you understand and the more you do, whether we just want to put into aviation

875
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,079
when I'm first in there and you're fumbling through things, you know, and you are fumbling

876
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,800
through things because you haven't done a lot of it in the first time, but after you've

877
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,000
done it a hundred times, it's, you know, it's pretty second nature.

878
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,559
And, and I think that's the same thing as what you're saying, but, uh, but you keep

879
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,739
pushing through, you keep wanting to understand more and more and more, and, and that's just

880
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:05,099
called being an old fart, I guess, with experience.

881
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:05,280
Yeah.

882
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,960
Some people haven't got that mindset though, Mika.

883
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,019
Yeah.

884
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:08,079
Yeah.

885
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:08,099
Yeah.

886
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:10,739
They hit a hurdle and they're not prepared to go through that.

887
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,880
We are fumbling around in the, in the day and obviously you just do it.

888
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,820
I don't think you even consciously, uh, think about it.

889
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,260
I think it just seems to be second nature to you.

890
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,000
And it's, I'm, I'm always interested in, in that we see a lot of really consistent in

891
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,420
how they communicate with people as part of their success and communicating with, with

892
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,679
Clary, even just in, you know, I've been chasing you around the world.

893
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:36,420
Every time I text you, you're in Bahrain or Monaco, it's a, it's a, it's a back in

894
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,420
Queensland or over the world.

895
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,099
But you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

896
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:38,300
you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

897
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,880
you're very quick.

898
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,500
You always communicate clearly.

899
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,400
Is that, has that been something that's been part of you?

900
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,500
Yeah, I think that's, I've, I've also found with, you know, that's also been something,

901
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,159
you know, it's a pet peeve of mine that people don't get back to you or whatever, but also

902
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,940
I've found, and I'm not putting myself in that basket, but I mean, successful people

903
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,059
come back to you quickly.

904
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,800
Although they come back, they say, Hey, I'm busy at the moment, but I'll come back to

905
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,099
you here.

906
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,400
You know, at least you know where you stand rather than just being left out on the limb

907
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,900
where you don't hear, you don't get a return.

908
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:10,159
But, but I, I actually didn't, um, I didn't answer your question previously about the

909
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,719
team and communicating with the team and Honda, but we were certainly working on the same

910
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:14,099
page.

911
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:14,460
Yeah.

912
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:19,780
You know, I wasn't an engineer, but I communicate to the, to my chief engineer who then communicate

913
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,340
and then we'd have a debrief with the Japanese engineers because you'd have people, you'd

914
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:29,699
have Michelin back, back in those days, Michelin, you know, tyre chemists, tyre, tyre engineers,

915
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,820
you know, suspension engineers, carburation engineers, you know.

916
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,019
Electronic engineers, you'd be debriefing.

917
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,059
So you've got to be able to communicate and you've got to piece them all together and make

918
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:43,920
them feel like we're on a winning team because even though it's an individual sport, it is

919
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,159
a, it's still a, it's still a we, you know, we're doing this and we're, we're winning

920
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,300
and, uh, and we've got to make everyone feel part of that team.

921
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,340
And, and I think that's one of the, the things that sport teaches you in general is one punctuality.

922
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,900
That's why I went back to that.

923
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,260
Yeah.

924
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,099
And, and, and, you know, cause you can't show up five minutes late for kickoff, you know,

925
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:03,880
you can't show up five minutes late.

926
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,320
Five minutes late for a practice session or a race, you know, you, you finish.

927
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,039
So, and it's pretty easy to keep that going through.

928
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:14,619
And then, and then, um, and likewise with, with your team, you know, you've got to be

929
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:15,820
playing with your team members.

930
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,119
You've, they've got to know they're going to be able to rely on you.

931
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:19,780
And likewise, you can rely on them.

932
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:23,920
And I think mixed sports people really underestimate the skillset they get out of that professional

933
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,539
part of their life where you're totally obsessed with making sure you're not going to go, well,

934
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,900
one of those engineers lets you down.

935
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,579
You're not sitting here as a five time world champion.

936
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,380
So if you don't communicate clearly.

937
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:33,880
Mm.

938
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,719
To a Japanese engineer on a specific part of your bike, he can't support that process

939
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,239
for you.

940
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,099
And, and, you know, in, in the world of football, one teammate is having an off day.

941
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,300
That's enough for you to, to not be successful.

942
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,400
So I think that, as you said, you know, that skillset applies to clearly what you've done

943
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,360
in aviation and other areas of your life.

944
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:57,019
We, we see more than ever now that people are aware of collaboration as a, as a much

945
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:00,539
more important thing in, in every area of their life to get stuff done, you need to

946
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:01,460
collaborate more effectively.

947
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,039
Has that been true for you?

948
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,840
Yeah, without a doubt, you know, you can't do anything by yourself at all.

949
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,900
So you, you've certainly, you've got ideas and you've got, um, the bits and bobs, but

950
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,820
I mean, at the end of the day, the day you have to rely on some, some other people at

951
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,619
some point in time.

952
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,380
And, and you've got to, you've got to want to, you've got to have them buy into what

953
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,519
you, you, you're doing.

954
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,780
So, you know, different people have different ways of making that work for them.

955
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,500
But, um, you know, I just do what I do.

956
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,159
And, um.

957
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,840
And as I say, some people, the majority of the people must like it because they've worked

958
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,280
for me for a long while, but the rest of it, uh, um, the rest of it, you know, you're not

959
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,599
going to please everyone all the time, but, but having people buy into what I'm doing,

960
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,260
if they don't buy in, they're not, they're not part of the show.

961
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:51,719
And it's a good sign, isn't it?

962
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,980
When you've got long held people who are clearly happy in their environment, you're

963
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,019
doing, doing something right.

964
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,860
Um, a couple of final questions, Megan, thanks for taking the time, uh, to do this.

965
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,860
So who's been the, the, the great leader for you in your life?

966
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:11,260
Um, good question.

967
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,320
I don't, I've never really thought of it to be honest.

968
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,599
So, uh, um, yeah, I, I'm just inspired by people who have, you know, back in the

969
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,599
sporting days, you know, it was people like, um, you know, the, the, you know, I'll

970
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,019
keep it Australian, but your people like Greg Normans, who was sort of number one for a

971
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:33,639
long while, people who can do things continuously, you know, that, um, because

972
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,800
it's, it's never easy to win something.

973
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:35,980
Yeah.

974
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,340
Or to be the top of the game, but I mean, to stay at the top is, is it, you know, you

975
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,179
touched on it earlier.

976
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:45,079
It's a little bit more difficult because you've got to keep pushing yourself and the drive

977
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,139
you have to keep maintain that drive.

978
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:52,360
And so, and then people, you know, successful people in business, and I'm not meaning, um,

979
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,500
there's a lot of people who have been very successful in different areas who aren't in

980
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,219
the limelight.

981
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,639
And, uh, you know, so people who have achieved what they've set out to, to achieve and built,

982
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,800
built something for themselves, whether it be.

983
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,079
Um, uh, business wise or sport wise, but, but there, there's sort of people who inspire

984
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,880
me to, to, um, to, to, to go on and do good things.

985
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,039
And that's the same, um, um, uh, there was a tennis player back in the day, Peter, what

986
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:21,559
was his name?

987
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:25,119
Sampras, you know, he was, he was somewhere here cause he was the man remember back in

988
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,880
the nineties, you know, he was just dominant.

989
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,360
And, uh, you know, so you'd look at him and go, wow, you know, how does he just do this

990
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,400
week in, week out, you know, every, every grand slam he's.

991
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,960
So there's plenty of people like that.

992
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,380
He's like, you know, that's, that's inspirational.

993
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,940
And, um, but I mean, the rest of it, as I say, I couldn't answer the question because

994
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,119
I never really thought about it.

995
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:49,139
But clearly, you know, those, you know, and the way of your world, you probably spent

996
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:53,280
some time with the great white shark and, and, and did you, did you find that you were

997
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,099
learning from them and just see there was some, some clues that came out of that sustained

998
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:57,820
success or.

999
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,699
And that's, that's been the best thing.

1000
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,079
And then you, you'd be the same, but you, you meet like-minded people and there's a

1001
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:05,960
lot of, a lot of success.

1002
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,840
There's a lot of similarities there, whether it be a different discipline in the sport

1003
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,340
or, or even in the business, the same sort of disciplines are there, which again, you're

1004
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,139
taught playing sport and that's why sports so good for, you know, kids rather than getting

1005
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:22,780
on their iPhones or PlayStations, you know, just teaches you just basic life skills.

1006
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,900
And, but, you know, you take it to another level if you want to take it to that level.

1007
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,099
And there's a lot of similarities between, you know, somebody, um, creating a great company

1008
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,760
and the leadership, but what he needs to do that.

1009
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:34,940
Yeah.

1010
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,960
And the disciplines that he needs.

1011
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,760
He needs to do that.

1012
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,539
And the passion and desire is the same as, as what, you know, it takes a good football

1013
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:44,219
or a good tennis player or a good motorcyclist or whatever.

1014
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:44,980
Yeah.

1015
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,179
And you've probably articulated a bit, the passion of where this conversation comes from.

1016
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:54,099
It's what we do in our leadership space is bringing together people from different disciplines,

1017
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:58,860
taking them out of their silos to learn that crown, whether it's a conductor of an orchestra

1018
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,480
who's in front of 500 people, who's the top of their game.

1019
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,639
And, you know, you miss a beat, Ben Northey's in one of our spaces, who's legendary

1020
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,239
conductor with the same mindset that Greg Norman had to be on top of the world with

1021
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,599
someone who's, uh, started an entrepreneurial space from scratch and doing, and we love

1022
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,719
the, we're fascinated by where that comes across, Mick.

1023
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,900
And, and I suspect you're going to answer this, the final question the same way, because

1024
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,920
I get the sense you just do stuff, Mick, and you, and it works because you know yourself

1025
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,500
really well, but in the spirit of collaboration and, you know, I've already hinted at a few

1026
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,760
of your collaborations with great successful people before, but have you ever looked and

1027
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,260
thought, God, on that project, that's the person I'd love to, to connect or collaborate

1028
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:41,000
with because that would, uh, would make it come to fruition or, or you did, I get the

1029
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,820
feeling you'd probably just go and do it if it, if the thought arrived.

1030
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:47,079
No, well, there's been a lot of mess ups, I can assure you as well.

1031
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:50,840
You don't win every match, you don't win every race.

1032
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,579
So, but, um, you know, I've been fortunate as you'd say to, to have met a bunch of good

1033
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:01,679
people and I've done a few things with some, um, some, some great, uh, successful people.

1034
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:01,739
Yeah.

1035
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,719
And likewise, the main shareholder in the Jetcraft group, you know, he's probably the

1036
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:07,480
world's best guy.

1037
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:11,940
That's why the, that's why the company Jetcraft is what it is, you know, so you learn a lot

1038
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,980
off somebody like him.

1039
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,360
Um, so I've been fortunate in that.

1040
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:20,480
The other spaces where I've played, where I don't know anything, um, is, uh, just teaches

1041
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,579
you to stay in your lane.

1042
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:28,099
So, so, um, but, uh, but, uh, to, to, to who would I like and what business would I like,

1043
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,159
you know, at the moment?

1044
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,679
Um, uh,

1045
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,599
again, if I don't know much about it, I don't know whether I'd even want to sort of, okay,

1046
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,579
let's go and do this.

1047
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,119
And Hey, can you give me a hand here?

1048
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,199
You know, I don't think that really works, but, but so thankfully, you know, my, the

1049
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,599
passions said, whether it just be investment, we've got the right investment team with the

1050
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,619
aviation, which is to set earlier, started as a passion and then has grown into a, into

1051
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,559
a, a, a, a solid business.

1052
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,820
Um, I've been fortunate enough to fall into, into place with the right players.

1053
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,480
And, and, and prepared.

1054
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,920
Then to stay in your lane and say, this is what I know.

1055
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Well, that's right.

1056
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,699
And then, and then, and then if I need some, um, external advice and I'm not afraid to

1057
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:13,000
ask for it, I said, final question, but do you still fly?

1058
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,059
Do you still jump in?

1059
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,860
Not as much as I like.

1060
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,159
Yeah.

1061
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:17,780
But I, I still fly helicopters.

1062
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,460
I've, um, I'll go and do a renewal probably next week, a biannual flight test.

1063
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,880
Um, but, but as you say, like I was just saying, I'm here, there and everywhere.

1064
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,119
So, so that restricts the amount of flying.

1065
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:30,800
I'm doing a lot of flying as a passenger.

1066
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,599
I'm like, I'm on a plane every other day, but I'm not, um, I'm not physically flying.

1067
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,699
I haven't flown a plane since the two thousands, but a helicopter, I've got two and a half

1068
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:45,380
thousand hours in a helicopter and still enjoy flying a helicopter.

1069
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,860
But, um, but it's really only again, a passion.

1070
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,380
So you just become Mick, the pilot and you forget about everything else.

1071
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,380
So that's what I enjoy about, about that.

1072
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,199
And, uh, and it's the ultimate off-road vehicle.

1073
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,159
You know, we can pretty much pull up at a pub or you can pull up on a beach, stop here,

1074
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:01,380
there.

1075
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,440
And everywhere there is a plane, you need a landing strip.

1076
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,019
Mick, it's a fascinating story of, uh, of courage and success and sporting success and

1077
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:10,139
success in life in general.

1078
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,460
And, uh, I learned a lot just from sitting down in front of you today.

1079
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,500
So thanks for taking the time in your, in your busy world.

1080
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,179
Really appreciate it.

1081
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,719
Pleasure, Luke.

1082
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,500
Great to speak with you.

1083
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:17,940
Thanks, Mick.
