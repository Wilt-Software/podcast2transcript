1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:13,880
If you invest in these young people and you've made them feel good about themselves and you've found positive things and you've connected with them on a personal level,

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,460
you know their family and you know their mind, you know what's going on in their life.

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:29,519
Then when you do have to turn the screws and challenge them, I guess I kind of created an atmosphere where be good to them, positive to them, where they don't want to let you down.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,520
You know, you're in a tough stretch and some of your seniors or captains come by, you know, hey coach, man, we got to be better, man.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,460
Well, if you can get it coming from there, man, I think you're more than halfway there.

6
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,380
I always used to say, I used the phrase, can you get a group to take ownership of itself?

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,000
That is 85% of it.

8
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,280
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creativity.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,579
Creating a world of collaboration.

11
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:11,079
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture and the arts who come together to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

12
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,040
Dr. Troy Flanagan, Vice President of Performance for the Milwaukee Bucks.

13
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:21,040
I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that leadership group.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,239
The significance of their work and how much it's really about helping others.

15
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,620
It made me think, what else could I be doing?

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
And I approached our own.

17
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:37,760
And within a few weeks, we'd raised $5 million to try and solve obesity in the underprivileged community in Milwaukee.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,359
So that's one spark that that leadership course has caused to contribute and leave the world as a better place.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
Umrah Omer, founder of Safari Doctors.

20
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,739
It defines the word creativity for me.

21
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,420
The ability to see connections where none seem to exist.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,739
And I think that's the magic of education.

23
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:11,259
Definitely not my usual, you know, workshop panels like humanitarian spaces, but more of an intentional dissection of leadership.

24
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:26,400

29
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,639
If you ask anyone in the world of college basketball about Mike Bray, you'll hear a common theme.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,599
He's one of the most respected and most successful coaches of his generation.

31
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,419
Mike inherited a program.

32
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,280
It had been absent from the NCAA tournament for a decade and turned it into a perennial contender.

33
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,120
His impact on the game is the stuff of legend.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:18,379
The all-time winningest coach in Notre Dame history, he guided the Irish to 13 NCAA tournament appearances, three Sweet 16s, back-to-back Elite Eights and a historic AACC championship.

35
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,340
And across 23 seasons, his team played with a signature confidence, freedom and resilience, an extension of the man that was leading them.

36
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,560
Beyond the wins, Mike's impact.

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,639
Mike extends far beyond the court, a mentor to countless players, a leader in the coaching community.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,000
He's helped raise millions for Coaches vs. Cancer, served as president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and built a reputation as one of the most likable figures in the game.

39
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:52,860
After more than two decades leading Notre Dame, Mike has taken on a new challenge, joining the Atlanta Hawks coaching staff as an assistant coach in June 2023.

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,180
Mike, they say you're the loosest coach in America and one of the finest basketball minds.

41
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,199
Great to have you on the show today.

42
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,620
Thank you.

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,699
Luke, it's great to be with you.

44
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,819
I'm honored.

45
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,819
And, you know, you can be a lot looser when you're assistant now instead of a head coach.

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,800
You know, my blood pressure is a lot better as an assistant.

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,699
Hey, Mike, when I hear that back, it just sounds like a full life.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,379
When you hear all of your history read back to you, what's the feeling that comes to you?

49
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:28,399
You know, I look and go, you know, as I was listening to you, I'm flattered and I have been one lucky dude.

50
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,480
I've been I've had great mentors and I know we're going to get into that.

51
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,920
And and and I've been able to get to some amazing programs and universities.

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,379
And what's neat about this NBA experience is I was in the game 40 years and I felt the last two years like it's professional development.

53
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:56,399
I'm learning again because the NBA is a different style than college and it's run differently.

54
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,560
And I have been.

55
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:05,579
I've been like energized again to be learning about the game of basketball in year 45 in the game.

56
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,560
Well, I love that, Mike.

57
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,519
We might just go straight down to that road as a jumping off point.

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,579
As you said, 45 years of history and your reputation has an extraordinary history to it.

59
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,399
But can you tell us a bit about the difference from coaching NBA professional athletes to to the college athletes you spent your life with?

60
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
You know, the question I got last year.

61
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,899
In my first year with the Hawks was what's the what's the biggest difference?

62
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:36,100
The neat thing about the NBA, it's it's really all basketball.

63
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:43,139
You are digging in the college game here in the States is only 25 percent coaching the game.

64
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:58,259
And the other 75 percent is recruiting and now raising money for name, image and likeness and being an ambassador for the university, which which I enjoyed and I loved and respected at Notre Dame.

65
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,620
But to dig into the game X and O wise, you're not recruiting.

66
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,879
The front office is handling the acquisition of talent in the NBA.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,579
You're not raising money.

68
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,800
The owner certainly has got plenty of money if he wants to spend it.

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
And so it's from that point of view.

70
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,680
The other side of it was I don't know how many guys said, well, why would you want to coach in the NBA?

71
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,779
And you hear this through the States because those guys don't want to be coached.

72
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,879
They've made all their money.

73
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,379
They don't want to be coached.

74
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,199
I have found that to be completely untrue.

75
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,920
And I have been energized seeing our particular roster just want to be engaged.

76
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,240
How can I be better?

77
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,079
And this is their craft.

78
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:51,379
You know, this level of athlete has been kind of probably tracking toward this since 12 or 13 years old.

79
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,699
And they're very serious about their craft.

80
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,300
And so I have found them to be amazingly receptive.

81
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,879
To coaching.

82
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,939
And that old wives' tale that people say in the States, oh, they don't want to be coached.

83
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,980
They got their money.

84
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,360
Not true.

85
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,139
Not true.

86
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,180
Well, nice to spell one of those rumors out off the top.

87
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,360
And I want to dive back into your history.

88
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,980
And you mentioned the great mentors you've had.

89
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,439
Your story starts well before Notre Dame.

90
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,699
You grew up in a family of elite athletes and educators.

91
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,339
Played college basketball at Northwestern State and George Washington.

92
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,740
And you learned the game.

93
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,720
You played the game under the legendary Morgan Wooden at DeMartha.

94
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,439
And it sounds like a pretty idyllic upbringing in the sport that you love.

95
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,439
Can you go back and tell us a bit about all of that?

96
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,459
I was so fortunate when I think about my mentors.

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,839
And I start with my parents who were both educators.

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,360
You know, the dinner table talk was what they did in their class or with their teams.

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,379
And a shout out to my mother because she came to Melbourne, Australia in 1956

100
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,579
and swam for the U.S. Olympic team.

101
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,899
And she was an Olympian in Melbourne.

102
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:07,199
So Australia has always been very special in our family's heart because mom had pictures

103
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,300
and videos of the training facilities were a lot different in 56.

104
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,220
If you can imagine, Luke, I look at the videos sometimes and it was just amazing.

105
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,379
But they were both educators and teachers and coaches.

106
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,759
And what struck me was their students many times came up to me and would say,

107
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,699
without my parents.

108
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,259
Man, I love your mom.

109
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,579
She's awesome.

110
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,679
You know how she's helped me or your dad's been great.

111
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,659
And I was like, you know, I want to do that.

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,659
I want to have that impact on young people.

113
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,120
And I think it started there in the home family of educators.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I played for Morgan Wooten at DeMartha High School, who he's in the Hall of Fame.

115
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,440
But he was truly an educator.

116
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,179
Yes, he was a good basketball mind, but he was an educator.

117
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,500
He was a he was someone who helped young people.

118
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,940
And I was so fortunate, Luke, that I played for him.

119
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,039
And then when I finished playing at George Washington University,

120
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,419
I came back and coached with him.

121
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,399
And his selling point to me was because I almost took I almost took a college

122
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,860
graduate assistant job at GGW.

123
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,220
And he said, you know, you need to come back with me because if you want to really do this,

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,419
you need to have your own team.

125
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,820
I'm going to give you the JV.

126
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,419
And at 22, I had the junior varsity.

127
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,120
At DeMartha High School, I taught six classes of history.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
Catholic high schools, they wear you out.

129
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
They don't pay anything.

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,039
We ran bingos on the weekend to raise money.

131
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,320
You know, the Catholics are unbelievable about how they can raise money.

132
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,620
And I learned to work my backside off, helped him and was there for five seasons before

133
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,419
I went to Duke.

134
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,460
So my DeMartha experience as a young person around Coach Wooten and then as his right

135
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,379
hand man, you know, he had an unbelievable.

136
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:07,580
And he was truly an educator, a positive guy, a an educator who made young people feel good

137
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,419
about themselves.

138
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,759
And it sounds like that's been a theme for you across your life.

139
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,919
And I love these conversations because often people can pinpoint they are lucky enough

140
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,580
to have someone in their life like you described Coach Wooten as and or a great educator or

141
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,460
teacher that really was a sliding door moment who just believed in them and invested in

142
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,659
them.

143
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,200
Has that been something you've been conscious of the amount of young people that have come

144
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
through your world that you can really change someone's life?

145
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Yeah, there's no question.

146
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,840
I've been so lucky starting as a high school educator and, of course, being around my parents

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,539
who were high school educators.

148
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,759
I've always felt, even though I was a college coach at a high profile university, to kind

149
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:57,620
of be that teacher and confidence giving educator that I witnessed with my parents and certainly,

150
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
with Coach Wooten.

151
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,419
My mom used to have a saying, you know, make them feel like a million bucks.

152
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:09,159
You know, if you can do that with your young people, and I used to laugh at it, I think

153
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:16,820
back now, and it's really kind of how you've tried to work with young people and help them

154
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,320
and help them to be more confident.

155
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,379
Well, it's interesting, Mike, isn't it?

156
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,679
Because sometimes your reputation in sport and I certainly grew up in an era where coaches

157
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,679
were pretty hard.

158
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,200
They were pretty, you know, I would say mean-spirited at times and you got abused and if you could

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,379
cope with that, that was a generation that we sort of grew up with here in Australia.

160
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,019
But the term, the loosest coach in America, but loose is really your calmness under pressure

161
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,059
and you see you on the sidelines.

162
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:48,960
There's chaos going on everywhere, but you've got this calm, relaxed demeanor.

163
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,320
Is that just you or did you work on that?

164
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,720
Well, there's no question that sometimes you are having to fake that.

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,940
Let's be honest, Luke.

166
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,220
When it's hitting the fan during some times or you've lost three in a row and I was inside,

167
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,639
you may be a lot different, but I always felt what I projected was going to really affect

168
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,899
my group and the crowd and the whole bit.

169
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,519
And I think when I came into that, we were talking with the media after a game once and

170
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,559
uptight, are you nervous?

171
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,440
And they were, it's a big game or I said, look, I'm the loosest coach in America.

172
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,980
Well, that thing ran, I mean, it went viral.

173
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,600
And so I've run, I ran with it.

174
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,559
There is no question that there's days I was extremely firm with my group, probably behind

175
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,639
closed doors.

176
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:49,659
I never wanted to embarrass anyone in a setting of, certainly a setting of 15,000 people and

177
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,039
on ESPN.

178
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,720
Never wanted a young person to be put in that spot.

179
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,259
Yeah.

180
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,159
You know, you, you had some standards and you had your firmness and you had to show those

181
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,159
days.

182
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,879
And there were days where you knew you had to be a little edgy and I would wake up that

183
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,840
morning and go, son of a gun is one of those days I'm all have to do it.

184
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,519
And three o'clock was practice and I'd work myself up to it and, uh, and be a pain for

185
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,620
maybe 30 minutes of a two hour practice and see if you could get a message.

186
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,679
But I never let them, I never let them leave on a bad note.

187
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,399
I was always trying to find a way to end it positively and, and end it with hope.

188
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,639
Especially if you've lost a couple and young people are searching and we're all wondering

189
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,639
and we're dying for a win.

190
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,500
How do we leave them with some hope and some confidence and that type of thing.

191
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,299
But, uh, yeah, the loosest coach thing is stuck and what the heck I run with it now.

192
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:55,399
The worst things to be known as, uh, I want to go back to your mom's wisdom, make people

193
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,799
feel like a million bucks and, you know, I love the opportunity to sit next to a legendary

194
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,480
coach like you.

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,820
So that when is it for you, if you build all that confidence and you build all that trust,

196
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,159
when you need to be hard, you've got a lot of equity in that relationship and people

197
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,899
are going to take that feedback a lot better because you've invested in them over the time.

198
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,159
Is that sort of a way of framing the way you've gone about it?

199
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,100
Luke, you nailed it right there.

200
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,240
If you invest in these young people and you've made them feel good about themselves.

201
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah.

202
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,580
And you found positive things and you've connected them, connected with them on a personal level

203
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,940
and you're at, you know, you know, their family and you know, their mind, you know, what's

204
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,279
going on in their life.

205
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,340
Then when you do have to turn the screws and challenge them, I guess I kind of created

206
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,360
an atmosphere where be good to, you know, be good to them, positive to them where they

207
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,240
don't want to let you down, where they feel bad when they let you down and you could show

208
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,019
a little bit of, you know, you kind of let me down tonight, fellows, and if you have

209
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,559
established some leadership and, you know, that can permeate through a locker room and

210
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,860
you have trust with your guys and my assistant, I used to have assistants say, you're too

211
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
good to them.

212
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,080
You're going too easy on them.

213
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,620
There's a bigger picture here.

214
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,240
This is a long road.

215
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,740
This is a long road.

216
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,080
And so, you know, I kind of, when I think back, guys, you're in a tough spot.

217
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,759
You're in a tough stretch.

218
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,519
And some of your seniors or captains come by, you know, before head coach, man, we gotta

219
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,639
be better, man.

220
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,620
Well, if you can get it coming from there, man, I think you're more than halfway there,

221
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,179
you know, with a group that has, I always used to say, I use the phrase, can you get

222
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,899
a group to take ownership of itself?

223
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,179
That is 85% of it.

224
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,240
Can they take ownership of themselves?

225
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,860
And I used to add on that phrase and I use it at coaches clinics.

226
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,440
Now, who's selling your stuff coach, when you ain't around, who's selling my stuff?

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,980
Do I have the relationships with my senior captains who, when I ain't around or I leave

228
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,519
the locker room and I've challenged them, they go, he's right, man.

229
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,759
He's right.

230
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,340
If they give it this one or roll their eyes, then we probably got a problem, you know,

231
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,259
but who, who's selling your stuff and have you nurtured those relationships where those

232
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:24,379
people.

233
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,879
Can help take control of the ownership, uh, of a group and might the evidence is there,

234
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,179
the sustained success you enjoyed over a long period of time.

235
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:39,620
And you voted the national coach of the year on a, on a couple of occasions in your words.

236
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,639
And I, I suspect you're gonna be too humble to, to delve too deeply, but putting all that

237
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,980
together, what was the thing that enabled you to have that continued sustained success?

238
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,399
You know, I, I think you have to have great energy every day.

239
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,899
And then how do you pace yourself?

240
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,500
I got better at it as I got a little more experienced as a head coach.

241
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,259
How can I be at my best from four to six when we practice this afternoon and you know, in

242
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,680
a college job, you're putting out a lot of fires, you're recruiting, you're doing, there's

243
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,559
things you're doing maybe during the day, but when you get to four o'clock, you better

244
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,799
be mentally ready.

245
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,640
And there are days when you're thoroughly wiped out, exhausted, and maybe not in the

246
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
best of places.

247
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:23,759
Yeah.

248
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:23,799
Yeah.

249
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:23,839
Yeah.

250
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:23,859
Yeah.

251
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:23,880
Yeah.

252
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:23,940
Yeah.

253
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

254
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,039
Yeah.

255
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,099
Yeah.

256
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,119
Yeah.

257
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,140
Yeah.

258
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,180
Yeah.

259
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,579
Buddy, you have to fake it.

260
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,380
Those are the days you got to come out and where they actually look at you like, how

261
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,920
in the hell is he doing that today?

262
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:37,220
Now you go pass out as soon as they leave the gym, you can go pass out in your office.

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,619
But when they're, when you're up in front of them and they're feeling you, you know,

264
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,299
and, and I, I always tried, you know, it was interesting.

265
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,180
Your guys are stretching before.

266
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:54,240
I always 15 guys, it's easy to do 12 guys really on a college team, bump every one of

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,380
them.

268
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,240
And while they're stretching, we have a five minute stretch and they're on, they're doing

269
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,660
a thing.

270
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,799
Jimmy, what's up?

271
00:17:58,819 --> 00:17:59,220
How are we doing?

272
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,519
How'd you have that Tesco today?

273
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,299
Nothing bad.

274
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,140
You know, you good.

275
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,900
You're going to smile today or you're going to play any defense today.

276
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,059
Oh, coach, what are you talking?

277
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,220
You know, just bump everybody before we get to the group huddle and we get into our stuff,

278
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,279
just kind of touching everybody up so that you have that personal thing.

279
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,319
And, and, uh, uh, and that, you know, that was always on my, always on my mind.

280
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,319
Yeah, brilliantly said.

281
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,880
And that, that personal touch, it makes a lot of sense.

282
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,819
Could you sum up your coaching philosophy, uh, in a, in a, in a few sentences?

283
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,759
Is there a way to, to articulate it?

284
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:35,559
Yeah.

285
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,200
And it, and I'll give a coach Wooten, Morgan Wooten, we would work his basketball camp

286
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,519
and I was a little young to understand this, but he used the phrase, we were working with

287
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,079
young people.

288
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,019
He said, Hey, be the kind of coach you'd want your own son and daughter to play for.

289
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:57,180
And I thought to myself, my son played college football, my daughter played volleyball.

290
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,519
And when I think, and I use that in coaching clinics now, and it's, and it, it hits home.

291
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,480
You can tell when you say it, the high school educator coaches, like, you know, be the kind

292
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,319
of coach you want your own son and daughter to play for.

293
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:19,039
And, and if you kind of start with that basis, I think you're going to handle young people

294
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,539
the right way.

295
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,960
Uh, find power.

296
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,180
Positive things, encouragement, those types of things.

297
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,059
And that was a Morgan Wooten back in 1975.

298
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,019
And I still hang on to it.

299
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,380
It's a, it's a great one line statement, isn't it?

300
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,380
Because it sums up so much, doesn't it?

301
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,480
And, and I want to jump into, you know, as you said, your kids go and play college sport

302
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,559
and you get to see from the other angle, tell us about your parenting style as someone who's

303
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,420
lived that world.

304
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,799
How did you allow them to have the space?

305
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,400
achieve their dreams you know my son played college football at the university of buffalo

306
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,660
he's a high school coach down in florida now and you know when he played when he was growing up

307
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:10,140
and he played byo bad he played everything i just made a point to be really in the background

308
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,940
low-key sit at the top of the bleachers and not bring anything up unless he asked me and and

309
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,180
certainly the great blessing was that he played football and i couldn't screw him up because i

310
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,339
don't know football but i have i've dealt with a lot of parents you know handling parents is part

311
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:36,680
of it in in high school and certainly college the parent situation is part of it and i think i have

312
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,140
a lot of experience with it many very good ones some that were nightmares but you got to manage

313
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,920
it because you're managing the young person and one time

314
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:56,039
i slipped into bad parent so my son was a tight end h-back blocking tight end they never threw to

315
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,420
him because he couldn't really run but he could block his backside off so one summer he's home

316
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,759
and we're sitting there at dinner i go hey kyle you ever talk to your like tight end coach that

317
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,960
maybe they put you out in the flat now i'm going to be an expert right now i'm going to be

318
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,519
put you out in the flat just pop it to you for a little five yard out and he turns me goes dad

319
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,920
i got my scholarship

320
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,220
scholarship because i blocked just shut up and i go lesson learned i'm back in my right parent

321
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,559
mode i'm going to shut up but even i creeped into that world yeah why don't they throw to

322
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:36,200
you a little bit he's like dad i'm a blocker that's the only time i'll ever play isn't that

323
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,240
a great story my and i love that you said the one moment that you slipped because you know i'm going

324
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,920
to be a little more blunt i i see crazy parents at junior sport yeah who do ridiculous things

325
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,059
and i it makes me sad because i just see the impact it has on their kids and they take away

326
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:57,160
the joy of sport now they're well-meaning like you and i and and we love our sport and we love

327
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,819
our kids but you're so subtle and and i hope i've parented the same way with my four it's exactly

328
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,599
how i've tried to it's like this is your life you don't need you've got coaches you've got people

329
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,000
around you i don't need to be your coach i want to be your dad i want to be uh in the background

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,900
like you sitting there and being supportive but you just see the parents through what they're

331
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,259
i think has been loving to their kids but they're really micro managing them they're over the top

332
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:27,640
they're screaming from the sidelines and it seems pretty destructive to me mike i i think it's a bit

333
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,000
of an issue we've got that i don't know how to put the genie back in the bottle but i think you

334
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,220
probably answered it before it's really a problem luke i mean it it's it's sad to see and when i

335
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,680
would be in the recruiting college circuit the aau circuit and yeah i know scholarships are on

336
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,900
the line heck now money's on the line with name image and likeness so it's

337
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,740
really it's really an issue but you know that story with my son i would have parents concerned

338
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,240
parents my son's not playing enough my son's role and when i would meet with them i would use that

339
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,559
story sometimes to kind of show how my son shut me down just to kind of send a message indirectly

340
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,440
to my players parents like you know even i had a big mouth and my son told me to shut up because

341
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,599
in a lot of ways the young person especially the cop they they

342
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,359
they're very uncomfortable when their parents get involved you know and that was a dynamic

343
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,559
you know you had to manage i know i many times i'd have a player we're talking and he said

344
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,700
what coach my dad didn't call you did he said no no no now i i would never tell him the truth

345
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,539
you know unless it got really crazy but my dad my dad didn't call you right no no this is me and you

346
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:45,319
man to man he's 20 year old college i gotta you know deal with you and and that's really kind of

347
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,960
Notre Dame i'll talk to the parents about academics if we have some issues health whatever

348
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,779
but we are not going to talk basketball with parents my assistants i told my assistants you

349
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,859
diffuse the parents and every now and then just give them a call check in every two weeks now

350
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,460
you're going to get you're going to get some lightning probably because i've been an assistant

351
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,720
in college and got lightning from a parent after a game and nobody hit me harder than Bobby Hurley's

352
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,859
father a couple times and he was starting

353
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:24,380
every game from his freshman year on. But as the head coach, you've got to have that layer

354
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,400
of protection and really make it about the young person and it's me and you. We're going to have

355
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,019
to work this out. I'm going to ask you about the deep involvement you've had, coaches versus cancer,

356
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,559
and you've put an enormous amount of your own energy and resources and time into something

357
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,259
that's clearly inspired you to take action. Tell us about your passion for that.

358
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:51,380
Well, you know, my dad had a malignant melanoma in the late and mid-90s when I was at the

359
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,980
University of Delaware and this coaches versus cancer program, which is sponsored by the National

360
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:03,140
Association of Basketball Coaches here in the United States. That is the chosen charity. It

361
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,440
got started back in the mid-90s and so I jumped in on it at Delaware. We raised some really good

362
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,640
money. The neat thing about the charity, 95% of the funds stay in your community.

363
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,880
And so then when we went to Notre Dame, it really exploded. And the cool thing is,

364
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,339
I think we raised enough money at Notre Dame and the coach that replaced me, Micah Shrewsbury,

365
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:32,099
has continued the charity, which is awesome, but it's sponsored five or six grants at the

366
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:39,180
Harper Cancer Center on the Notre Dame campus, which was really cool. And as we know, cancer

367
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,839
actually got a shot at kind of beating it up a little bit the last, what, 10, 15 years,

368
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:50,859
per se. We may be able to win this thing, so let's keep doing it. But what it did also,

369
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:58,380
it was certainly a great charity and a great thing, but it got me involved in the community

370
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,779
and seen in my community in a different way, not just the basketball coach at Delaware at Notre

371
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:09,539
Dame. And I think that's really important in your community. These are your season ticket holders.

372
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:15,019
These are your supporters. These are the people that when you have a tough season are either going

373
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:15,240
to go, oh, I'm going to go to Notre Dame. I'm going to go to Notre Dame. I'm going to go to Notre

374
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:22,839
Dame. So we got them or we don't got them. And when they see you and you in a different light,

375
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:30,539
other than just the coach, the more human side and get to know you, I think it's very powerful

376
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:37,500
from that standpoint as well, not just the great deed of trying to kick cancer's ass.

377
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,980
It sort of leads me to another, your whole world has been, you understand the coaching landscape,

378
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,700
you're now in the...

379
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:50,640
Incredibly competitive world of professional basketball, one of the most elite sports in the

380
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,859
world. And the pressure that comes on senior, from those stakeholders, that it's unrealistic.

381
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,019
You either win a championship or you fail, it seems, and you can go into the English Premier

382
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:07,240
League or sports all around the world. And you've got these hyper media, you lose three games and

383
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,579
you want to sack one of the great coaches of all time. What's your advice to coaches listening on

384
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:15,240
that amount of stakeholder pressure that comes their way?

385
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:21,619
This is what I'd say to guys. And I see young guys on the road or we meet for a game and are

386
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:27,759
struggling and they go into this and that. I said, hey, this still beats a real job. Remember,

387
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,019
this still beats a real job. They're like, yeah, yeah, coach, you're right. You're right. You're

388
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:38,059
right. Now I had to remind myself many times, you lose four or five in a row and a South Bend,

389
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:43,740
Indiana winner, it gets a little dark, you know, and you could go to some dark places.

390
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:51,420
But, you know, we're, everybody's been well compensated in the coaching profession.

391
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,140
And I use the phrase too, we all know what we signed up for. Like we know what we signed up

392
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,759
for. Now this is high risk, high reward business. The highs are amazingly high. The lows can be

393
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:10,259
amazingly low. Can you find a little bit of a midpoint and a balance point and keep it in

394
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,980
perspective? And I think I got better at that as I got a little more experienced.

395
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,039
Yeah. As a coach.

396
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,279
It's a great answer as it always felt. Your worst day as a professional athlete is

397
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,619
probably someone's best day. Even when you're injured, you're in the gym, you're surrounded by

398
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:31,180
community and great perspective is not always an easy thing to see, but when you can, it changes

399
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:42,349
your life. We all are born different. As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks,

400
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,630
uniquely our own.

401
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:58,599
No one sees an idea, opinion, or opportunity like you. And no one sees you like VU. Victoria

402
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,299
University. Uniquely you.

403
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,640
Hi, my name's Mim. I do a Bachelor of Social Work. I got this tattoo done for my 20th birthday

404
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,880
present because I was born as a twin, but she passed away because my mum had ovarian cancer

405
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,859
during pregnancy. So my name's Mirian Deer.

406
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,279
My name is Mirian Deer, which means rainbow. And it means the bridge between, for our ancestors

407
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,200
to reach their afterlife, which is what my sister was called, which is the Wadatutti,

408
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,799
which is the Milky Way. And that's where they go as the stars and they live there.

409
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,880
VU is very supportive. It doesn't matter if you're an Indigenous student,

410
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,059
wouldn't they bother to make sure that you're very well taken care of?

411
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,339
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect, is something we're really passionate and proud of.

412
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,380
We bring together groups of five to six people.

413
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,200
Around the globe from diverse backgrounds, sport, industry, social venture, and the arts,

414
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,019
we come together to learn, to connect, and to collaborate.

415
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,680
Vanessa Ford, Chief Operating Officer at Kukua.

416
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:04,859
The Alita Connect experience for me has been transformational. I met people that I would

417
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:10,819
never have met from totally different spheres. It's very basic. It's all about relationships.

418
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:16,119
It's all about how we communicate. And what the Alita Connect group does that is so powerful

419
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,240
is when you bring two people together, you're able to connect. And that's what Alita Connect does.

420
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,259
It's all about how we communicate. And what the Alita Connect group does that is so powerful,

421
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:17,859
is when you bring two people together, you're able to connect. And that's what Alita Connect does.

422
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,680
From two totally different worlds together, there's no ego. It just leaves room for the real you.

423
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,700
And I think that's what Alita gave me, was bringing back the real me and really connecting

424
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,779
to my own leadership style. I've got to delve into a young

425
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:42,079
athlete under your care at the moment at the Hawks, a young Australian by the name of Dyson

426
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,200
Daniels, who's having a great season and making a big impact. Tell us a bit about him.

427
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,859
You mean the great?

428
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,559
The great barrier thief, as he has been dubbed here in the United States. And I know you have

429
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:59,920
a connection to the family. And he has been, first of all, if he doesn't get defensive player

430
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:09,420
of the year, I'm going to go on a major protest to the NBA offices in New York. But he has been,

431
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:17,339
for a young player, a young prospect, he's kind of found himself here. I think Quinn Snyder's done a

432
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:17,859
fabulous job. He's done a fabulous job. He's done a fabulous job. He's done a fabulous job.

433
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,380
He's done a fabulous job with his psyche and getting him more confident. And what he's doing

434
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,359
defensively, I'll say this, Luke, and you probably saw it over there as a young player. I have been

435
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:36,599
around this game 45 years. I've never seen a player with the defensive instincts to get a hand

436
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:45,079
on a ball, anticipate a steal. You can't teach it. There's no way. And he'll come up with, he comes

437
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,819
up with, he's averaging three a game, which leads to, he's averaging three a game, which leads to,

438
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,559
but he'll come and the assistant that sits next to him, we just look at each other and go,

439
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,299
are you kidding me? Like, that's unbelievable. And he's done it at crunch time many times. Now

440
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:04,980
he's become a more aggressive and comfortable offensive player. He's scoring, he's shooting

441
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,539
that floater that I think has front spin on it. That must be an Australian rules football kind of

442
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:17,299
fundamental. And, you know, so when I dap him up, you know, when you, when he loves golf, as you

443
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:17,799
know, he loves golf. He loves golf. He loves golf. He loves golf. He loves golf. He loves golf. He loves

444
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:23,519
to play golf. So we always dap up with the golf grip before the game, you know, I always hit him

445
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,500
with the golf grip, but now that's my way of kind of trying to loosen them up. Even though the man

446
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:38,480
is so steady, he shows no, he just is right there physically durable. I have been so impressed. And

447
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:46,119
he, you know, you think about the future of the Hawks with a rock solid player person, he's going

448
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,539
to eventually become a voice.

449
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:55,420
And I, I just, you gotta be awfully proud. I mean, watching him, it, it's a, it's an amazing

450
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:01,539
story. And here's, I saw when I was an assistant coach at Duke university, I saw his dad play in

451
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:07,099
high school. That's how far we go back. What a great, great story. And, um, sorry,

452
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,799
as a 12 year old, he was a beautiful athlete then. And it's a, it's great to say, what a,

453
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,400
what a way to endear yourself to your teammates by being one of the great defensive players and

454
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,220
doing the team things.

455
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,240
I love asking these sets of questions to people with your wisdom and, and history and these

456
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,299
patterns of leadership that we're a bit obsessed about in, in the world of a leader. We start with

457
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:34,019
this idea of, uh, you know, self-leadership. Is there one thing that's always worked for you as

458
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:41,900
a leader that you would never change? Being, um, always accessible for your players. Um,

459
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,220
my door was always open in the office. And I told my administrative assistant,

460
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm on the phone or I'm in something. And a player happens to walk into the offices,

461
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:57,420
stop me and have a channel him through channel him through it. And maybe 30 seconds. Hey, what's

462
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,500
that? How was class test? Whatever. Oh, by the way, today, defensively, just get a little plug

463
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,000
in pick and roll defense. We're going to got, you know, just how's mom. How's your brother doing?

464
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:13,159
He played last night, something touching them when they come through and, and having that

465
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,199
personal touch. And then, and then, you know, can you be, can you be, can you be, can you be

466
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:25,460
humble and they feel it's about them. And, you know, I never wanted to be on the media guide.

467
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,940
It, you know, they used to do, they don't do it anymore. They're all online, but they used to

468
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,380
print these big old media guides and there's, well, coach this year, we want you with the

469
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,019
captain's. I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to be on that. No, no, no. Have them on there.

470
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:44,119
You know, can you, can you have it even at press conferences when it'd be the coach and two players,

471
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,199
they would ask me a question. And I, a lot of times,

472
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:53,679
would turn to Pat, what, what do you think? And have them be the spokesman. So they feel like,

473
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,320
man, he's, he wants us to be on selfish. He's amazingly coaches on selfish, man. You know,

474
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:05,860
we would fly in the NCAA tournament. We would charter bigger planes. There was a first class

475
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,579
section players always sat up there. I'm in the back man. There's I'm always a no, no coach.

476
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,619
There's an extra one. Nope, nope, nope. You got it. Put the senior manager up there.

477
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:22,800
Um, you go in to eat, eat last one. There there's a great book entitled leaders eat last

478
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,719
stand in the back. We'll get there. Let everybody, you know, just, just so they kind of feel, you

479
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:35,219
know, it's, it's, it's them. It's not about you and that they know you really got their back when

480
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:41,880
they've been punched, you know, and that you can say in front of them and to the media cut fellas.

481
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,519
I, I, I screwed up. I should have helped you more tonight.

482
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:52,519
We, now we got to do these three things better, but I, I I've screwed up with that and we're going

483
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,280
to address that tomorrow. And, you know, and, and, and not I coach good. They play bad. I mean,

484
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,179
when you get into that buddy, you're going to lose them. You know, I love the, the, the pattern

485
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:09,039
of that, Morgan, you described in such a brilliant way, but leaders that take accountability together

486
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,960
or put their hand up if it didn't go right. And also that, that common thing around that genuine,

487
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,320
authentic care for people.

488
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,960
In whatever discipline, it seems something you've been brilliant at for, for 45 years.

489
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,480
How do you fill your own cup up, Mike, to make sure that you can lead others the way you want to?

490
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:33,139
You know, who was it? Tony Blair was on a thing that CNN did about five years ago. It was a

491
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:39,340
leadership thing. And he said, most leaders don't take or make the time for creative thought

492
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:45,559
because when you're running the thing, it's coming at you so fast and you can get caught up,

493
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:50,039
you know, in the little things and the minutiae and things that hopefully you can learn to

494
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:58,800
delegate. But where do you get away to kind of think creatively? Mine has been swimming. My mom,

495
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,039
you know, she tried to make a swimmer out of me. Great story, Luke. She caught me sneaking out of

496
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,260
swimming practice when I was 10 years old and I begged her to go to basketball camp and the rest

497
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,639
is history. And she, I was sneaking. I was like, mom, I'm not, now my sister swam and she was an

498
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:25,280
LSU, but there was no way I was doing that like her. Now I do it. And when I, when I, what I loved

499
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
it, cause I would swim in the morning when I was at Notre Dame and I could, you know, what's great

500
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,639
when your head's underwater, no one can talk to you. Nobody can talk to you. Nobody can interrupt

501
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,260
you. And I would swim for 30 minutes and I would think about my day practice plan this, who do I

502
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,599
touch? And so that was kind of not only get your cardio, your physical stuff, but also get your

503
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:52,239
mental stuff. But it was my mental stuff too. And, and in a, you know, so that, that, that was a

504
00:37:52,239 --> 00:38:00,559
nice routine when I was a head coach, you know, I, I would always go to breakfast by myself. I had a

505
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,539
spot I would go. I didn't want to, you know, I would sit in a corner. They kind of would hide

506
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:08,940
me out in this one restaurant in South Bend. I got a few here in Atlanta and you could kind of

507
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,440
think a little bit and get your day organized. Mark, can you tell a story of a visionary later

508
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:22,119
inspired you to follow their vision? You know, I was so lucky with Morgan Wooten and then I did

509
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,760
eight years with Mike Krzyzewski and, and that was, you know, such a masterclass in leadership

510
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:35,559
and preparation. And one of the phrases that I think I picked up many, but, but the one theme was

511
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:42,940
as a college coach, you're running your program, just, we got to compete every day and you may be

512
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,440
competing more in May and August in recruiting.

513
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:51,340
Or what you're doing then, then during the season, just wake up ready to compete every day.

514
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:59,260
And, you know, that, that was a theme and, uh, uh, that, that Mike K I think really instilled in it.

515
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,719
He, he lived it. And, and I think as young assistants, and there were many of us that

516
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,760
came through and went on Quinn Snyder being one of them, um, as well. And, and you kind of learned

517
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,480
how to really think about in the morning, you know, what are we doing?

518
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:20,559
Today to get better. And it made it's May. It's not a practice day. What, what are we doing today?

519
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,440
Are we doing it in recruiting? Are we doing it in marketing? Are we doing it? And as we sit down

520
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,579
and talk about our attack against his own defense, you know, and, and that was, um, that was a great

521
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,960
vibe for me to be around as an assistant for eight years.

522
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,239
Mike, you mentioned Tony Blair and, uh, carving out time for creativity. And we, we see

523
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,559
inherently curious people have success like yours.

524
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:49,340
How do you find time to fill that curiosity cup up for yourself?

525
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:55,199
Yeah. And I'll tell you the last two years, what's been great is the NBA has been such a new world.

526
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:03,019
I was a college coach for 35 years and then to go to the NBA and I watched the NBA, but I never

527
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:08,860
really dug into it. I would watch the playoffs after our season, but now you have different

528
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:15,119
coaches, different styles of play, philosophically, 24 second shot clock. The rules are different. The

529
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:21,699
game is 48 minutes, not 40, like in college. And there's it. So it was almost in a way like a

530
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:26,900
different sport and it was energizing on a daily basis. Okay. We got Charlotte tonight.

531
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:33,000
What do they do? What's this coach known for? I knew that in the ACC, I knew that you got to know

532
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,599
the guys and how they played and that what their style of play was. So that has been like amazingly

533
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:45,360
refreshing to learn. The neat aspect of being in the NBA is the players,

534
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:52,960
most, I saw most of these guys. You talked about seeing Dyson when he was 12. I saw these guys when

535
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,639
they were 13 and 14 playing on the AAU circuit. I recruited many of them. I have like a reference

536
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,039
point with them and I'll say, Hey, I remember when you played into Peach Jam, which is a big

537
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,980
Nike tournament in Georgia. I remember seeing you in a coach. You saw us down there. I said,

538
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,960
Oh yeah. I saw you guys play against that team from New Jersey. You were rolling that night.

539
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,460
You saw that, didn't you coach?

540
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,539
Yeah.

541
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:15,599
Yeah.

542
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:21,380
Remember that? You remember that? And, you know, so it's been really, for me, I've been able to

543
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,539
connect with these, these guys. And then when we play, you know, our opponents, you know,

544
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,079
the guys will come up after the game, Jalen Brunson, the Knicks beat us at like the buzzer

545
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,500
and I'm walking off and Jalen Brunson comes over. He was a Chicago kid who we didn't get.

546
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,679
We tried to get, he went to Villanova. He comes up, coach, how you doing, man? I said,

547
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,119
Jalen, I'm so proud of you. And, you know, so that's been really kind of cool.

548
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,380
To see them as men now and, and what they've become when I saw them when they were 14 or 15 years old.

549
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,940
Mike, we've got this small obsession with the idea of collaboration when you put great people

550
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:05,159
together and the sum of that knowledge becomes often a fascinating thing to watch. Have you

551
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,380
got an example of a great collaboration in your life?

552
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:16,010
You know, and maybe, maybe more so, and I can't think of a specific one off the top of my head,

553
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,510
but just the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know,

554
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:23,969
the theme of, you know, it's been interesting for me because I was a head coach for 30 years

555
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:31,710
and now I'm assistant again. And, you know, learning that role of being supportive of the

556
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:39,269
leader. I tell, I tell people I'm a listener. I'm a great listener to the, I've got a young staff

557
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:43,949
and I just want to listen a lot of times. And maybe I'll come back the next day

558
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:46,489
with the young assistant who said, you know, and I think, you know, I'm a great listener.

559
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:53,110
And even with the head coach, Quinn, who I coached at Duke, he, when I was an assistant at Duke in

560
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:58,969
late eighties, he was the point guard. I was the mediator between Mike Krzyzewski and 20 year old

561
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:04,469
Quinn Snyder. I was 27 at the time. And it's funny how our relationship now, 40 years later,

562
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:11,349
sometimes I'm mediating between him and a player just like I did back in the day. So it's been,

563
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,090
it's kind of been full circle. But knowing,

564
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:22,710
you know, I think, especially as an assistant being secure and doing it for the group and not

565
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:29,550
worried about whose idea it was or who gets the credit. And, and, and I think that's something

566
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:37,050
that, that, you know, kind of, I had to go step back into that role, but luckily I did it before

567
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,989
for eight years as an assistant at Duke for five years as an assistant with Morgan Wooten at De

568
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:46,030
Mathis. So it was, it was kind of comfortable to get back in it.

569
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:51,070
Mike, do you have a mantra when it comes to communication in your leadership roles?

570
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:59,090
Mentor wise, you know, it's sad. Coach Wooten passed, you know, a while ago and he was such a

571
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,650
great guy to bounce things off of. I still communicate with Mike Krzyzewski and it's

572
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:10,989
interesting because Mike had Quinn and I both, you know, so there's a little bit of a, of a

573
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:16,469
connection there as far as communication and thinking it through.

574
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:22,429
And, and then, you know, there's some guys that I coached against in college that I still stay

575
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:28,429
in, in, you know, in touch with, you know, Tom Izzo at Michigan State and we banged, you know,

576
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:35,070
you, you share stuff when the off season, you bounce things off of, of people and they'll call

577
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:39,230
and go, Hey, what are you guys running? Or I'll watch something. And, and so you still have,

578
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:44,690
you still have that, the network. Most of my network are college guys. I'm still early in

579
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,469
the NBA thing, but a lot of those college guys are college guys. And so, and, and, and, and, and,

580
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:52,889
college guys are veteran dudes who've seen it all. And I mentioned Izzo, but a Bill Self and a

581
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:58,949
John Calipari and a Jay Wright who coached at Villanova is now retired. Those were kind of

582
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:05,510
my era of guys. And I think we still kind of share things at times and vent at times too.

583
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,949
Mike, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

584
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:15,949
Well, you know what I would have to say, I would have to say my parents and, and,

585
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:16,449
you know, I would have to say my parents. And, and, you know, I would have to say my parents.

586
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:24,590
You know, probably I look at my mom who somehow got into women's swimming in the 1950s when there

587
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:30,710
was no opportunity for women's sports. My grandfather to have the wherewithal,

588
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:38,110
he sent her to New York from the coal country of Pennsylvania. And she swam at the YMCA in

589
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,630
Manhattan and took the train all the way back. And, you know, to, she was an unbelievable inspiration.

590
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:52,230
And it was always a tough act to follow because whatever I achieved, she was an Olympian. And I

591
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:59,030
dang sure never got close to that. And, you know, so, you know, that, that's a tough act to follow

592
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,769
when your mom was an Olympian and an all American. And then she was the great dynamic, which was

593
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:13,389
really neat loop. When I was at GW finishing, she was the women's swimming coach. And so I'd go by

594
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,590
her office and, you know, then she,

595
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,849
come watch us play and watch practice. And so I got, got my undergrad degree in 82 and she got

596
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:26,969
her master's at say, I couldn't even, I couldn't even have graduation day. I had to share that

597
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:32,469
with her. She got her master's. I mean, it's unbelievable, but, but an amazingly intense

598
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:39,170
competitive. I mean, you don't get where she got, she, you know, and I, and just seeing her edge

599
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:45,590
and her game day and she swam masters. So she was like 70 and was pissed off at her time,

600
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:53,010
and she knew who she had to beat. I'm like, mom, just calm down. But, you know, she created a

601
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:59,289
monster. I'm, I, I think, I think, you know, I blame her. I blame her for some of my issues.

602
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,989
It's a great story. I love the, I'm sitting in Melbourne, Australia now, and I know the 1956

603
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:10,750
Olympic pool very well. It's the old glass house. That's now a home base for the biggest sporting

604
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,469
club in Australia and the Melbourne cricket ground where she would have walked around as an athlete

605
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:15,469
in 1956.

606
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:21,230
We, we think is a bit of the Mecca for sport here in Australia and to think your mom and to

607
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:26,150
understand what it would have been like, as you said, for a young woman in the 1950s to pursue

608
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:33,130
a sport. I don't think people in 2025 could really understand how big a hurdle she had to overcome.

609
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:36,369
It's a, it's a remarkable story. I love hearing all about it.

610
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:43,010
My latest mission is, so she was a butterflyer and she swam butterfly in the fifties when it

611
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,610
became the fourth stroke. There were only three strokes for a woman.

612
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:52,449
So her and an East German woman were breaking each other's world records, you know, cause it was a new,

613
00:47:52,530 --> 00:48:01,349
but she didn't qualify to swim it in Melbourne. So she swam the freestyle relay. And so she swam

614
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:08,969
all the preliminary events, but not the final. They won the silver in 1970. They said, moving

615
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:14,269
forward, anyone who swims the preliminary events gets a medal, even if they don't swim the final.

616
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,550
Well, my mom is on a,

617
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:21,670
on a list of about 170 athletes from all kinds of countries who didn't get their medal. And to her

618
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:27,590
dying day, she was pissed off that she didn't get that medal. And I have been working USA swimming

619
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,610
and my sister and I like, if we can someday get that medal.

620
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,969
Well, let's put that out into the ether. Now, if anyone deserves that for a life of,

621
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:41,909
of contribution. And I love that you and your sister are still fighting hard for that.

622
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:45,590
Final question, Mike, and it's been a great pleasure to spend some time with you,

623
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,610
but we are, uh, as I said, a bit obsessed in our leader world about collaboration and,

624
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:56,070
and to hear your wisdom today is something to celebrate as well. Has there been anyone in

625
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,289
the world? You've got to connect with incredible people right across your working life. God love

626
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:04,909
to have collaborated with that coach or someone else in another passion of your life. Is there

627
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:09,050
a name that springs to mind? Yeah. You know, I, I, we were talking,

628
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:15,369
I was watching some NFL stuff earlier today and I don't know him well, but you know,

629
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:21,909
John Harbaugh would be a guy I'd love to spend some time with. Uh, his daughter actually played

630
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:28,789
lacrosse at Notre Dame and I just missed on some of the weekends when he would come into town,

631
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:34,329
but to like have a beer with him or any kind of, you know, and, and, you know, I, I just love his

632
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:39,869
style and he's been there and he's been doing it and he never panics and he's just always poised.

633
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,789
He's one of those guys. I love watching the Ravens play. Certainly they're a good team, but

634
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:48,610
they're a good team. And then I watch his press conferences and his message and I'm like, you

635
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,269
know what? That, that, that I'd like to hang out with him.

636
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,989
That would be a fun night at the bar having a beer and I'm sure there'd be some great, uh,

637
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:02,989
wisdom shared. Uh, Mike, I know the schedule of your life is, uh, is, is full on as an NBA

638
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:08,110
coach. So I really appreciate you giving us some time and, uh, sharing your life history. I've

639
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,210
loved every minute of it. Really appreciate you joining me.

640
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,329
Well, Luke, it was an honor to be with you. And I will tell Dyson Daniels, uh, tomorrow,

641
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,269
at our shoot around, we got the Clippers tomorrow night. We've won four in a row,

642
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:24,710
but I'm going to tell him, uh, I hung out with you and I do give him when he makes a three,

643
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:30,409
I do give him the Australian rules football official thing sometimes. And he goes, where

644
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:34,730
did you see that coach? I said, I sold out a couple of years ago. Those guys are dressed so

645
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:40,789
good and they give the goal. I love it. It was he and my, my son who plays sport for a living

646
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:45,070
here in Australia. We're, we're in a, in a junior state team together. And, uh,

647
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:49,170
my son's an obsessed, obsessed golfer and they've remained friends. So he'll know,

648
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,230
uh, Sam, we're on the sidelines. It's a, it's a great thing to watch young people

649
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:57,170
fill their dream, isn't it? So, um, he's in good hands having you on the sidelines.

650
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:00,369
So thanks again, Mike. Great to see you. Great to be with you, Luke. Take care.
