00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,199
I hope you enjoyed this chat with Mike Dunlap,

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,679
one of the most respected coaches in the world,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,300
revered for his ability to get the most out of people.

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,339
I found myself writing notes all the way through it

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:19,260
from the brilliance of the Miracle Morning

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,660
and his passion for daily routines,

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,980
his clarity on what makes Michael Jordan the greatest of all time,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,699
having been the senior coach of the team that Michael Jordan owns,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,240
to his respect and empathy for everyone in his environment.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
It's full of gold, full of wisdom,

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,119
and came across Mike through the work that we are doing

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,380
at Alita, a business founded with my great friend Matt Waterwitz

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,000
over seven years ago.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,960
Mike, part of our signature program, Alita Connect,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,420
where we connect great leaders around the world,

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,380
and Mike is one of the brilliant examples of it.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,719
He collaborates on a monthly basis with John Alawisi,

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,439
Craig McRae from the Magpies,

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,119
Andrew McDonald from Australian Cricket,

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,179
Anthony Seabold, who's got an incredible reputation

21
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,299
in the world of rugby,

22
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,260
and also on a global scale,

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,579
Mike's joined one of the Alita Connect programs we have

24
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,200
with Mikel Arteta from Arsenal,

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,500
Matt LeFleur, who you'll hear him talk about,

26
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,659
the coach of the Green Bay Packers in this conversation,

27
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,799
and the relationship that they're building.

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,659
George Carl is a mentor of his,

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,579
and Eddie Jones from English Rugby

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,060
has also been a guest on this podcast.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,219
We love the idea of leaders getting together to collaborate.

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,780
You don't have to be a global leader

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,319
to join one of our signature programs, Alita Connect.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,299
In fact, our passion is connecting people

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,980
from small business,

36
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,400
and the arts, and different areas.

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,739
And if you're interested in doing it,

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,879
Up next, a legend in the world of elite coaching,

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,560
Mike Dunlap.

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,060
Mike Dunlap is the current assistant coach

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,500
of the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA,

43
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,060
a team that he helped win

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,079
only their second ever NBA championship in 2021.

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,040
In 2012, Mike Dunlap joined

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
the Michael Jordan-owned Charlotte Bobcats as head coach,

47
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,479
becoming the only coach in NBA history

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,340
to triple a team's win

49
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
from the preseason.

50
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,000
The NBA Hall of Fame coach,

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,979
George Carl, has this to say about Mike.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Mike Dunlap absolutely elevates every player

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
and team that he comes into contact with.

54
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,280
He's our guy.

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,139
He will take you from good to great.

56
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,800
Name any top-level elite coach in the game.

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,379
The only difference between Mike and them

58
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,219
is their address.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
There is no higher level of coaching ability than his.

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,520
There is absolutely no one better.

61
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,520
Mike Dunlap, it's great to catch up with you today.

62
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,099
Thanks for your time.

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:41,180
I'll see you next time.

64
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,020
I suppose high praise from a Hall of Famer in George Carl.

65
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,080
He may have had some beers before he said that,

66
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,360
but that's okay too.

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,460
No, I mean, I've been fortunate enough

68
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,759
to have mentors in the business

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,719
that were great teachers.

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,979
And as you know, being a player,

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,180
a former player,

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,620
that the ability to teach is everything.

73
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,199
And then the other part of that is to connect,

74
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,180
you know, the words you use to care,

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,659
for more than the performance

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,960
and get that across to your players is everything.

77
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,139
You talk about that care and connect.

78
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,060
You've had success everywhere you've gone, Mike.

79
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,759
And we always hear the term, you know,

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,580
success leaves clues.

81
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,560
And I'm not surprised you started there.

82
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,319
You know, for us, it feels like coaches

83
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,520
are now very much about the whole athlete.

84
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,840
What's been your success to being a consistently great coach?

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,960
I would say you're only as good as the talent that you have.

86
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
And in the journey,

87
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,800
many of the places that I haven't had success,

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,180
all I have to do is run to the nearest mirror.

89
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,300
And I think that if you're asking accountability

90
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,819
of your team and players,

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,439
my point is, is that the sport will drive you

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,319
if you're open to it, to humility.

93
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Example given, best on ground,

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,379
he could be that week and get the medal.

95
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,740
And then the next week he could,

96
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,180
uh,

97
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,120
tear his anterior cruciate.

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,379
So I just think that the, the trail of success is,

99
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,019
is, uh, laden with touchstones of humility,

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,160
sincerity, and being open to the fact that players make coaches,

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,579
coaches don't make players.

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,220
Yeah.

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,839
I love the, uh, the fact that you go to humility,

104
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,439
Mike, over the, over the time.

105
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,339
And, uh, yeah, that is incredible humility because we also know,

106
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,600
you know, that, uh, that elite coaches have consistency in,

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,839
in, in success, but you, you bring it back to, you know,

108
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,439
that you're going to get humility in professional sport,

109
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,740
whether you like it or not.

110
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,180
And, and accepting that,

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,899
is that sort of part of the process as well?

112
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,000
I think so.

113
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,899
The thing that blocks learning is ego and what feeds ego is a paradox.

114
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,139
You have success and then the blinders start to come up.

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,860
And I think it's really important that, you know,

116
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,879
daily that routine getting up early,

117
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,319
working,

118
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,319
hard regardless of the success you've had and then attributing,

119
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,600
uh, that success to others and understanding that it's true.

120
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,199
Uh, and really believing that I think what gets in the way is,

121
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,860
you know,

122
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,019
all the back slapping and the high praise,

123
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,360
um, is something that you have to move through.

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,579
I don't think you have to fear it,

125
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,199
but I think you have to have a system to process it and move it away from

126
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,560
yourself because hunger is a,

127
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,120
really interesting conundrum.

128
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:49,000
And so in order to continue to have that appetite as you go on,

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,319
you've got a vault,

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,420
the success that you've had,

131
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,560
um,

132
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:54,699
and,

133
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:00,259
and go on and just stay thirsty for the cutting edge because the game

134
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,620
changes a generationally,

135
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,939
the parenting is different.

136
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,980
So the players that you're getting still want a clarity,

137
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,480
competition,

138
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,139
uh,

139
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,399
but they want it straight.

140
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,100
And so again,

141
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,939
I think that you have to be very,

142
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,639
very careful with success.

143
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,420
And you might find some of these questions,

144
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:21,779
uh,

145
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,060
John,

146
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,019
I think you're going to deflect a lot of them through humility,

147
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,560
but I love this set about you.

148
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,860
One of your former players had this to say,

149
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,420
coach Dunlop came and built upon what my father had already done in my life.

150
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,699
He ushered a lot of us into adulthood with his values of hard work and

151
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,980
commitment and honesty,

152
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,379
the things he has proceeded to,

153
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,180
and still does the abilities and these principles he lives by still today.

154
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,720
It feels like a beautiful thing for a former player to say about you.

155
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,680
Can you expand a bit,

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:49,939
Mike,

157
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,100
on,

158
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,060
on those values that those that come under your leadership talk about?

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,620
Well,

160
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,560
regardless of,

161
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,480
of your values,

162
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,540
I think that the seven habits of highly successful people book written by Covey,

163
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:04,500
um,

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,339
he,

165
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,139
he talks about values are one thing and everybody has,

166
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,879
maybe different values,

167
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,740
but you just have to have them.

168
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,899
And I thought that the end part of that statement was quite powerful is that,

169
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,339
um,

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,620
they transition you,

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,639
whether that's work hard,

172
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,680
uh,

173
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,879
give credit where credit is due,

174
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,220
uh,

175
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,360
move with great sincerity,

176
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,379
uh,

177
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:39,579
and understand that life is to be an enjoyed all of those transitional points as a coach or teacher,

178
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,899
lead you to trust.

179
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,240
Because if you're not competent,

180
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,459
the surgeon can be a derelict,

181
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,220
he can be an alcoholic 22 hours a day.

182
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,439
But the fact of the matter is when he's sober for those two hours and the best surgeon in the world,

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,079
people really don't care about the periphery.

184
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,800
You know,

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,220
they're not going to delve in mightily to your values.

186
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,540
They just want to know that you know your job and can do your job.

187
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,439
Yes,

188
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,839
it's more expansive than that.

189
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,540
But the most important thing,

190
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,660
the most important thing to get across to your players and to your staff is that you know your trade,

191
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,680
you know your craft,

192
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,279
you know how players learn because you know the five laws of learning and can you spit those out?

193
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,199
Can you give examples of what they mean?

194
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,839
And can you speak in metaphors and similes to paint a picture because that's what players want.

195
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,759
And a bottom line is that what drives most players is competition.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,139
They want to know who won,

197
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:37,980
who lost.

198
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,059
There's a book out,

199
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,960
a long time ago written by a guy named Novak called the joy of sport.

200
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,740
And he said that all these seven year olds got in a sandbox.

201
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,700
He was observing,

202
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,159
he was doing his dissertation and he said,

203
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,120
before you knew it,

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,559
the kids designed their own game and rules.

205
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,600
In other words,

206
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,100
people like rules.

207
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
They want to know who won and who lost.

208
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:08,159
And so a coach's job is to connect and intrinsically get people tap into that competitive warrior like person and say,

209
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,600
okay,

210
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
here we go.

211
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,480
Here's a way of getting about it.

212
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,919
And here's how you get the scalp,

213
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,820
so to speak.

214
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,600
And from my standpoint,

215
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,480
you have,

216
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,340
once you get that in a player,

217
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,639
then you can bring them back to why manners are important.

218
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,120
Why opening a door for a young lady is,

219
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,500
is timeless.

220
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:35,120
Why kindness is something that will make you more than just a competitor and a player,

221
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,159
because those things last a lifetime.

222
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,419
They stay in the soul.

223
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,679
If you will,

224
00:09:40,039 --> 00:10:02,480
when you're taking your prowess at 30 or 28 or 32 and all that winning and you go to a halfway house or you go to people who have less than you do and you give away your gifts to them to give them something special on the day because that may be their best day,

225
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,659
given the fact that they're on an oxygen machine.

226
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,019
Yeah,

227
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:06,919
a bit preachy,

228
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,580
but the fact of the matter is,

229
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,799
is that I don't care where you go.

230
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,600
You'll find that very successful people typically are very kind hearted.

231
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,500
And really,

232
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,600
when you want to be altruistic,

233
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,200
you want to give all those gifts away.

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840
So much gold there,

235
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,139
Mike,

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,399
in,

237
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,820
in your words.

238
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,240
And I'm,

239
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,279
I'm picking up and writing notes as,

240
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:28,200
as you're talking.

241
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,519
And,

242
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:28,919
you know,

243
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,080
the Stephen Covey book,

244
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,159
seven habits of highly effective people worth a read.

245
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,360
If you,

246
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
if you haven't and,

247
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,820
and,

248
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,500
and the joy of sport as well as it is a,

249
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,120
is a great,

250
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,840
and I love that you,

251
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,379
you know,

252
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:43,320
don't separate kind hardness and,

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
and being a good person from high performance.

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
And you make that link that,

255
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,980
that,

256
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,679
that that's there.

257
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:48,860
And I,

258
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,980
and also going back to what you said before about you touched on having good

259
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,620
habits and people with good routines.

260
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,240
Can you talk about some of those habits?

261
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,639
Cause I think that it clearly applies to your world of professional sport,

262
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,080
but also success in life.

263
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,500
Why are those habits so important?

264
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,220
Well,

265
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,539
again,

266
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,960
credit given to,

267
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,899
um,

268
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:06,500
a,

269
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,179
uh,

270
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
having great English teachers,

271
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,100
teachers from grade school on up.

272
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,740
And so at some point in time,

273
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,840
I made a decision to be an English major.

274
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,940
Um,

275
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,019
there was a book out small book called the miracle morning.

276
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,879
And there's an aphorism,

277
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,759
uh,

278
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,879
and an acronym,

279
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,019
if you will,

280
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,000
uh,

281
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,220
called savers.

282
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,139
And in the morning,

283
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,879
if you get up early,

284
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,860
you have solitude.

285
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,059
And as you know,

286
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,480
Mr.

287
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,419
Rogers said is back in the day is we have a noisy,

288
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:38,980
see world.

289
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,600
And as the medium of,

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,039
of,

291
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,399
of texting and,

292
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,039
and,

293
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:48,480
and the computer and all these things came into play for this generation.

294
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
The point is,

295
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,080
is that all this noise is taking you away from reflection and thinking the

296
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,960
value of thinking is one of those habits.

297
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,379
Okay.

298
00:11:59,379 --> 00:11:59,659
Well,

299
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,559
how do I move myself into a habit of sitting early in the morning before

300
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,879
anybody gets up and using the anachronism and,

301
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,399
and savers is simple.

302
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,600
It's S is for silence means that you're going to meditate.

303
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,360
A is for affirmations.

304
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,120
And that could be,

305
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,759
uh,

306
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,159
you know,

307
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,720
talk positive,

308
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,000
think positive and act positive and drill that into your head.

309
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,799
V is for visualization,

310
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,980
create your own picture on the act of kindness or opening a door or doing

311
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,419
things,

312
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,220
but you have to have your own picture in order to enact that.

313
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,860
And then you go to E,

314
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
exercise.

315
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,240
Okay.

316
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
I only have 10 minutes,

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,440
pop down and do some pushups in the,

318
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,259
say 60 minutes where you're away from everybody.

319
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,399
If that's the minimum that you've,

320
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,399
that's all you've got to dedicate to it.

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
Take a bite of the apple and go on.

322
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:52,139
All right.

323
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,120
Then from there,

324
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,980
you go to,

325
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,980
you know,

326
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:55,440
uh,

327
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,700
S A V E R read.

328
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,539
All right.

329
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,440
So you want to read every day.

330
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,740
That could be the New Yorker that could be,

331
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:03,340
uh,

332
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,080
over here,

333
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,340
the Atlantic.

334
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,700
Okay.

335
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,259
That's kind of esoteric.

336
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,799
All right.

337
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,580
Read sports,

338
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,299
illustrated,

339
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,860
read off of,

340
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,820
you know,

341
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,440
something that you get that leads you to an article on Twitter,

342
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,320
you know,

343
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,200
go to Instagram and somebody suggests something.

344
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,960
It can be in a myriad of different forms.

345
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,019
And then finally,

346
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,679
the last S is journaling or scribing.

347
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,960
So what I've done is I've taken it through an acronym and then each day,

348
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,919
I'll show you my notebook.

349
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,539
I wrote down what you had said to me,

350
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,440
and I'm only looking,

351
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,259
looking for the eyes of the fish.

352
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,879
You said success leaves clues.

353
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,620
Okay.

354
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:43,799
So I'm,

355
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm stealing from you.

356
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:45,799
You know,

357
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,440
I'll give what I've got,

358
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,399
but the humility and the connection of validation of another human being,

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,779
all you have to do is write something down that they talk about.

360
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,759
When a child has been abused,

361
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,340
you never go directly at the child.

362
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,059
When somebody has a hard time or they've lost a tough game,

363
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,279
you go to a,

364
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,320
a common object as opposed,

365
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,059
it could be a truck in the sandbox.

366
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,039
It could be a teddy bear or whatever,

367
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,100
but you use another medium to get to what you want eventually.

368
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,899
And that's a methodology.

369
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,080
And so I bring myself back to some habits there.

370
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,399
Personally,

371
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,139
I like to meditate.

372
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:27,980
Second,

373
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,600
I like to do affirmations.

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,159
I like to visualize.

375
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,799
I like to exercise.

376
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,320
I love it.

377
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,399
As a matter of fact,

378
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,440
read,

379
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,879
I love,

380
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,139
love,

381
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,120
love to read.

382
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,100
And then finally I keep journals.

383
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,600
I keep a personal journal.

384
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,899
I keep a log like everybody does on,

385
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:43,480
uh,

386
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,039
you know what my day looks like,

387
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,379
what the week looks like,

388
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:47,740
what the month looks like,

389
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,360
et cetera.

390
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,200
Most successful people do that.

391
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,039
What do you do?

392
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,059
You know,

393
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,600
and then I keep another one where I just,

394
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
or ideas,

395
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,440
you give me something and I'll transition it from success.

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,340
Slave's clue to just a pure book of what I would call ideas or a book.

397
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,799
I like writing poetry.

398
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,639
So,

399
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,840
or a little bit weird,

400
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,919
a little bit different,

401
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,779
but that's my life.

402
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,860
And so my point is,

403
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,919
is that I've given you an,

404
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,500
an acronym of some great habits in there.

405
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:17,940
And you say,

406
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,100
Hey,

407
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,879
that sounds overwhelming to me.

408
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,240
Well then do two of the savers,

409
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,980
because if I stay in your brain,

410
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,279
you say,

411
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:24,460
Hey,

412
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,580
I remember this dude on the podcast mentioned about the miracle morning.

413
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,039
And then he talked about this,

414
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,840
an acronym of savers.

415
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,519
And now I go right to a,

416
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,820
a routine that I personally don't always accomplish,

417
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,759
but I,

418
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,320
I I'm picking off at least three or four of them per day.

419
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,620
I like to get all of them,

420
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,879
but I don't honestly.

421
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,820
And then you go from there,

422
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,980
you build from there.

423
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,100
And before you know it,

424
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,519
before you start your day,

425
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:54,879
you've,

426
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,559
you've already had some major base hits there.

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,000
So that's what I do.

428
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,779
I love,

429
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,100
you know,

430
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,879
the miracle morning.

431
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,620
And I love the,

432
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,480
the,

433
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,379
an acronym and what,

434
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,240
and what it stands for.

435
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:04,539
And I,

436
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,480
I really relate to it too,

437
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,759
Mike,

438
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
in lots of ways.

439
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,179
I want to delve into a bit of it straight away,

440
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,740
if that's can.

441
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:11,940
I mean,

442
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,139
meditation mindfulness now,

443
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:13,580
Mike is,

444
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,659
is really a much more known term and something that athletes consistently do.

445
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,639
I feel really lucky to have found that 25 years ago in the world of AFL football,

446
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,220
which is quite rare in the Western suburbs of Melbourne back in that time,

447
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,779
but the habit forming.

448
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:30,779
And as you said,

449
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,000
you know,

450
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,720
you think of the alternative.

451
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:31,899
Now,

452
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,759
a lot of kids start the day.

453
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,740
First thing you're on the smartphone,

454
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,299
you,

455
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:35,879
you know,

456
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,299
you're over,

457
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
overwhelmed with all of this material.

458
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,919
And that's the first thing that you do that,

459
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:41,279
you know,

460
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,500
and to not exercise,

461
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,639
to not give you your mind that think time or to not read for,

462
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
for better learning.

463
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,159
So,

464
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,700
so much wisdom in,

465
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,639
in what you say,

466
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:49,799
what,

467
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,220
what type of meditation do you,

468
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:52,720
do you prefer Mike?

469
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,659
Do you mix it up or.

470
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,039
Hey,

471
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,320
you know,

472
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,940
there are a couple of favorites,

473
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,740
but what's awesome on the topic of the cell phone and then the meditation is,

474
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,920
is that with today's youth,

475
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,660
the cell phone is such an attribute,

476
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,500
but it's got to have a discipline to it.

477
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,519
So we have a no phone zone at certain times during the day.

478
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,859
It could be the dinner table or it could be the coach says,

479
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,160
Hey,

480
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:19,920
you know,

481
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,660
put a leash on that and put it in your bag and then see it post game.

482
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,319
But whatever the philosophy is of that building or that adult,

483
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,180
but the main point about the cell phone is it's not the enemy,

484
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,900
but like anything,

485
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,740
it is a secondary to the importance of who you are,

486
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,779
how you act and what you do.

487
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,259
And if you let the phone,

488
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,500
it will end up controlling you versus you controlling it.

489
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,180
And that's why I say,

490
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,380
you've got to put a leash on it.

491
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:52,099
You got,

492
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,599
you've got to get it in its proper place.

493
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,440
And if you start with young adults or anybody else and say,

494
00:17:59,559 --> 00:17:59,700
Hey,

495
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,579
it's the enemy.

496
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,259
And then you,

497
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,799
then you sound like you're 9,000 years old.

498
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,900
And so I think a better,

499
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,920
a better way to approach young adults and,

500
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,220
and footy players and whomever is,

501
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:11,420
Hey,

502
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,700
man,

503
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,400
isn't it great.

504
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,460
Look what it does.

505
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,319
But then you have to have an etiquette to the phone,

506
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,079
the phone.

507
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,380
I mean,

508
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,920
it's ridiculous at restaurants when you go in and,

509
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,599
you know,

510
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,079
the heads down and nobody's conversing and conversation takes a secondary

511
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,180
interactions,

512
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,180
relationships,

513
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,279
all of that.

514
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:29,680
It's a,

515
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,019
it's a mechanism for people to hide,

516
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,740
to shield themselves,

517
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,900
to knock,

518
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,740
communicate.

519
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,700
And I,

520
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,660
and I always just tell 10 people,

521
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,700
if you're in a room,

522
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,279
if you understand that about the phone,

523
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,359
then you're going to understand that you can get an edge every day.

524
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,640
If you know how to use the phone to your benefit,

525
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,319
but the phone can be a really negative thing.

526
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,720
Okay.

527
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,400
How is it a positive thing to meditation is there's over seven or 800.

528
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,519
All you have to do is Google and go,

529
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,019
I want a 10 minute meditation.

530
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,400
I want a 20 minute meditation.

531
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,299
Or a longer meditation and you can go potpourri and it just comes up.

532
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,319
You scroll and you pick what you want.

533
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,119
Personally.

534
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,180
I like one that's 18 minutes and it's waves.

535
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,480
And it's an Australian who takes you through and get you to your subconscious.

536
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,539
And he goes through four or five markers.

537
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,559
And I would say I've listened to it a thousand times already.

538
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,779
In other words,

539
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,980
it fits me.

540
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,859
And I'm not a guy who has to look over the phone.

541
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:36,440
It fits me.

542
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:36,920
And I'm not a guy who has to look over the phone.

543
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,079
It fits me.

544
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,279
And I'm not a guy who has to look over the phone.

545
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:37,299
I'm not a guy who has to look over the phone.

546
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:37,359
It fits me.

547
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,359
If you talk to any monk or anybody who talks about the flywheel or the

548
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,059
simplicity of the hedgehog,

549
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
learn how to do one thing.

550
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,740
Great.

551
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,519
Jim Collins,

552
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,319
good to great,

553
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,160
et cetera.

554
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:53,000
He also wrote built to last a dynamic speaker around the world.

555
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,099
But the bottom line is,

556
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,339
is that what you're trying to do is not do a thousand things.

557
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,619
Well,

558
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:01,599
you're trying to do one thing extremely well,

559
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,940
find your passion and then just keep hitting a button.

560
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:05,839
And the next thing you know,

561
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:12,339
people are giving you money. It's ridiculous. But to have the discipline to go to the same

562
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:18,759
meditation and to drill down on it and find iterations and different avenues of what that

563
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:26,259
man is saying to you or what you can expound upon within your own imagination is timeless

564
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:32,460
and unbelievable. Now, I went existential on most of your audience. I'll bring myself back.

565
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:41,019
But you've got 700 or 800 of those on Google at least that will take you to another 700 if you're

566
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:49,200
really adventurous and want to find a meditation. But just go to Google and just type in meditation

567
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,519
and it'll give you any kind, standing on your head, laying down, swimming. I mean, it's ridiculous.

568
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,180
So anyway, mine's an 18-minute shot. I find that that fits my day. And, you know,

569
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,259
you know, I'm kind of like this. Got it done. I feel good about that part. But there's other

570
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,700
things to do. Yeah, I was taught mantra-based transcendental meditation, which has stayed with

571
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,099
me. But you're right. And I love your language there around putting the leash on the phone. And

572
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,359
as a father of four, I think it's the parenting conversation we have all the time around,

573
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,700
you know, it's the number one driver. But I think you're right. When you demonize it,

574
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,160
you underestimate how brilliant. I love how the kids connect. I love how they can get together.

575
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,339
It's so much simpler than we grew up.

576
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,319
But having some boundaries. And so the Milwaukee Bucks, you'll have times where

577
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,940
the players will say, hey, it's dinner time or meal time. Put your phones in your bag.

578
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,099
You guys put some leash around that even at NBA level.

579
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,359
Yes. I think everything is about understanding that freedom is responsibility and responsibility

580
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:55,420
is freedom. You know, when over in the United States, they have graduation talks all the time.

581
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,599
And there's a guy that is a brilliant writer called David Brooks. He wrote The Second Mountain.

582
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,299
But anyway, he talks about...

583
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,920
All these fancy people, whether it's Bill Gates or it could be, you know, this guy or this woman

584
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:15,559
who has a resume that weighs not, you know, it's hefty and they're brilliant people and all that.

585
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:23,259
But they get up there and they tell an audience of 1,000 students that are 21 years old that are,

586
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,720
you know, literally crapping their pants, wondering what the heck they're going to do

587
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,240
with their lives. And they're saying, hey, you be you. Find your passion. Well, what they're doing

588
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,440
is they're going to do it. And they're going to do it. And they're going to do it. And they're

589
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,799
just throwing gasoline on the fire. They're not giving them anything that's credible to,

590
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,319
hey, tell me what to do in the next six months. They don't want to know what to do with the rest

591
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:49,140
of their life. They just want to not be scared. Because I know I was sitting in that chair and

592
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,980
I talked to my buddies and we were all sitting there having a beer after graduation. I have

593
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:02,180
no idea what I'm going to do. And my point is that it's really important that

594
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,440
each day that we connect with simple things and understand that the complex, if you're a good

595
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:17,519
teacher, a good leader, is to boil it down and hand them out, help people understand that,

596
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:24,519
you know, you being you and freedom has a responsibility attached to it. The phone

597
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:31,960
has a responsibility attached to it. The more you can teach a younger person. My father made me

598
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,819
and we had five of us. We had to start buying our clothes in the sixth grade. If we needed a little

599
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:43,660
help here or there. Yeah. But you are. And it was custom in our home to start buying our clothes in

600
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,180
the sixth grade. Well, that meant that you had to paint finishes. You had to cut lawn. You had to

601
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,259
have a job. That was just a given in today's age. I don't care if it's the AFL. And now you've got

602
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:01,200
18 to 20, 22 year olds. You say, raise your hand if you've had a job. And you would be stunned by

603
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,259
the fact that the majority of the room, they've never worked a job or paid taxes or done whatever.

604
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,819
So it just means that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world. It's what you're inheriting

605
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:19,259
are a lot of people that have not taken traditional steps to the word responsibility.

606
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,559
And when you have a human being that says, give me, give me, give me entitlement,

607
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,299
it doesn't make them awful. What it means is somebody didn't teach them that.

608
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,579
And so instead of indictment judgment, you say, okay, this is what I've got. And this is where

609
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:43,140
we've got to go. And anybody can, you know, take somebody that's gifted, that's been disciplined

610
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:50,619
by great parents. But can you take somebody that's talented, that's lazy, or hasn't been taught

611
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:57,779
properly or has an abusive father and lead them to a higher plateau where they say, hey, that's

612
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,240
not proper to slap a woman.

613
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,480
No, we don't do that. We never do that. And here's why, you know, and then you go down that road,

614
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,519
but their model and what they saw in the home was opposite that. Well, you're not going to fix that

615
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:18,079
young man in a day or a week. You have to understand it's going to take a process.

616
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,440
Well, it's the same thing as the phone, or it's the same thing as freedom.

617
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:29,380
Freedom is an arduous process. That is not a give me thing. It is actually

618
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,900
I've got to do A to B to C, and then the door of freedom opens up.

619
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,700
Yeah, brilliantly said, Mike. I love listening to the way you eloquently describe the pathway

620
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,200
to success. And as you said, you can sit there in front of someone who's, you know, as you said,

621
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,440
got a hefty resume. And I remember sitting there, how is it even possible to even look at that? But,

622
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,319
you know, when you break it down, I go back to the miracle morning. If you start your day with

623
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,279
some reflection and some mindfulness and some exercise and some effort, you're going to be

624
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,799
and some visualization and some journaling, you're probably going to be on the path to finding

625
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,900
that yourself. And so, yeah, incredibly brilliant the way that you've summed that up. I want to

626
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,740
change tack, Mike. There's so much to talk to you about and go to a moment in your life where

627
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,519
the greatest athlete on the planet, maybe the greatest athlete in history, Michael Jordan,

628
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,099
owns his own NBA team. He's the majority shareholder of Charlotte Bobcats, now the

629
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:30,279
Charlotte Hornets. Can you tell us about that phone call, that experience when you take the

630
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,660
NBA senior role and clearly linked to Michael Jordan's going to be a unique experience?

631
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,819
Well, it was, I would just say, you know, working threes because people can digest threes.

632
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,299
Really, because your question begs, what's it like to be in a room with him? And, you know,

633
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:55,119
what makes him tick? And being in a room with them is he's really aware, he has a sixth sense

634
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,259
about the dynamics of people. And he was a tremendous,

635
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:07,740
is a tremendous leader and has, I would say, good humility given the accolades of being

636
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:15,579
bestowed and earning that as the greatest player in a sport. You know, there are others,

637
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,759
but he's definitely at the top. And some people want to argue it. That's fine.

638
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:26,759
But definitely he's right up there with top two or three. And then the argument stops.

639
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,599
But,

640
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:37,559
I would say that everybody that ever watched him play highly, highly competitive. And, you know,

641
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:43,599
people will say, okay, he's competitive, but what does that mean? He's thorough. When he's trying

642
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,140
to be a great owner, whether he's trying to win a golf game or what he did with basketball is,

643
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:57,079
is that he has a flame within him that if he walks in a room, he has presence. And it,

644
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:04,319
it's about competing. I mean, he would show up to anything and ultimately he's going to turn it

645
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,640
into competition. He can't help himself. And that's, he's a warrior competitor and he's going

646
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:19,220
to turn a party into competition. It could be quarters. It could be a conversation, but so that

647
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:26,400
stands out. You know, so I would say presence, competitor, and then three, you know, three is,

648
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,079
like, a box for him.

649
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,019
You're going to have to make flexible decisions. You're going to have to whether you're going

650
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:29,700
to get a promotion or a promotion is, is what you need. So I think it's the first way to

651
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,839
do that.

652
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,839
And the, the one that comes up here is I would say he's a good partner with Michael Jordan,

653
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,319
which he tries to keep veiled, but he's service related. He gives a ton of money that's not

654
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:43,359
tagged, Michael Jordan money, to a lot of African-American colleges in America, not just one.

655
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:51,700
All right. He's got a hundred million dollars tagged over the next decade to go to educational

656
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,759
programs and scholarship programs.

657
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,000
My point is, is that there is a degree,

658
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,079
of humility and he doesn't want that to boomerang back him look at me look what i'm doing but the

659
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:10,180
big point there on point number three is he's community uh related and he wants to impact and

660
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,160
he's impacted charlotte you know not only with the employment of more than a thousand people

661
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,460
in his building and what the hornets mean to the community but he also takes his stack of money

662
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:31,200
and gives it away quietly quietly so those are the three things that in presence of of mj that

663
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,880
that were noticeable to me there's more and more and more of stories and this that and the other

664
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,720
thing but to highlight that is presence competitor and community related so mike to sort of uh you

665
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,259
know reflect the the documentary that he produced was uh you know again everything he does becomes

666
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,440
uh you know bigger than

667
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,039
anything previously and that that you know without understanding the netflix numbers is a global

668
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,819
phenomenon and people then got a look on the inside at that last year of michael jordan and

669
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:11,180
and him sitting down reflecting back i mean a remarkable thing and a time piece to have in lots

670
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,900
of ways but i think all of us then got a sense of just the drive and and then also perhaps that you

671
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,859
know again the the bar room conversation you know did he end up with great camaraderie with his

672
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,279
teammates

673
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,279
going for was that a cost of doing business to be that good i mean how did you reflect on looking at

674
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,839
that did you think well that's just his path to being the best of all time or is did that come at

675
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,579
a cost in some way in your mind looking at that as well it always comes at a cost for everybody

676
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:46,019
you know leadership is a lonely role and it's not for everybody and so if you think you're going to

677
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:52,720
sit in that chair and you know be all things to all people you're sadly mistaken and you've never

678
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,440
sat in a chair you're not going to be in that chair you're not going to be in that chair you're not

679
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:01,019
you know whether you're running your own company uh that's a high-end company elite and you're

680
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:07,720
wanting to be the best there's a price to be paid he paid the price uh at the moment you know when

681
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:15,460
he was running down the trail and he was a bull i would say the com the camaraderie was contentious

682
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:21,319
at times but there are other times where he went out with his team he paid for the bills they had

683
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,259
a great state etc.

684
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,420
and they had a really good time but the vapor of that um was an indictment on that he was a rough

685
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:41,180
neck and that you know he was hard to be around uh at times uh it's complicated but i would say

686
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:48,240
that i'm on the side of of of mj you know he didn't hesitate in the documentary to say this

687
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,440
is who i was this is what i did and i thought some of the things that were said about him

688
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:00,400
were cowardly you know and and i'll say it to pippin i'll say it to bj armstrong or whatever

689
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,680
not that they didn't shouldn't have their opinion but you know fly and go see him in his living room

690
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,920
and break it down for him you know easy to be filmed and say that and they wouldn't have said

691
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,359
it the same way had they been in his presence and so my point is that i'm for him because

692
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,440
if you're gonna say what you're gonna say you're gonna say what you're gonna say you're gonna say

693
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:30,680
what you said and the way you said it then give the rings to him because you know i think that

694
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:40,180
also is that phil jackson allowed and wanted him to do part of of of phil jackson's job

695
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:47,039
you know some of the admonishing and going harder and hey that's not good enough should

696
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,700
have been in phil jackson's lap not jordan's but jordan took over and

697
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,440
he

698
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:02,359
you know six championships etc and everybody said he was the lead dog well when 10 or 20 years goes

699
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:10,640
by you got to understand that you can't have just all good you know there's a trade-off and if you

700
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,000
want those rings and want to look at them and brag about them and that you got to understand

701
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,619
that the lead dog did his job did he not did he not do his job did he do his job he did his job

702
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:23,059
better than anyone's ever done it before mike and i

703
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:23,440
and i

704
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,779
they fall very much into your cab and i think imagine the privilege of being a teammate imagine

705
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,859
being swept up on that train it would have been brilliant and as you said everything comes at a

706
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:38,119
cost i think i i you know wrote that down again and i bring it back to an australian connection

707
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,619
for me i look longley was part of that and as australians we got to live through the

708
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:47,420
chicago bull era and and through luke longley and uh who didn't feature heavily but i did see

709
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,299
a lot of people won't understand this michael jordan sat down with uh the uh abc afterwards

710
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,720
and uh i'm having trouble thinking of the uh australian story is the um famous program that

711
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,359
does documentary type story and he sat down with them and as you said in terms of curry and said

712
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,440
hey look you know what if i look back we probably did miss out on it but we're filming a documentary

713
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,659
you can't tell every part of it and luke was a big part of uh of the team and i'd go and play

714
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,179
with luke any time again was that was the words that that he used so uh you know i think um i

715
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,420
think it's a it's a brilliant well the the great thing about luke longley

716
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,440
is what he's done is he's done a lot of work and he's done a lot of work and he's done a lot of work

717
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:30,400
he was a piece of clay and if we're talking directly about jordan jordan said here's here's

718
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,400
the road that we're going to travel hold on to my hand and i'll take you to a place that you've

719
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,940
never been before and luke would admit that and um so jordan was the bright light in the room

720
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:52,139
and you know there's there it's not all going to be peaches and cream and when you are a dynasty

721
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,780
it is the hardest thing in the world to do and if it were easy everybody be doing it and the thing

722
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:08,719
that that excellence and living a one percent life means that four in the morning is four in the

723
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:16,019
morning you know i was at an ice cream shop below a hotel in the basement and there's a guy named

724
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:22,000
marinovich who's a famous weight coach for pro athletes he had a son that played at usc and

725
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
went on to play and he was a great athlete and he was a great athlete and he was a great athlete and

726
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:32,239
a very controversial life and and for the raiders etc nonetheless is and the ice cream shop was a

727
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:39,179
napkin that had jordan's autograph on it and said have a great day something along those lines and

728
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:45,940
that led me down the down the basement corridor to the weight room and he said whenever jordan

729
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:52,820
came in to anaheim he would lift on game day here and the things that he did

730
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,440
was

731
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:02,699
his weight coach on game day were crazy you know he was doing supersets squats lunges and the whole

732
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:11,599
thing and that the point of that is is that jordan tortured himself to be the best of the best

733
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:20,260
and when you get into that thin air it's really hard to explain to anybody who's never lived

734
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,440
the 4 a.m life and the 16

735
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:32,019
to 18 hour day and the pressure of the media and holding form when you're injured and to do that

736
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:40,059
and be number one i don't care who you investigate whether it's steve jobs or it's bill gates or

737
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:45,980
whatever they all have their pimples they all have their pimples but when you look at their

738
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,159
work day when you look at their ability that they see life differently and they have the discipline

739
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,440
of free time to start working and they have the discipline of free time to start working and they

740
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:01,159
say no i'm not going to do that no i'm not not going to do that that you know it time will speak

741
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:10,699
for eternity on how remarkable michael jordan is and was and will be uh and a standard for all time

742
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:18,539
i mean that bill russell same deal standard for all time donald bradman standard for all time

743
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,239
those things are hard you know to do and as you know you can name

744
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:32,239
the best footy players that ever played the game very robin i mean you know there it is i mean

745
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:38,039
there are only so many greats out there and it comes at a severe price yeah that's why we love

746
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:43,760
understanding that genius isn't or trying to and you you describe jordan as the bright light in the

747
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,320
room the bright light in the room you're probably around in the nba at the moment janice added a

748
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,900
who was a two-time nba mvp delivered

749
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,840
is uh the mvp of the final series uh 2021 for milwaukee's second ever championship uh

750
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,519
has he got that that sort of genius we just heard you talk about is he in that sort of conversation

751
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:13,719
yeah he'll he'll move himself uh to you know in the conversation of the top five in the next

752
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:19,820
couple years if injury doesn't visit his doorstep or everybody knock on wood but

753
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,440
yes i mean if there's no question he's 6 11

754
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:30,519
he does things on the court that nobody has ever done uh other than maybe as an athlete

755
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:38,519
wilt chamberlain uh was the only one uh in terms of stride distance is a is a kind of a scientific

756
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:47,400
thing but um he he he has things that he does both physically and mentally and spiritually that are

757
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,440
at the highest level i mean as a competitor he's like george

758
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:01,840
uh physically the ball in his hand is like a golf ball that's how big his hand is his arms are

759
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:11,320
seven four you know uh all of that stuff that so he has the physical attributes and then the his

760
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:19,579
free time is consumed in the weight room uh consumed with shooting uh practice uh another

761
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:23,440
session of stretching and then he does a mental session every day and then he does a physical

762
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,820
day uh with our sports psychologist uh he's willing to pay the price to have his name

763
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,400
eventually put up there with the greats uh mike it's uh it's a great insight we appreciate it and

764
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,460
also a great reflection clearly on the culture you've got at milwaukee you know to keep a player

765
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,679
of that quality he's been there for nine years you know the world would be at his door enticing

766
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,920
him elsewhere i mean can you speak to to that culture that's a significant achievement to keep

767
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,760
him at your club for such a long time yeah that the milwaukee bucks whether it's john horst our

768
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:08,000
general manager our owners uh or everybody else our medical people uh coach bud jason kidd before

769
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,239
him all of that is a village as they say that that connected with him and what the people would

770
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,900
probably want to ask or know well what what was the one thread that maybe made

771
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,920
him go small market and be loyal and it was the fact that he was in abject poverty

772
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,119
sold sunglasses along with his brothers in order to give money back to his family so they could eat

773
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:44,019
uh so doing that at a young age gave him a love for stability and he understood the underdog the

774
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:51,139
small market you have to have uh an ability not to want to go to new york or miami

775
00:40:51,900 --> 00:41:01,380
or la the easy road um he was raised hard uh he you know like i said he had a job that taught him

776
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:09,480
how to work hard and also is somewhere along the line his mother and his father taught him the value

777
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,960
of loyalty and what he's getting back from the community of and the city of milwaukee is

778
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,880
wherever he goes he is loved and

779
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,940
he has a set of manners on him he understands that you know he was given something by the stars

780
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,199
and he's going to take full advantage of it but if you said what's the one thing away from

781
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:40,780
the physical attributes that he has is that it he is an incredibly humble human being

782
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,800
and has a set of manners on him yes sir no sir i don't care who's talking to him

783
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,719
and whenever he warms up uh uh at home or on the road we have ball boys that

784
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,599
he actually has the best leave of the day i mean i just i think that's incredible how

785
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,400
they get through that the best thing they achieve is

786
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,059
to have a chance at winning the game and winning the most important game and you know he's

787
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:08,199
still a youngster he's got a you know he's a youngster the kids can be very young at

788
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:11,179
home so i'm going to have to give him aentaric um i think he's going to be a youngster

789
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:15,500
uh so i'm going to give him a little extra and um i'm not just saying i know i'm a youngster

790
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,260
but i'm a youngster if i'm a well-mannered man i'm a youngster then i'm going to give

791
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,199
him a chance to play in the game i think he's gonna be a youngster in the future uh so

792
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:21,739
yeah i mean there we go

793
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:21,860
um

794
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,019
was based on a partnership with one of my oldest friends, Matt Waterwitz, in a leadership

795
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:31,699
business we founded called Alita, and our signature program is Alita Connect, and we're

796
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,139
really passionate about collaborative groups of leaders from different backgrounds getting

797
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:40,039
together, and it was your great friend Brian Gorgian, who's got a huge reputation in Australia

798
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:45,739
for his incredible legacy with Australian basketball and sport, and referred you into

799
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:50,000
the world, and the fact that you can hear the lifelong learning in your language, you're

800
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,599
constantly open to learning, and you've collaborated with some of our great Australian coaches

801
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,880
in recent times, Craig McRae is doing an incredible job at Collingwood, Andrew McDonald, Anthony

802
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,320
Seabold, John Aloisi from the world of the round ball game, can you tell us about your

803
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,340
passion to get together and connect with other leaders?

804
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,800
Yeah, back to Brian Gorgian, if you guys, and you probably already know this, but if

805
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,800
you do your homework, take every coach that's ever coached in the history of your land,

806
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,860
and he's number one, I'm talking tennis, I'm talking Charlie Walsh, I'm talking Lindsey

807
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:36,579
Gaze, nobody has a better win percentage or more wins than Brian Gorgian, and the only

808
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:44,539
reason I mention that is, is that I played for his father, and at 21, I started going

809
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:49,980
over to Australia and working in Albert Park, over in a corner with some of his players,

810
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,380
and that blossomed into working and being the head coach of the Adelaide 36ers, I was

811
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:03,820
fortunate enough to be there three years, but my point is that, you know, I have great

812
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:09,380
friends, and your selection of friends is everything about who you are, and even being

813
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:16,619
with, and I don't mean that even being, but with Matt, he has opened the door to the best

814
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,619
of the best in Australia, and young coaches that are actually...

815
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,980
I mean, you know, I've been in the theatre now, I jumped on that, Brian provided that

816
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:31,559
for me, and so, I want to give credit to Brian and Matt for bringing me to you, Luke, so

817
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:38,179
thank you, but I'm just a hunter of people, I don't think you have enough friends, I've

818
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:43,340
heard people say, I have enough friends, or the ones I really trust, I can count on one

819
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,980
hand, I'm not that guy, I don't believe that, I want to keep opening new cupboards, and

820
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,840
to new friends, because I think there's an energy to it, there's a warmth to it, and

821
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,260
I would tell every coach, as you age, start collecting younger and younger friends, you

822
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:08,139
know, as a coach of college, I was always working between 18 and 22, basically, so I

823
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:13,760
was infused with youth my whole life, and so I have all, and they're going to have marriages,

824
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,739
they're going to have kids, and so I'm going to all these weddings and stuff, you know,

825
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,760
as somebody...

826
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,780
I mean, who's now 65, but my point is, is that Pete Newell, who was a great, great basketball

827
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,559
coach, at the same level as John Wood, he's Mount Rushmore coach, in terms of what he

828
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:39,199
did and all that, I worked his big man camp for 20 years, but the one lesson he taught

829
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,320
me is, he said, young man, having lunch with him, he said, the one thing I'm going to give

830
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,619
you as a gift is this, you listen to me, you're going to be fine, you don't, you're going

831
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:49,780
to augment...

832
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,300
and become old and bitter, keep an open mind, he said, when you go to a clinic, or you watch

833
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:03,079
somebody, have a notebook, pay homage to them, ask them questions, never think you know it

834
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,679
all, and if they're telling you something you already know, write it again, because

835
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:14,619
it'll reinforce what eventually you'll forget, and I'm just sitting there, and I said, it,

836
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,619
you know, like, I'm meeting you today for the first time, it's another opportunity for

837
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,340
me to learn, and that's the way I look at it, and then the second admonition is, as you

838
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,179
get older, you are your experiences, and then you always want to talk about yesterday, and

839
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:35,840
I think, again, you have to flush that stuff, and codify it, and put it on a bookshelf,

840
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,440
and say, I don't know anything, whenever I walk into a room, first thing I say to myself,

841
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:46,699
I don't know anything, and I always say, that person and that person's smarter than me,

842
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,699
and it's a really great place to start.

843
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,139
Because it puts the antennas up, and you're willing to listen to a seven-year-old say

844
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:03,119
something that is profound, Forrest Gump-like, or it's somebody that is talking, and you think,

845
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,820
well, because they have never won a national championship or world championship, why bother?

846
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,059
Hey, that's ridiculous.

847
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:18,440
I went to a class, my wife stimulated this, but in love and logic, I tell coaches all the time,

848
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,860
the best class.

849
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,440
The best coach you can ever go to is never the greatest coach of all time, it's parenting class,

850
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:31,440
because in love and logic, whoever is up there, it's their 1200th class, so that means that

851
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:39,039
they're teaching something in terms of concepts, and they've dealt with trouble and problems

852
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:47,599
for 1200 classes, and so they're dealing with methodology of raising children, and so I had

853
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,760
no idea about phases of children.

854
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,820
The fair phase, the phase where the shutout phase, daughter to mother, here it happens at this time,

855
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,260
here it comes, where the father has to enter and be there on site for two years, I had no clue of

856
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,380
any of this stuff, but then if you understand parenting, then you're going to understand

857
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:16,119
any player that comes across your radar, and they don't all come across, I, sir, they're going to

858
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,980
come across troubled, they're going to come across as a different learner, they're going

859
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,480
to come across with a whole host of things where you say, I don't understand them, why won't they

860
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:33,300
run hard, and then now you go to somebody and say, oh, I see what's going on, there's something that

861
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,800
they came to the paddock with that's a problem, so now I'm just going to start giving them a hard

862
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,760
one, and yet they have something there, it doesn't mean I'm going to give them an out, but how about

863
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,420
we call them, the assistants take over, and I put my arm around, and I say, hey, you know, Graham,

864
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,780
what happened out there, you know, and then he says, hey, you know, my girlfriend did this,

865
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,559
and say, hey, we're going to get to that later, and I'm going to take you to lunch,

866
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:09,699
but that's no excuse for going from A to B, because you wouldn't allow that with a high-risk

867
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:13,500
surgeon who's going to work on your son, what's he going to start talking to you about the fact

868
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:19,139
that his wife served him papers for a divorce, so he's going to stop surgery on you, I mean, come on,

869
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:19,920
and so

870
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,500
I mean, this is the kind of thing you have to be aware of, and it all goes back to,

871
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:32,380
am I a good learner, and am I open to the fact that if you want to know how somebody operates,

872
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:39,400
there's a whole nother world underneath that are called triggers, where you hear them speak,

873
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,900
and you go, okay, there's something else I need to get to, hey, I noticed that you said this word

874
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,920
over here, like you were struggling with getting your

875
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,780
car going, you know, whatever that was, well, what did that struggle, I mean, what's that about,

876
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,460
well, I'm behind on my bills, you are, well, what are you doing with your money, man, you got plenty

877
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:07,380
of money, and now he says, well, you know, I really like the casino, oh, okay, all right,

878
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:15,239
so my point is that there's always another investigation to be done, and you have to be

879
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,539
open to people who will help and know more than you,

880
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,679
in almost every aspect of life, and that's where you go, and you ask questions, and you listen,

881
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,059
you button your mouth, and let them teach you. I love the brilliance of what you said, Mike,

882
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,739
it relates clearly, you know, in sport, dealing with athletes, but in anyone who might be running

883
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,260
a business, listening to this, or anyone who's managing people, you're not forgiving the behavior

884
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,739
of A to B, as you said, but we're going to acknowledge that, and we need to work on that,

885
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:47,940
but let's also find out personally, because all of us have a bad day with a partner, all of us,

886
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,980
you know, make a mistake at some point.

887
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,260
Whatever area of our life, and so, you know, it's where the opportunity is, and, you know,

888
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,599
we're coming back without the name-dropping element to this, Mike, because I know the

889
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,340
humility is, but you have opened up this world of connection, and I love it, and I do it for

890
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:10,400
a reason as well, because when people, you know, your schedule at the Milwaukee Bucks doesn't

891
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:15,440
lend itself, you would think, to self-reflect and take the time, but you're now, you know,

892
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,500
connecting in to Matt LaFleur, who's the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who's one of the

893
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,340
most revered coaches, Mikel Arteta from Arsenal, I know you've got another collaborative group

894
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,019
going, George Carl, who's obviously a great mentor and friend of yours, Eddie Jones from

895
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:33,579
English Rugby, so the fact, and we just get as excited, Mike, as someone who is running a small

896
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:38,260
business with two people in it, who wants to get together and continue that learning journey and

897
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,820
share with others, and these brilliant young female leaders that, in their 20s, that we're

898
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,639
learning from, who are doing things that we couldn't have even dreamed about, and so, for us,

899
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:49,980
our passion is connecting, and collecting was probably the most important thing for us.

900
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,420
The wrong word, but in some ways, it is these groups of people who want to reflect and learn,

901
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:59,599
and so, when people like you do it, who've had success, it really does, I think, offer a window

902
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,559
into lifelong learning, as you said, and your story about keeping an open mind, you know,

903
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:10,260
really resonates, so thank you for, A, joining the world we love of a leader, but also your input

904
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:16,619
and your knowledge has been clearly profound, so thanks again. Mike, we've been, for us,

905
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,980
identifying what we think great leadership looks like in the context of,

906
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,940
of the people we've had this great privilege of working with, and spending time with, like you,

907
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,820
and we think, for us, there are dimensions that are really clear coming out. The first one is

908
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:35,480
self-leadership, that we think most leaders have a real sense of self-leadership. Does that term

909
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:42,039
resonate with you? Yeah, I mean, accountability. When you say self-leadership is, the doorway

910
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:49,980
has got to be being accountable to walking your talk, cliche, but you definitely,

911
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,920
have to provide an example, as, as people are digging in for a long run with you, and it could

912
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:03,760
be 25-year business, could be 40 years, etc., is that the connector would be that you have an

913
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,659
employee, and their child goes to the hospital because they got burned, or whatever. There is

914
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:18,980
no excuse for the leader, either, you know, using Zoom, FaceTime, or going to the hospital

915
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,980
to see that.

916
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,880
That child, to show that kind of love, if you will, that, yeah, we have a bottom line, and we

917
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,679
want to make money, but intrinsically, if you want to connect with somebody forever, those are

918
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:40,420
actions, not words, and so self-leadership is about what you do, not what you say.

919
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:52,340
We see leaders, another dimension, are really conscious now, and we've heard that in your

920
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,380
already, about how they positively impact people in their environment. You just shared a story,

921
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,199
of doing that in real time, that idea of positively impacting others on a daily basis,

922
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,099
Mike, does that resonate as well? Say that one again, please.

923
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:11,460
Positively impacting others in your environment, leaders conscious of, you know, really sophisticated

924
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,900
about how they, on a day-to-day basis, have a positive impact, is that something you've given

925
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:22,780
thought to? Yeah, the aura of being positive is validating the negative. In other words,

926
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,380
it'll fizzle out extrinsically on the person,

927
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,300
if it's just happy days, and you bypass their suffering. Every one of your workers,

928
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:41,280
every one of your players, has something going on that isn't pleasant, and to assume the other

929
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,099
thing, and be, you know, throwing bouquets of flowers all the time, well, they will die and

930
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:53,280
wilt. It's imperative, then, in order to be that, and have great energy, that you be empathetic,

931
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,380
and have compassion, and yet you have to get to,

932
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,679
hey, look, we've got to hump it today, and we've got to get going, you know, but I think that the

933
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:08,340
positivity is a validation of, hey, this is going to be hard today. This is hard, because you've got

934
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:14,159
something else going on, but yes, we can, and yes, we will, and then you roll up your sleeves,

935
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:23,539
and whatever that is, they see you also as a hard worker, as somebody who's not hypocritical,

936
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,380
et cetera, because as a leader,

937
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,880
your talent has to be to delegate. I mean, you know, when I say hard worker,

938
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:39,260
if you're constantly down in the engine room, then you have no sight of where the ship is going,

939
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:45,179
and so you have to, you know, modulate. You have to be up there, then you kind of got to move

940
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:49,900
down there, get into the boiler room, be empathetic, validate, and then say, hey,

941
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:55,920
that's a great job, especially when things are good. We call it praise, prompt, and lead.

942
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,380
The prompt is, you know, you've got to be up there, you've got to be up there, you've got to

943
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:02,079
say, hey, there's what you did with the shovel to get the coal in the stove. Let me show you a

944
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,920
better way, you know, and now you show it, so you're kind of being critical, because you say

945
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,920
you've got a better way. He might slope his shoulders, or she might slope her shoulders,

946
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,500
and so you have to say, hey, you see that body language there? That's not going to play well,

947
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:23,360
because we're going to move through a couple buyers here, and so we need to have a better

948
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,360
shoulders back, eyes up, greet them. You're important. You're important. You're important.

949
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:32,019
And I think you're damn good at what you do. I think you're the best, but I'm going to tell you

950
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:36,380
right now, you've got to do better with those shoulders back, and give me some eye contact.

951
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,280
We got that? Boom, and then walk away from them. You don't have to sit there and admonish them,

952
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:45,800
and you praised them, you gave them a compliment, you prompted them, you told them, and showed them

953
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,920
what you want, and now get away from them, you know, and so those are all methodologies. So

954
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,340
positivity sounds good, but it's amoeba-like, and you have to be more specific,

955
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:03,559
with it, and you have to have techniques and skills in order to distribute it so that it's

956
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:08,619
not just a puff of smoke. Brilliant. I love that idea of validating the negative, isn't it? Because

957
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:14,559
that false positivity, yeah, people see through that, you know, really quickly, and I love your

958
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:20,320
method of being able to deliver it in that particular way. Leaders we see, you know, in

959
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,239
this 21st century style who have great impact like you, are really conscious about how they create

960
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:31,519
and share their vision. How have you gone about creating and sharing your vision? Well, ask

961
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:39,539
questions. Example given is that if you're, you know, running your own corporation or you're a

962
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:46,420
coach, you know, you go in and you paint your vision, but there's no connection, that you're

963
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:53,539
going to end up a dud. My point is, is that an I am sheet. So now your first meeting, you hand out

964
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,219
an I am sheet to your team.

965
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:02,139
Say six workers, whatever your company, a startup, whatnot. Within the three pages, you say, hey,

966
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:09,239
worst tragedy in your life, favorite possession, favorite food, you know, some of those specific

967
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:14,679
questions that might take you 10 years to learn about your wife. It's amazing. All of a sudden,

968
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:18,079
you know, you're at a party and it's 10 years later and you hear your wife say something,

969
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:22,239
you go, oh, I didn't know that. Well, why the hell did you know that? You know what I'm saying?

970
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,079
Because I think too many times, we don't take

971
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:31,380
inventory. And I think that it's really important one to know how to ask great questions and how to

972
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:37,340
note it before you get started on the vision of here's how I want our family to be. Here are the

973
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:43,440
customs because it has to be collaborative. It's got to be we, not me, all those things that we

974
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,500
know, but you better in this day and age, you better say that this is horizontal leadership.

975
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:54,719
I'll be vertical when you want me to lead because you know what players and employees

976
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:55,219
don't.

977
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:01,179
They don't want horizontal leadership all the time. They want leadership when the storm comes

978
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:08,900
by the leader. And so, I mean, you know, you've got, it's a balance of horizontal and vertical

979
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,360
when the time is right. You know, like I said is, but you want to rotate the leadership. Example

980
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:22,639
given, David Halperstam wrote a book called The 20th Century. He went over to Japan, hung out

981
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,780
for a year, wrote a tiny little book.

982
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:30,159
He's a Pulitzer Prize, you know, he's dead now, but he wrote this book. And in essence,

983
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:37,000
he was saying that the leaders came down on Fridays and that they would be on the conveyor

984
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,639
belt. And then they would sit and have lunch with the guys. So they actually worked the conveyor

985
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:47,159
belt and they said, what idea, how can we take that step out to be more efficient? And then they

986
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:52,840
would go back up to their towers, so to speak, with those ideas of the workers, plus the workers

987
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,219
saw them down there and they got to know their first name.

988
00:59:55,239 --> 01:00:04,719
So when we're talking about, again, methods and how you do that, I think you got to know what

989
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,579
you're doing and you got to be competent, again, about what you're doing and what the vision is.

990
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:14,980
But in saying that it's a we vision, hey, I remember you said that, give credit where credit's

991
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:22,159
due. So like if you're an AFL coach or you're an NBL coach, you get all this information and you

992
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,159
say, hey, I found out a Malcolm Gladwell.

993
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:29,000
Outlier, blank, the tipping point. Those are all books that he wrote.

994
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:35,199
The only thing in all those books, really, that I got from him was common denominators,

995
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:42,239
large amounts of information and saying, hey, what are the four or five bands of they had

996
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:48,800
similar answers all the way through with a tragedy, for example, he's fatherless,

997
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:55,019
he's fatherless, he's fatherless. So they have no model of what it really means.

998
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:00,659
to be a male you know in terms of a responsible male there's a little boy in there and he's got

999
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:08,460
a lot of dysfunction and he now you may be the first person that he's seen that expects him to

1000
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:14,139
be responsible in a way that you're asking him and you're talking about this highfalutin vision

1001
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:19,880
and that poor guy's in there and he's 12 years old even though he's in a 22 year old person's body

1002
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:25,039
I mean you're right how am I going to bridge that gap and what am I going to do to build trust

1003
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:30,920
when everything about the male is trust well all of a sudden you bring in a female as a sports

1004
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:38,019
psychologist and that's his he has a good feeling about well that's an avenue to you know my mother

1005
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:44,280
or a female that helped him and now he's with the sports psychologist and the sports psychologist

1006
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,360
is downloading you not snitching but saying hey you're going about this the wrong way

1007
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:49,860
with you.

1008
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:59,840
With your star player and so my point is the vision has to be inspirational it has to be

1009
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:05,420
like hey we're all competitors does anybody in this room want to be the best of the best

1010
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:11,019
you know and everybody's going to raise their hand on that's a layup well start with things

1011
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:15,760
that are easy inspirationally don't start with something like hey you want to be a hard worker

1012
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,760
I mean you know that's not going to really you know get them going.

1013
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,400
But if you say hey we want to be the best of the best and now let's say you had a champion with you

1014
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,619
on your first meeting and it could be another sport and he takes five minutes right from there

1015
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:36,820
he's a champion hey tell me how it felt when you had the confetti coming down what did what was

1016
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,519
the parade like what was that medal like for you and all of a sudden he starts talking and you

1017
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:48,099
watch the eyes the pupils man they just you know they're like golf balls and then they go to balloons

1018
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,840
and then they go to helium balloons.

1019
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:58,800
I mean my point is is that as you can see I've had the luck of being around Magic Johnson for 10

1020
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:05,360
years I worked his camp I watched him walk in when he was 23 I mean you want to talk about a

1021
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:11,119
thoroughbred that had a sheen on him and the way he did it with the kids and the competing and the

1022
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,079
way he talked and the way he didn't know what he was saying in structure in my opinion of hey

1023
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,800
here's how to do footwork what he did was he

1024
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:26,659
captivated um with somebody who came from abject poverty who had a smile that lit up the earth

1025
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:32,000
and now he all of a sudden he's with a six-year-old and he's you know taking the ball off him giving

1026
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,760
the ball back and all of a sudden there's 500 kids around him and he's high-fiving them and that

1027
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,780
well what's that word that's vision of inspiration and like I said is if you're not inspirational

1028
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,860
get a speaker in front of the group that's inspirational and then go from there but

1029
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,860
ultimately

1030
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,320
that inspiration is going to flare out if you don't go underneath it and say I care about you

1031
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:03,539
for more than a competitor there is the aha moment when all of a sudden that allows you to get

1032
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:09,219
underneath that you say in your first meeting painting the vision hey man close your eyes

1033
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:17,340
we're going to put it through the uprights and it's five four three and all of a sudden you get

1034
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,000
to it and you say can you see it

1035
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:25,139
I can see it can you see it all right and then we've got a lot of work to do open your eyes

1036
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:32,880
boom boom now that's one mechanism of creating a vision and now you have the guy who's won the

1037
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,920
medal behind you to say okay what was your hardest day and all of a sudden he starts talking

1038
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:45,920
about just a monster day of what he did say five eight years ago and they go god dang we already

1039
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,860
did that you know or we're doing it harder than that and then you're like oh my god I can't see it

1040
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:56,400
at. Well, that's good. And if you're not, he is also enhancing the picture of those lock steps

1041
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,579
that you've got to go through in order to put that ball through the uprights. That's pretty cool.

1042
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:09,519
So again, as you can tell, I can go ad nauseum, but it's because of all the other people that

1043
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:15,219
have shown me the way. So much gold everywhere, Mike. Again, I love the IM sheet, isn't it?

1044
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:22,099
You can sort of leapfrog maybe 10 years of trying to get to know. Luke, here's what I

1045
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:28,239
challenge you to do. Make three pages of questions you want to ask your wife. And write the question

1046
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:34,000
down and say, all right, what's your favorite book? Okay. What's your favorite meal? What if

1047
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,500
you had one song and it's the last song you ever listened to, what's it going to be? And you're

1048
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,019
going to get answers off of those three pages of whatever you make up. You can't be wrong.

1049
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:52,820
And I promise you seven of the 10 answers, you didn't know. I promise you. And that's a great

1050
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:58,320
day. That is a great day. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. I can do that today. I've been

1051
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:05,199
married 35 years. And I promise you, if I start making up random questions, really random questions,

1052
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:13,619
I would probably be on the same strike rate. So my point is, dare to be different,

1053
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:15,199
dare to build your own dream.

1054
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:21,920
Dare to say stuff that is outrageous. Hey, if you fall over, it's all part of the process,

1055
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:27,179
but not daring and not dreaming and not going after it, it's bullshit.

1056
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:34,320
I love it. Married 20 years coming up this year. I will take up your challenge. And you're right.

1057
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,619
I've already, there's questions that are coming to mind. There was something I just picked up when

1058
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,960
you were talking about the, I interviewed a brilliant guy that I'm sure you'd be interested,

1059
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,099
Dr. Arnie Rubenstein, who's bringing back rites of passage.

1060
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:50,139
To the Western world, thousands and thousands of years where we're sophisticated, particularly

1061
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:55,559
at bringing boys through because tribes worked out in Arnie's words. He was a GP for 12 years

1062
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:01,119
and saw the trouble with adolescent boys and now also girls that if you didn't usher young boys

1063
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:07,500
into manhood properly, then civilization didn't work. And he was bemoaning the fact that so many

1064
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,920
leaders around the world has still got that childlike way about them. They haven't become

1065
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,179
healthy males and he's got a sophisticated way.

1066
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:17,179
Yeah. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great way of making sure we bring back

1067
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:21,519
those rites of passage. And I saw a language very similar to what you were talking about,

1068
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,940
dealing with athletes that had never been led in a way with a healthy understanding of how it is to

1069
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:33,500
be a proper male in the environment you're talking about. I wanted to move to curiosity because it's

1070
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,539
a word that we see come up with leaders a lot. And I tell you what, the curiosity coming out of

1071
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:45,039
you is explosive. Is that a word that resonates? Yes. I mean, I'm curious about it. I'm curious

1072
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:45,199
about it. I'm curious about it. I'm curious about it. I'm curious about it. I'm curious about it.

1073
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:50,800
I'm curious about you. I'm curious about 20 years. I'm curious about your son, your daughter. I mean,

1074
01:07:51,500 --> 01:08:01,579
yeah, they're noted, first note them, but yes. And asking questions and nurturing questions and

1075
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:08,900
also saying, hey, I don't have the answer to that. Let me go about getting the answer. But the trust

1076
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:14,340
is built on follow through of saying that it took me two weeks to get to the bottom of that.

1077
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:20,760
A week. But the follow through, the act of saying, hey, I went out and I searched that. And here's

1078
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:26,079
what I've gotten. I don't know if it's the right answer. You've got humility in there. You've got

1079
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:35,439
the search. But the key to all of it is follow through. Trust is built on the backs of a woman

1080
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:42,239
of her word, a man of her word. And when your word breaks, it's OK. I mean, it's understandable,

1081
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,600
but not excusable.

1082
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,420
But you say, hey, I let you down here. And so this thing about I'm a man of my word. Really?

1083
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:57,039
Well, let's put the video on you for 20 years and see where you broke it. And everybody does.

1084
01:08:57,159 --> 01:09:03,600
So my point is, your word is your handshake. OK, fine. But where you clench the deal

1085
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,800
is the follow through. OK, I bag the groceries. I'm there. The lady thanks me. And you put the

1086
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,380
groceries in her car. All right. And then she,

1087
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,619
say she gives you five dollars, you know, and she says, thank you. And you look her in the eye

1088
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:24,520
and say, every time you're here, Martha, I got you. All right. So now the third time she comes

1089
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:30,220
through three months later and you don't got her. Well, you know, you broke your word. I mean,

1090
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:35,460
if we look at ourselves in the mirror, it happens all the time. So what you're trying to do is win

1091
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:43,579
the percentages of the follow through. And so, you know, being curious is,

1092
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:51,420
is one thing. But be curious with essence and be curious with purpose. Don't be curious just

1093
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:55,260
because you're going to ask a rhetorical question because you want everybody to think that,

1094
01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:01,020
you know, I'm curious and that means I'm going to be smart. Yeah, you're a smart ass is what you are.

1095
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:09,380
It's it's it's brilliant. The next dimension I wanted to talk to you about, we see leaders

1096
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,760
are really conscious of communicating with clarity. You're an English major.

1097
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,180
You went down a path and, you know, clearly you've got a way of communicating that

1098
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:23,000
is outstanding. How have you thought about that in terms of your leadership?

1099
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:31,579
You already pointed to it, but I think it's it's worth repeating is that it's important

1100
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:36,279
with your language that you understand that it's a tool and you have to have discipline of tongue,

1101
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:43,340
a well-placed F-bomb or BS or whatever. I love it, you know, and I'm I'm not going to be

1102
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:43,579
stocked. I'm not going to be stocked. I'm not going to be stocked. I'm not going to be stocked.

1103
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:51,539
But I have discipline of tongue. If I'm around young ladies and at a party, I'm I have discipline

1104
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:57,939
of mouth. I'm not cursing and I'm not, you know, going to going to just tell a body joke after

1105
01:10:57,939 --> 01:11:04,300
body joke. But a good body joke with everybody leaning in is awesome. You know, so I mean,

1106
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:10,460
you have some schauser to you. I would rather be known as Schauserian and slapstick than I would,

1107
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,439
you know, like, oh, aren't I witty? You know, I,

1108
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:13,579
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1109
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:20,760
I know there's a place for wit, but I'm not that guy. But, you know, offer me red wine. I can drink

1110
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,899
it. But if you say, hey, I'd rather have a beer and a barbie. That's, I mean, to each his own.

1111
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:33,659
And yet I can dress up and, and, and, and, and have a pinfold grange with anybody, you know,

1112
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:40,720
who could and who wouldn't. But my, my, my point is that I think that you, you have to modulate

1113
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,420
with your language, language,

1114
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:51,020
which is the bouquet, uh, to the heart, if you will. Um, language allows you to open a human

1115
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:59,960
being up. Understanding does, um, if you have to tantalize or poetry or prose that, that is

1116
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:06,779
hits a nerve, uh, is the essence. But like I said, is the example I said is you got a guy

1117
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:13,399
suffering a practice. His body language is an aberration. And then you take them off to the

1118
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:18,659
side and your arms around me and say, Hey man, what gives? And he said, Hey, I had a really bad

1119
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:25,800
day. And he said, Hey, you know, Graham, I want you to know that that very same thing happened

1120
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:32,159
to me. There's going to be an explosion within that young man. If you're authentic and you're

1121
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:41,000
truthful about that shared experience, well, the language of connecting and triggering and igniting

1122
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,380
people so that they can have a good time. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

1123
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:51,739
they want to talk to you again. That's it's everything. So the study of vernacular metaphors,

1124
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:59,060
you gotta be a great storyteller. And we're none of us are when we start out, but example given

1125
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,739
Brian Gorgian, you know, I wanted to know when they won the Rose gold, the game before what

1126
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:11,520
happened to Mills Mills goes in there with Joe Ingalls and Brian Gorgian walks in and they are,

1127
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,380
I mean, they had been fourth.

1128
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:19,579
Two times over. And now it looks like they're going to be forth again. Here comes Brian through

1129
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:26,100
the doors, you know, and everybody is hang dog. It's dark in the locker room. All right. And then

1130
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:35,020
here he comes. Hey, get your head up. We just almost beat the United States of America. We

1131
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,220
will revel in that later. And, you know, Joe Ingalls was looking at him. Have you lost your

1132
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,979
mind? And he goes, no, man, that is a staging.

1133
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:49,279
And he looks right at Mills and he says, you will lead us to the promised land. All right. I feel

1134
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:56,220
that you percolated against the America, you know, USA dudes, we're going to do something. Nobody has

1135
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:03,399
ever done in the history of basketball for Australia. The flag is high. And this is an

1136
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:09,399
American. This is not somebody that was born in Australia, but he loves Australia like it's his

1137
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:13,380
own. And so he hits a nerve and Mills.

1138
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,600
Does something that nobody else has done in the history of the Olympics. I don't care if he's

1139
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:26,260
white, he's brown, he's, you know, he's, he's purple. He gets 42 points and they broke the

1140
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:33,859
sound barrier. And in the history of the books, when Mills and Patty's dead and Joe's dead,

1141
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:41,220
God forbid, and Brian's gone, somebody is going to have to read about that team and the coaching

1142
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,119
staff that was the first.

1143
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:52,300
Of all time for Australian basketball. And so my point is that inspiration, uh, didn't know if you

1144
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,539
were going to win, but put it on the line with his players, got their heads up. You saw the

1145
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:06,260
performance. That's magic. And to me, that happens every day you go into a supermarket or you go down

1146
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:13,279
the street, you can tell when somebody's suffering to take five minutes, you know, and tell, you know,

1147
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:20,859
male or female and just say, Hey man, what do you got? What do you got? What's going on? And to take

1148
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:26,460
that five, 10, 15 minutes, you mean to tell me you're more important than that. But, and then

1149
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:33,600
you could lift that person and get them to another day. There's nothing better than that. And that

1150
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:40,960
rose gold, uh, the world championship to me, helping somebody else on the same level. You can

1151
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,380
have the ring. I gave my ring to my wife.

1152
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:49,340
She's responsible for the ring. So when they gave it to me and, you know, Adam Silver's there,

1153
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:53,899
and then the owner's handing you the ring, the ceremony, and we're going back to the locker room.

1154
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:59,180
I, I, well, I actually, I did it before. There's still the ceremonies going on. I just got the box

1155
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:04,159
and I said, it's yours. She couldn't get back to her seat. All the fans in there wanted to take

1156
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:09,539
pictures with the ring, all of that. Some of the other guys were pissed off because I gave my ring

1157
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:13,380
to my wife. And I said, you know, they were going, God, man, you made a mistake. You made a mistake.

1158
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:20,880
You made me look bad, you know, but my point wasn't that, that my point is get your priorities

1159
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,020
straight. You know, that's a great goal. And that's what is, but is that where we're going to

1160
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:30,779
stop? And is that who I am? No, it's a great little thing. And I want excellence and I want

1161
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:36,340
the ring like everybody else, but it's not the essence of what it's about. And that's what I'm

1162
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:41,960
saying is there's Brian Gorgian. He's my best friend in the whole world. I played for his father.

1163
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:50,500
And so I've got a great, great role model who's teaching me how to be humble and understand that

1164
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:58,619
there's much thing, you know, then, then trophies and, and giving somebody life on the day of saying,

1165
01:16:58,699 --> 01:17:04,479
Hey, you're, I, you know, that's bad. That's bad. And that's bad. But I want you to know that me

1166
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:10,100
stopping here was because of that purple dress that you've got on. Stop me. I think you look

1167
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,659
pretty good.

1168
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,739
Pretty good. And I'm going to say that straight up. All right. Second is I love your energy.

1169
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:22,500
You're here today. You've had these three devastating things happen to you, but here you

1170
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:28,880
are. And to me, that's the essence of a good day, you know, and that's what I'm saying is get base

1171
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:35,180
sense. Forget about the home runs. Language is the bouquet to the heart. That, uh, that is

1172
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,680
brilliant. And my hair stands on the back of the neck when you tell, uh, you know, gorgeous story,

1173
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,939
the great Brian Gorgian. I've had the great privilege of doing that.

1174
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,439
I mean, just sitting down with him in the podcast and, and hearing, uh, that story, uh, you know,

1175
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:50,340
come to life and seize that moment, you know, history in Australia. And as you said, through

1176
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:55,960
language and talk about a great storyteller, Brian Gorgian, uh, is world-class on that. And,

1177
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,220
um, it is a great moment.

1178
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:05,060
Oh, he's the funniest human being in the world. I don't, he is. Oh my God. Oh, and put a beer in

1179
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:11,140
him. It is like fireworks. It's fireworks. I love them. I love them. Yeah.

1180
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,319
We mentioned the collaboration that, uh, probably brought this conversation to life and clearly a

1181
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,560
passion about collaboration. We see leaders value that more than ever. I mean, how important is

1182
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,000
collaboration been for you? Uh, it's everything. And that's why the, the, the, the payback on

1183
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,720
collaboration is don't you dare, if you've had other people help you make sure that your door

1184
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:36,760
is always open and you know, the word yes, comes out of your mouth a lot. You can't always say yes,

1185
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,819
because sometimes you're just busy and those things come up, but share your information,

1186
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:47,560
without charge, be fearless and understand that if you really believe in your self-esteem and who

1187
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:54,039
you are, there are no secrets. I don't think you have to give everything away. That's not my point,

1188
01:18:54,039 --> 01:19:00,880
but my point is be generous and be open and, you know, understand that you're no big deal.

1189
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:06,180
You know, nobody's a big deal. Don't do it that way. You know, do it the other way.

1190
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:11,920
And like you said, is I, was it Rubenstein Rubenstein that you were talking about earlier?

1191
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,939
Yeah. And what he's talking about are missing chips and building those chips within, uh, young

1192
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:26,000
men in particular, there's been an, uh, you know, uh, an emasculation unintentionally of, of, uh,

1193
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,600
generations now of young men who need to be shepherded through to, like I said, is know how

1194
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:40,260
to act and do certain things. But the problem is, is that the imprint or the modeling is, is broken.

1195
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:48,739
So you, you have to go through these arduous steps in order to reclaim that soul and who that young

1196
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:53,439
man ultimately is going to be because it's worth it. It's absolutely worth it.

1197
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,699
Uh, beautifully, uh, said my, but asking these two questions of all the leaders,

1198
01:19:57,699 --> 01:20:02,079
I've had the great privilege of sitting down with like yourself, uh, who has been the greatest

1199
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:10,119
leader in your life? Uh, in my life, uh, is Ed, Ed Gorge and Brian's father. Uh, and, and, uh,

1200
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:17,720
I can't leave out my own father. My father was a high-risk surgeon, OBGYN, started his clinic

1201
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:25,520
in a log cabin and ended up being 55 doctors. Tanana Valley Clinic, it's timeless. It's still

1202
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,920
in Fairbanks, Alaska. And he was the essence of serving your community. Chief of staff,

1203
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:39,420
you go four years. He did it for 24 years. They vote you into the chair. He retired out of that

1204
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:46,239
chair with the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. If you go into Fairbanks and you, at the time,

1205
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:53,380
he was delivering almost every baby in a community of 30,000. So he gave his heart and soul to a

1206
01:20:53,380 --> 01:21:01,239
community. Then you go to Ed Gorgian and just, you know, from being a model as a father to

1207
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:06,880
how he raised his sons to coaching me at a tender age where I was very vulnerable.

1208
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,220
I would say,

1209
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:16,739
without question, those two. And then finally, you know, being with my wife, Molly, for 35 years,

1210
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:25,399
you know, you have to be lucky. But I mean, so she, as a leader of our family and the way she's

1211
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:28,760
done things to keep everything together, a full credit to her as well.

1212
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:34,520
Well said again. I love, as you said, the fortune to have great leaders in your life. And you went

1213
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,079
straight to it. There was no hesitation. And yeah, fascinating to hear that.

1214
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:44,279
In the spirit of collaboration and clear, that's a huge part of who you are already. And you're

1215
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,880
connecting with extraordinary leaders around the world, as we mentioned, and our passion for

1216
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,659
relief. You could collaborate with anyone in the world, Mike, in any of your areas of passion. Is

1217
01:21:51,659 --> 01:22:00,239
there someone that springs to mind? Oh, in a global way, John Wooden was in my life as a young

1218
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:08,500
man. And I hung on to his coattails and just kept learning from Coach Wooden. Pete Newell, who I had

1219
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,260
mentioned,

1220
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:20,220
it is unbelievable. George Carl, I worked for him, and he was phenomenal. Obviously, I mentioned

1221
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:28,039
Ed Gorgian. But if you want to talk about people of fame, those three, George Carl, Hall of Fame,

1222
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:35,840
Pete Newell, Hall of Fame, and Brian Gorgian. Again, he's a Hall of Famer in Australia.

1223
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,399
Everything that award that they have over there for the highest,

1224
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:48,279
uh, awards that they give, Brian's in that, that, that stratosphere. Um, and then I could go on and

1225
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:54,640
on because I have the underpinnings of moving out once a week. Matt LaFleur, I mean, he's a young

1226
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:00,920
coach in the NFL, and I seize the opportunity to go to his practice and shadow him. We're building

1227
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:09,399
a relationship. Uh, so, I mean, I, I could go probably at least 30 minutes a week. I could go

1228
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:18,420
30 minutes and give you a pyramid of, of, of, uh, people, uh, within, uh, David Wheaton, you know,

1229
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:24,939
uh, what he introduced me to all these people in Australia and rules footy. And so Eddie Jones,

1230
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,579
I was up at the, you know, Canberra and I met Eddie Jones. He talked to the national team for,

1231
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:35,579
and I was helping the national team with Brian. And so I sat in on him. So when we see each other

1232
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:38,859
on the, the zoom meeting with the world symposium,

1233
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,960
it's like old home week, you know, and Hey, Eddie, how you doing? Hey, Mike, how you doing?

1234
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:52,300
And so my point is Eddie Jones is very, very, very special. Charlie Walsh, you know, the greatest

1235
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,699
cycling coach that Australia has ever had. Somebody wants to argue that that's okay. Cause I don't

1236
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:02,340
know it like that. I just know that he was phenomenal with the Olympic team, Bill Nelson,

1237
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:08,439
who was the assistant coach with the national swimming team out of Newcastle. And I mean,

1238
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:09,300
I was all over.

1239
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:20,100
You know, anybody that, that, that had something I was, was, was on it. Um, so yeah, I mean, um,

1240
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,899
you know, Pat Riley, um, for five years, I watched him coach cause they used our gym at Loyola

1241
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:31,659
Marymount. So I was the caretaker of the key that let them in for their practices. And I didn't know

1242
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:39,060
really who he was. He was the announcer before he became the head coach. And so I just sat in there

1243
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,760
and had a little yellow pad and made notes, you know, on stuff. And I knew magic Johnson.

1244
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:52,560
So, I mean, if I go into these places, it's like a bunch of capillaries. I've, you know,

1245
01:24:52,560 --> 01:25:00,340
I'm a wanderer in terms of knowledge and, uh, you know, things, you know, I, I think every sport

1246
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:08,819
women's volleyball, I can tell you that I used some netball routines on hand-eye coordination and,

1247
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:09,399
and pivot.

1248
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:15,600
It's netball teachers. And, and in particular, the women, that's why they have such a high rate

1249
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,880
of anterior cruciate tears is because of the jump stops and netball. But that's another story,

1250
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:29,020
but Jan Sterling, the best female coach in Australia that I ever, ever saw. And then I

1251
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:36,100
would put her in the top five male coaches for sure in Australia and her adroitness,

1252
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,100
the way she did what she did when she was in Adelaide.

1253
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,560
Speaker 2

1254
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:47,340
phenomenal. And so as you see, I feel terrible by leaving out another name. I can just go,

1255
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,760
I Graham Korn's was so good to me.

1256
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,319
And I did go to a crow's practice and I watched him do what he did. And he has anybody who knows

1257
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:01,319
Graham corn's knows that he is really good with people. I mean, he makes you feel good when he

1258
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:07,920
walks away from a conversation. Cause he's, he's upbeat. It's really hard for Graham corn's to be

1259
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,399
negative. You know, he's an,

1260
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:17,239
upbeat human being in the way that he does what he does but you know so my point is is that

1261
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:23,239
everybody has a little bit to offer and my guy i think it's probably in some ways uh the my favorite

1262
01:26:23,239 --> 01:26:27,739
answer and i've heard that from for many people but you can just see as a life of uh collecting

1263
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:34,159
knowledge and engaging with people you know an australian netball coach to uh you know the the
