00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,199
I hope you enjoyed this chat with Mike Dunlap,

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,679
one of the most respected coaches in the world,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,300
revered for his ability to get the most out of people.

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,339
I found myself writing notes all the way through it

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:19,260
from the brilliance of the Miracle Morning

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,660
and his passion for daily routines,

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,980
his clarity on what makes Michael Jordan the greatest of all time,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,699
having been the senior coach of the team that Michael Jordan owns,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,240
to his respect and empathy for everyone in his environment.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
It's full of gold, full of wisdom,

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,119
and came across Mike through the work that we are doing

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,380
at Alita, a business founded with my great friend Matt Waterwitz

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,000
over seven years ago.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,960
Mike, part of our signature program, Alita Connect,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,420
where we connect great leaders around the world,

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,380
and Mike is one of the brilliant examples of it.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,719
He collaborates on a monthly basis with John Alawisi,

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,439
Craig McRae from the Magpies,

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,119
Andrew McDonald from Australian Cricket,

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,179
Anthony Seabold, who's got an incredible reputation

21
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,299
in the world of rugby,

22
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,260
and also on a global scale,

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,579
Mike's joined one of the Alita Connect programs we have

24
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,200
with Mikel Arteta from Arsenal,

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,500
Matt LeFleur, who you'll hear him talk about,

26
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,659
the coach of the Green Bay Packers in this conversation,

27
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,799
and the relationship that they're building.

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,659
George Carl is a mentor of his,

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,579
and Eddie Jones from English Rugby

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,060
has also been a guest on this podcast.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,219
We love the idea of leaders getting together to collaborate.

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,780
You don't have to be a global leader

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,319
to join one of our signature programs, Alita Connect.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,299
In fact, our passion is connecting people

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,980
from small business,

36
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,400
and the arts, and different areas.

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,739
And if you're interested in doing it,

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,879
Up next, a legend in the world of elite coaching,

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,560
Mike Dunlap.

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,060
Mike Dunlap is the current assistant coach

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,500
of the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA,

43
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,060
a team that he helped win

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,079
only their second ever NBA championship in 2021.

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,040
In 2012, Mike Dunlap joined

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
the Michael Jordan-owned Charlotte Bobcats as head coach,

47
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,479
becoming the only coach in NBA history

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,340
to triple a team's win

49
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
from the preseason.

50
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,000
The NBA Hall of Fame coach,

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,979
George Carl, has this to say about Mike.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Mike Dunlap absolutely elevates every player

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,060
and team that he comes into contact with.

54
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,280
He's our guy.

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,139
He will take you from good to great.

56
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,800
Name any top-level elite coach in the game.

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,379
The only difference between Mike and them

58
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,219
is their address.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
There is no higher level of coaching ability than his.

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,520
There is absolutely no one better.

61
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,520
Mike Dunlap, it's great to catch up with you today.

62
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,099
Thanks for your time.

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:41,180
I'll see you next time.

64
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,020
I suppose high praise from a Hall of Famer in George Carl.

65
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,080
He may have had some beers before he said that,

66
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,360
but that's okay too.

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,460
No, I mean, I've been fortunate enough

68
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,759
to have mentors in the business

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,719
that were great teachers.

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,979
And as you know, being a player,

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,180
a former player,

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,620
that the ability to teach is everything.

73
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,199
And then the other part of that is to connect,

74
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,180
you know, the words you use to care,

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,659
for more than the performance

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,960
and get that across to your players is everything.

77
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,139
You talk about that care and connect.

78
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,060
You've had success everywhere you've gone, Mike.

79
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,759
And we always hear the term, you know,

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,580
success leaves clues.

81
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,560
And I'm not surprised you started there.

82
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,319
You know, for us, it feels like coaches

83
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,520
are now very much about the whole athlete.

84
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,840
What's been your success to being a consistently great coach?

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,960
I would say you're only as good as the talent that you have.

86
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
And in the journey,

87
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,800
many of the places that I haven't had success,

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,180
all I have to do is run to the nearest mirror.

89
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,300
And I think that if you're asking accountability

90
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,819
of your team and players,

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,439
my point is, is that the sport will drive you

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,319
if you're open to it, to humility.

93
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Example given, best on ground,

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,379
he could be that week and get the medal.

95
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,740
And then the next week he could,

96
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,180
uh,

97
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,120
tear his anterior cruciate.

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,379
So I just think that the, the trail of success is,

99
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,019
is, uh, laden with touchstones of humility,

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,160
sincerity, and being open to the fact that players make coaches,

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,579
coaches don't make players.

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,220
Yeah.

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,839
I love the, uh, the fact that you go to humility,

104
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,439
Mike, over, over the time.

105
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,339
And, uh, yeah, that is incredible humility because we also know,

106
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,600
you know, that, uh, that elite coaches have consistency in,

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,839
in, in success, but you, you bring it back to, you know,

108
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,439
that you're going to get humility in professional sport,

109
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,740
whether you like it or not.

110
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,180
And, and accepting that,

111
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,899
is that sort of part of the process as well?

112
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,000
I think so.

113
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,899
The thing that blocks learning is ego and what feeds ego is a paradox.

114
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,139
You have success and then the blinders start to come up.

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,860
And I think it's really important that, you know,

116
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,879
daily that routine getting up early,

117
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,319
working,

118
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,939
hard regardless of the success you've had,

119
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,360
and then attributing,

120
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,639
uh, that success to others and understanding that it's true.

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,220
Uh, and really believing that I think what gets in the way is,

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,860
you know,

123
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,019
all the back slapping and the high praise,

124
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,360
um, is something that you have to move through.

125
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,579
I don't think you have to fear it,

126
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,220
but I think you have to have a system to process it and move it away from

127
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,439
yourself because hunger is,

128
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,139
uh, really interesting conundrum.

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,019
And so in order to continue to have that appetite as you go on,

130
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,339
you've got a vault,

131
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,439
the success that you've had,

132
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,579
um,

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,100
and then go on and just stay thirsty for the cutting edge

134
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,639
because the game changes a generationally,

135
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,959
the parenting is different.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So the players that you're getting still want a clarity

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,439
competition,

138
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,399
uh, but they want it straight.

139
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,120
And so again,

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,939
I think that you have to be very,

141
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,639
very careful with success.

142
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,420
And you might find some of these questions,

143
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:21,779
uh,

144
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,079
John,

145
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,000
I think you're gonna deflect a lot of them through humility,

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,560
but I love this set about you.

147
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,860
One of your former players had this to say,

148
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,420
coach Dunlop came and built upon what my father had already done in my life.

149
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,680
He ushered a lot of us into adulthood with his values of hard work and

150
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,980
commitment and honesty,

151
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,420
the things he has proceeded to,

152
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,180
and still does the abilities and these principles he lives by still today.

153
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,720
It feels like a beautiful thing for a former player to say about you.

154
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,680
Can you expand a bit,

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:49,939
Mike,

156
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,100
on,

157
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,060
on those values that those that come under your leadership talk about?

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,639
Well,

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,560
regardless of,

160
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,480
of your values,

161
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I think that the seven habits of highly successful people book written by Covey,

162
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:04,500
um,

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,379
he,

164
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:10,139
he talks about values are one thing and everybody has,

165
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,399
maybe,

166
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,899
maybe different values,

167
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,759
but you just have to have them.

168
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,879
And I thought that the end part of that statement was quite powerful is that,

169
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,360
um,

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,639
they transition you,

171
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,620
whether that's work hard,

172
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,639
uh,

173
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,860
give credit where credit is due,

174
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,199
uh,

175
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,339
move with great sincerity,

176
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:32,360
uh,

177
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:40,279
and understand that life is to be an enjoyed all of those transitional points as a coach or teacher lead you to

178
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,879
trust.

179
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,220
Because if you're not competent,

180
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,439
the surgeon can be a derelict,

181
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,199
he can be an alcoholic 22 hours a day.

182
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,420
But the fact of the matter is when he's sober for those two hours and your best surgeon in the world,

183
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,060
people really don't care about the periphery.

184
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:56,779
You know,

185
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,180
they're not going to delve in mightily to your values.

186
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,519
They just want to know that you know your job and can do your job.

187
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,420
Yes,

188
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,819
it's more expansive than that,

189
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,120
but the most important thing to get,

190
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,699
to cross to your players and to your staff is that you know your trade,

191
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,720
you know your craft,

192
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,319
you know how players learn because you know the five laws of learning and can you spit those out?

193
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,240
Can you give examples of what they mean?

194
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,879
And can you speak in metaphors and similes to paint a picture because that's what players want.

195
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,779
And a bottom line is that what drives most players is competition.

196
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,179
They want to know who won,

197
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,019
who lost.

198
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,879
There's a book out a long time ago,

199
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,120
written,

200
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,940
by a guy named Novak called the joy of sport.

201
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,720
And he said that all these seven year olds got in a sandbox.

202
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,679
He was observing,

203
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,139
he was doing his dissertation and he said,

204
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,100
before you knew it,

205
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,519
the kids designed their own game and rules.

206
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,580
In other words,

207
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,080
people like rules.

208
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,299
They want to know who won and who lost.

209
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:08,139
And so a coach's job is to connect and intrinsically get people tap into that competitive warrior like person and say,

210
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:08,600
okay,

211
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,460
here we go.

212
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,440
Here's a way of getting about it.

213
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,899
And here's how you get the scalp,

214
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,820
so to speak.

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,600
And from my standpoint,

216
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,340
you have once you get that in a player,

217
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,779
then you can bring them back to why and manners are important.

218
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,080
Why opening a door for a young lady is,

219
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,500
is timeless.

220
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:35,080
Why kindness is something that will make you more than just a competitor and a player,

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,159
because those things last a lifetime.

222
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,440
They stay in the soul,

223
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,440
if you will,

224
00:09:39,519 --> 00:10:02,500
when you're taking your prowess at 30 or 28 or 32 and all that winning and you go to a halfway house or you go to people who have less than you do and you give away your gifts to them to give them something special on the day because that may be their best day,

225
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,679
given the fact that they're on an oxygen machine.

226
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,039
Yeah,

227
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,940
a bit preachy.

228
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,740
But the fact of the matter is,

229
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,840
is that I don't care where you go.

230
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,820
You'll find that very successful people typically are very kind hearted.

231
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,740
And really,

232
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,360
when you want to be altruistic,

233
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
you want to give all those gifts away.

234
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,799
So much gold there,

235
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,179
Mike,

236
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,860
in in your words,

237
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,299
and I'm picking up and writing notes as as you're talking.

238
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,100
And the Stephen Covey book,

239
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,440
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,

240
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,220
worth a read if you if you haven't.

241
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,200
And and and the joy of sport as well as it is a great,

242
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:54,779
and I love that you don't separate kind heartedness and being a good person from high performance and you make that link that that's there and also going back to what you said before about you touched on having good habits and people with good routines.

243
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,320
Can you talk about some of those habits?

244
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,740
Because I think that it clearly applies to your world of professional sport,

245
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,159
but also success in life.

246
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,600
Why are those habits so important?

247
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:03,220
Well,

248
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,659
again,

249
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,139
credit given to a having great English,

250
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:11,200
English teachers from grade school on up.

251
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,820
And so at some point in time,

252
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,980
I made a decision to be an English major.

253
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,200
There is a book out small book called The Miracle Morning,

254
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,340
and there's an aphorism and an acronym,

255
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,139
if you will,

256
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,460
called Savers.

257
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,460
And in the morning,

258
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,179
if you get up early of solitude and as you know,

259
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,539
Mr.

260
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,960
Rogers said is back in the day is we have a

261
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,100
noisy world.

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,620
And as the medium of,

263
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,139
of,

264
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,460
of texting and,

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,139
and,

266
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,860
and the computer and all these things came into play for this

267
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,700
generation.

268
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,179
The point is,

269
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,100
is that all this noise is taking you away from reflection and

270
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,080
thinking the value of thinking is one of those habits.

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,460
Okay.

272
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,720
Well,

273
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,879
how do I move myself into a habit of sitting early in

274
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,899
the morning before anybody gets up and using the an acronym and

275
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,519
and savers is simple.

276
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,740
It's S is for silence means that you're going to meditate.

277
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,700
A is for affirmations.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
And that could be,

279
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,279
you know,

280
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,879
talk positive,

281
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,039
think positive and act positive and drill that into your head.

282
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,059
V is for visualization,

283
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,580
create your own picture on the act of kindness or opening a

284
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,519
door or doing things.

285
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,919
But you have to have your own picture in order to enact

286
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,279
that.

287
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,659
And then you go to E,

288
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:37,799
E,

289
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,519
E exercise.

290
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

291
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,259
I only have 10 minutes,

292
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,740
pop down and do some pushups in the say 60 minutes where

293
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,100
you're away from everybody.

294
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,399
If that's the minimum that you've,

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,379
that's all you've got to dedicate to it.

296
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,340
Take a bite of the apple and go on.

297
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,080
All right.

298
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,039
Then from there,

299
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,940
you go to,

300
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:54,899
you know,

301
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,659
S A V E R read.

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,460
All right.

303
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,399
So you want to read every day.

304
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,980
That could be the New York or that could be over here.

305
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
The Atlantic.

306
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,639
Okay.

307
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,279
That's kind of esoteric.

308
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:07,740
All right.

309
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,799
Read sports illustrated read off of,

310
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,700
you know,

311
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,299
something that you get that leads you to an article on Twitter,

312
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,139
you know,

313
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,080
go to Instagram and somebody suggests something.

314
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,799
And it can be in a myriad of different forms.

315
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,899
And then finally,

316
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,080
the last S is journaling or scribing.

317
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,179
So what I've done is I've taken it through an acronym and then each

318
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,820
day I'll show you my notebook.

319
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,399
I wrote down what you had said to me,

320
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,759
and I'm only looking,

321
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,759
I'm only looking for the eyes of the fish.

322
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,399
You said success leaves clues.

323
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,399
Okay.

324
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
So I'm,

325
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,399
I'm stealing from you.

326
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,399
You,

327
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,399
you know,

328
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,399
I'll give what I've got,

329
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,399
but the humility and the connection of validation of another human being,

330
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,879
all you have to do is write something down that they talk about.

331
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,240
When a child has been abused,

332
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,879
you never go directly at the child.

333
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,559
When somebody has a hard time or they've lost a tough game,

334
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,559
you go to a common,

335
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,320
an object as opposed,

336
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
it could be a truck in the sandbox.

337
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,039
It could be a teddy bear or whatever,

338
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,120
but you use another medium to get to what you want eventually.

339
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,919
And that's a methodology.

340
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,080
And so I bring myself back to some habits there.

341
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,399
Personally,

342
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,960
I like to meditate second.

343
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
I like to do affirmations.

344
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
I like to visualize.

345
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,799
I like to exercise.

346
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,320
I love it.

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,399
As a matter of fact,

348
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,440
read,

349
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,879
I love,

350
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,159
love,

351
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,120
love to read.

352
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,440
And then,

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,000
finally,

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,039
I keep journals.

355
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,559
I keep a personal journal.

356
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,879
I keep a log like everybody does on,

357
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,679
you know,

358
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,039
what my day looks like,

359
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,320
what the week looks like,

360
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,679
what the month looks like,

361
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,320
et cetera.

362
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,159
Most successful people do that.

363
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,960
What do you do?

364
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,000
You know,

365
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,519
and then I keep another one where I just,

366
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,399
there are ideas.

367
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,720
You give me something and I'll transition it from success leaves clue to just a

368
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,279
pure book of what I would call ideas or a book.

369
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,759
I like writing poetry.

370
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
So a little bit,

371
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,919
weird little bit different,

372
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,759
but that's my life.

373
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,840
And so my point is,

374
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,879
is that I've given you an,

375
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,480
an acronym of some great habits in there.

376
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:17,919
And you say,

377
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,080
Hey,

378
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
that sounds overwhelming to me.

379
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,200
Well then do two of the savers,

380
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,919
because if I stay in your brain,

381
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,240
you say,

382
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,440
Hey,

383
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,559
I remember this dude on the podcast mentioned about the miracle morning.

384
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,799
And then he talked about this an acronym of savers.

385
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,159
And now I go right to a routine,

386
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,039
that I personally don't always accomplish,

387
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,360
but I I I'm picking off at least three or four of them per day.

388
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,559
I like to get all of them,

389
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,120
but I don't honestly.

390
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,799
And then you go from there,

391
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,960
you build from there.

392
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,039
And before you know it,

393
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
before you start your day,

394
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,759
you've,

395
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,559
you've already had some major base hits there.

396
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,919
So that's what I do.

397
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,799
I love,

398
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,000
you know,

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
the miracle morning and I love the,

400
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,120
uh,

401
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
the acronym and what,

402
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
and what it stands for.

403
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,559
And I,

404
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,440
I really relate to it too,

405
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,759
Mike,

406
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:06,879
in,

407
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,919
in lots of ways.

408
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,120
Uh,

409
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:08,759
uh,

410
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,200
I want to delve into a bit of it straight away.

411
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,759
If that's can,

412
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm in meditation.

413
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,120
Mindfulness now,

414
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,639
Mike is,

415
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,720
is really a much more known term and something that athletes consistently do.

416
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,399
I feel really lucky to have found that 25 years ago in the world of AFL

417
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,720
football,

418
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
which is quite where rare in the Western suburbs of Melbourne back in that time,

419
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,919
but the habit forming.

420
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,799
And as you said,

421
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:30,960
you know,

422
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,799
you think of the alternative and a lot of kids start the day.

423
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,159
First thing you're on the smartphone,

424
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:35,559
you,

425
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:35,960
you know,

426
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,200
you're overwhelmed,

427
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,399
you know,

428
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
overwhelmed with all of this material.

429
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,000
And that's the first thing that you do that,

430
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,360
you know,

431
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,600
and to not exercise,

432
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,039
to not give you your mind that think time or to not read for,

433
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:46,919
for better learning.

434
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,720
So it's so much wisdom in,

435
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,039
uh,

436
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,639
in what you say,

437
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:49,799
what,

438
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,679
what type of meditation do you,

439
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,480
do you prefer?

440
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,759
Mike,

441
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,759
do you mix it up or,

442
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,279
Hey,

443
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:55,919
um,

444
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,679
you know,

445
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,519
there are a couple of favorites,

446
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,799
but what's awesome on the topic of the cell phone and then the meditation is,

447
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,720
is that with today's youth,

448
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,640
the cell phone is such an attribute,

449
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,440
but it's gotta have a discipline to it.

450
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,480
So we have a no phone zone at certain times during the day.

451
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,839
It could be the dinner table or it could be the coach says,

452
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,480
Hey,

453
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,640
you know,

454
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,680
put a leash on that and put it in your bag and then see it post game.

455
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,359
But whatever the philosophy is of that building or that adult,

456
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,319
but the main point about the cell phone is it's not the enemy,

457
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,519
but like anything,

458
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,400
it is a secondary to the importance of who you are,

459
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,440
how you act and what you do.

460
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,720
And if you let the phone,

461
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,079
it will end up controlling you versus you controlling it.

462
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,119
And that's why I say you've got to put a leash on it.

463
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,720
You got,

464
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,200
you got to get it in its proper place.

465
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,920
And if you start with young adults or anybody else and say,

466
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,279
Hey,

467
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,279
it's the enemy.

468
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:00,920
And then you,

469
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,359
then you sound like you're 9,000 years old.

470
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,240
And so I think,

471
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,880
I think a better way to approach.

472
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,279
Young adults and footy players and whomever is,

473
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:11,759
Hey man,

474
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,640
isn't it great.

475
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,079
Look what it does.

476
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,640
But then you have to have an etiquette to the phone,

477
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,200
the phone.

478
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,480
I mean,

479
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,720
it's ridiculous at restaurants when you go in and you know,

480
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,480
the heads down and nobody's conversing and conversation takes a secondary

481
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,359
interactions,

482
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,759
relationships,

483
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,359
all of that.

484
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:29,720
It's a,

485
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,519
it's a mechanism for people to hide,

486
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,200
to shield themselves,

487
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,880
to not communicate.

488
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
And I,

489
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
and I always just tell 10 people,

490
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
if you're in a room,

491
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,359
if you understand that about the phone,

492
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,440
then you're going to understand that you can get an edge every day.

493
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,759
If you know how to use the phone to your benefit,

494
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,319
but the phone can be a really negative thing.

495
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,799
Okay.

496
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,480
How is it a positive thing to meditation is there's over seven or 800.

497
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,519
All you have to do is Google and go,

498
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,079
I want a 10 minute meditation.

499
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,160
I want a 20 minute.

500
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,640
Meditation or a longer meditation.

501
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,200
And you can go potpourri and it just comes up.

502
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,119
You scroll and you pick what you want.

503
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:12,799
Personally.

504
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,240
I like one that's 18 minutes and it's waves.

505
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,240
And it's an Australian who takes you through and get you to your

506
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
subconscious.

507
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
And he goes through four or five markers.

508
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,160
And I would say I've listened to it a thousand times already.

509
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
In other words,

510
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
it fits me.

511
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,799
And I'm not a guy who has to look at it and say,

512
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,799
this is what I need.

513
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,799
This is what I need.

514
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,720
This is what I need.

515
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,799
This is what I need.

516
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,799
This is what I need.

517
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,799
This is what I need.

518
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,799
This is what I need.

519
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,799
I'm not a guy who has to look over the fence.

520
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,799
If you talk to any monk or anybody who talks about the fly wheel or the

521
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,799
simplicity of the hedgehog, learn how to do one thing.

522
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,799
Great.

523
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,039
Jim Collins, good to great, et cetera.

524
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,039
He also wrote built to last a dynamic speaker around the world.

525
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,799
But the bottom line is,

526
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,799
is that what you're trying to do is not do a thousand things.

527
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,799
Well, you're trying to do one thing.

528
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,279
Extremely well find your passion.

529
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,319
And then just keep hitting a button.

530
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:04,680
Okay.

531
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,559
button and the next thing you know, people are giving you money. It's ridiculous. But to have

532
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:16,400
the discipline to go to the same meditation and to drill down on it and find iterations

533
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,920
and different avenues of what that man is saying to you or what you can expound upon

534
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,779
within your own imagination is timeless and unbelievable. Now I went existential on most

535
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:36,740
of your audience. I'll bring myself back. But you've got 700 or 800 of those on Google at least

536
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:45,220
that will take you to another 700 if you're really adventurous and want to find a meditation.

537
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,779
But just go to Google and just type in meditation and it'll give you any kind, standing on your head,

538
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:59,619
laying down, swimming. I mean, it's ridiculous. So anyway, mine's an 18 minute shot. I find that

539
00:20:59,619 --> 00:20:59,759
that's a success.

540
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:06,019
fits my day. And, uh, you know, you know, I'm kind of like this, got it done. I feel good about

541
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,740
that part, but there's other things to do. Yeah. I was taught a mantra based transcendental

542
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,180
meditation, which has stayed with me, but, but you're right. And I love you. I love your language

543
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,460
there around putting the leash on the phone. And as a father of four, I think it's the parenting

544
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,200
conversation we have all the time around, you know, it's the number one driver, but I think

545
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,420
you're right when you demonize it, you're underestimated. I love how the kids connect.

546
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,519
I love how they can get together so much simpler than we grew up, but having some boundaries. And

547
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,160
so the Milwaukee Bucks, you left times where the players will say, Hey, it's dinner time or meal

548
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,119
time. Put your phones in your bag. You guys put some leash around that even at NBA level.

549
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,380
Yes. I think everything is about understanding that freedom is responsibility and responsibility

550
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,880
is freedom. You know, when, when over in the United States, they have graduation talks all

551
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,200
the time. And there's a guy that, that is a brilliant writer called

552
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,400
David.

553
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,059
Brooks. He wrote the second mountain, but anyway, he talks about all these fancy people,

554
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,299
whether it's Bill Gates, or it could be, you know, this guy or this woman who has a resume

555
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,359
that weighs not, you know, uh, weighs it's, it's, it's hefty and they're brilliant people and all

556
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:22,799
that, but they get up there and they tell an audience of 1000 students that are 21 years old,

557
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,539
that are, you know, literally crapping their pants, wondering what the heck they're going to

558
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,400
do with their lives.

559
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,079
And they're saying, Hey, you be you find your passion. Well, what they're doing is they're

560
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,819
just throwing gasoline on the fire. They're not giving them anything that's credible to,

561
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,319
Hey, tell me what to do in the next six months. They don't want to know what to do with the rest

562
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:49,140
of their life. They just want to not be scared because I know I was sitting in that chair and

563
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,380
I talked to my buddies and we were all sitting there having a beer after graduation. I have no

564
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,799
idea what I'm going to do. And my, my, my, my, my, my point is that it's, it's, it's really important

565
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:09,440
that each day that we connect with simple things and understand that the complex, if you're a good

566
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:17,480
teacher, a good leader is to boil it down and hand the mouth, help people understand that,

567
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,960
you know, you being you and freedom has a responsibility attached to it.

568
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:33,740
And the more you can teach a younger person, my father made me, and we had five of us,

569
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,759
we had to start buying our clothes in the sixth grade. If we needed a little help here or there,

570
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,299
yeah, but you are, and it was custom in our home to start buying our clothes in the sixth grade.

571
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,059
Well, that meant that you had to paint finishes. You had to cut lawn. You had to have a job.

572
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
That was just a given in today's age. I don't care if it's the AFL,

573
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,380
and now you've got 18 to 20, 22 year olds. You say, raise your hand if you've had a job

574
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,700
and you would be stunned by the fact that the majority of the room, they've never worked a

575
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,299
job or paid taxes or done whatever. So it just means that's not necessarily the worst thing in

576
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:17,220
the world. It's what you're inheriting are a lot of people that have not taken traditional steps

577
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,859
to the word responsibility. And when you have a human being that says, give me, give me, give me

578
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,299
it doesn't make them awful. What it means is somebody didn't teach them that.

579
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,579
And so instead of indictment judgment, you say, okay, this is what I've got. And this is where

580
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:43,160
we've got to go. And anybody can, you know, take somebody that's gifted. That's been disciplined

581
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,319
by great parents, but can you take somebody that's talented, that's lazy or hasn't been

582
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,359
taught properly or has an abusive father and lead them to the right path?

583
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:01,759
To a higher plateau where they say, Hey, that's not proper to slap a woman. No, we don't do that.

584
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:07,900
We never do that. And here's why, you know, and then you go down that road, but their model and

585
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,019
what they saw in the home was opposite that. Well, you're not going to fix that young man in a day

586
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:20,240
or a week. You have to understand it's going to take a process. Well, it's the same thing as the

587
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,160
phone or it's the same thing as freedom. Freedom is a,

588
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:33,759
arduous process that is not a give me thing. It is actually a type, well, I've got to do A to B to C

589
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,720
and then the door of freedom opens up. Yeah. Brilliantly said, Mike. I love

590
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:46,140
listening to the way you eloquently describe the pathway to success. And as you said,

591
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,140
you can sit there in front of someone who's, you know, as you said, got a hefty resume.

592
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,700
And I remember sitting there, how is it even possible to even look at that? But, you know,

593
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,359
when you break it down, you've got to be able to say, well, I've got a hefty resume.

594
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,680
I go back to the miracle morning. If you start your day with some reflection and some mindfulness

595
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,559
and some exercise and some affirmation and some visualization and some journaling, you're probably

596
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,819
going to be on the path to finding that yourself. And so, yeah, incredibly brilliant the way that

597
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,380
you've summed that up. I want to change tack, Mike. There's so much to talk to you about and

598
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,720
go to a moment in your life where the greatest athlete on the planet, maybe the greatest athlete

599
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,700
in history, Michael Jordan, owns his own NBA team. He's the majority shareholder of Charlotte

600
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,660
Bobcats, now the Charlotte Hornets. Can you tell us about that phone call, that experience when you

601
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,660
take the NBA senior role and clearly linked to Michael Jordan's got to be a unique experience?

602
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,819
Well, it was, I would just say, you know, working threes because people can digest threes.

603
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,299
Really, because your question begs, what's it like to be in a room with him? And, you know,

604
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,319
what makes him tick? And being in a room with them is he's really aware,

605
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,720
has a sixth sense about the dynamics of people. And he was a tremendous leader,

606
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:07,740
is a tremendous leader, and has, I would say, good humility given the accolades of being

607
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:15,579
bestowed and earning that as the greatest player in a sport. You know, there are others,

608
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:20,759
but he's definitely at the top. And some people want to argue it. That's fine.

609
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,640
But definitely, he's right up there with the top.

610
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:33,480
Two or three, and then the argument stops. But I would say that everybody that ever watched him

611
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,779
play, highly, highly competitive. And, you know, people will say, okay, he's competitive,

612
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,619
but what does that mean? He's thorough. When he's trying to be a great owner, whether he's trying to

613
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:53,279
win a golf game or what he did with basketball is, is that he has a flame within him that if he walks

614
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:01,819
into a room, he has presence. And it's about competing. I mean, he would show up to anything.

615
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,640
And ultimately, he's going to turn it into competition. He can't help himself.

616
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:13,819
And that's, he's a warrior competitor. And he's going to turn a party into competition. It could

617
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:22,960
be quarters, it could be a conversation. But so that stands out. You know, so I would say presence,

618
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:31,799
competitor, and then three, you know, three is, which he tries to keep veiled, but he's service

619
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:40,059
related. He gives a ton of money that's not tagged, Michael Jordan money, to a lot of

620
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:49,039
African American colleges in America, not just one. He's got $100 million tagged over the next

621
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,619
decade to go to educational programs and scholarship programs.

622
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:00,400
My point is, is that there's a degree of humility. And he doesn't want that to boomerang

623
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,460
back and look at me, look what I'm doing. But the big point there on point number three is he's

624
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:13,059
community related. And he wants to impact and he's impacted Charlotte, you know, not only with

625
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:19,779
the employment of more than 1000 people in his building and what the Hornets mean to the community.

626
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,480
But he also takes his stack of money,

627
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:31,220
and gives it away quietly, quietly. So those are the three things that in presence of MJ that

628
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:38,240
were noticeable to me, there's more and more and more of stories and this, that and the other thing,

629
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,220
but to highlight that is presence, competitor, and community related.

630
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,259
So Mike, to sort of reflect the documentary that he produced was, you know, again, everything he

631
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,480
does becomes, you know, bigger than...

632
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,660
Than anything previously. And that, you know, without understanding the Netflix numbers is a

633
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,599
global phenomenon. And people then got a look on the inside at that last year of Michael Jordan

634
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:11,200
and him sitting down reflecting back. I mean, a remarkable thing and a time piece to have in lots

635
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,740
of ways. But I think all of us then got a sense of just the drive. And then also, perhaps that,

636
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:22,700
you know, again, the barroom conversation, you know, did he end up with great camaraderie with

637
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,279
his teammates?

638
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,720
Was that a cost of doing business to be that good? I mean, how did you reflect on looking at that? Did

639
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,180
you think, well, that's just his path to being the best of all time? Or did that come at a cost

640
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,680
in some way in your mind looking at that as well? It always comes at a cost for everybody. You know,

641
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:46,000
leadership is a lonely role and it's not for everybody. And so if you think you're going to

642
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,519
sit in that chair and, you know, be all things to all people, you're sadly mistaken and you've

643
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,480
never sat in a chair.

644
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:01,220
You know, whether you're running your own company that's a high-end company, elite, and you're wanting

645
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,180
to be the best, there's a price to be paid. He paid the price. At the moment, you know, when he was

646
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:16,500
running down the trail and he was a bull, I would say the camaraderie was contentious at times, but

647
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,140
there are other times where he went out with his team, he paid for the bills, they had a great state,

648
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:23,240
etc.

649
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:32,799
And they had a really good time. But the vapor of that was an indictment on that he was a roughneck

650
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:41,460
and that, you know, he was hard to be around at times. It's complicated, but I would say that

651
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:49,299
I'm on the side of MJ. You know, he didn't hesitate in the documentary to say, this is who I was,

652
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:53,599
this is what I did. And I thought some of the things that were said about him were,

653
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:01,400
cowardly, you know, and I'll say it to Pippen, I'll say it to BJ Armstrong or whatever. Not that

654
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,700
they shouldn't have their opinion, but, you know, fly and go see him in his living room

655
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,920
and break it down for him. You know, easy to be filmed and say that, and they wouldn't have said

656
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,339
it the same way had they been in his presence. And so my point is that I'm for him because

657
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,680
if you're going to say what you say, you're going to say it the same way.

658
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:32,460
And the way you said it, then give the rings to him. Because, you know, I think that also is that

659
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:41,799
Phil Jackson allowed and wanted him to do part of Phil Jackson's job. You know, some of the

660
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,539
admonishing and going harder and, hey, that's not good enough, should have been in Phil Jackson's

661
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,539
lap, not Jordan's. But Jordan took over and he,

662
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:01,779
you know, six championships, etc. And everybody said he was the lead dog. Well, when 10 or 20

663
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:08,779
years goes by, you got to understand that you can't have just all good. You know, there's a

664
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:14,000
trade-off. And if you want those rings and want to look at them and brag about them and that,

665
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,119
you got to understand that the lead dog did his job. Did he not? Did he not do his job?

666
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,599
Did he do his job? He did his job.

667
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,079
Better than anyone's ever done it before, Mike. And I,

668
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,680
and I thought, you know, I'm going to have to do it.

669
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,160
Very much into your cab. And I think, imagine the privilege of being a teammate. Imagine being

670
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,660
swept up on that train. It would have been brilliant. And as you said, everything comes

671
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,440
at a cost. I think I, you know, wrote that down again and I bring it back to an Australian

672
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,640
connection for me. Luke Longley was part of that. And as Australians, we got to live through the

673
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,420
Chicago Bull era and through Luke Longley and who didn't feature heavily. But I did see,

674
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,319
and a lot of people won't understand this, Michael Jordan sat down with the ABC afterwards

675
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,519
and, uh, I'm having trouble thinking of the, uh, Australian story is the, um, famous program

676
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,160
that does documentary type story. And he sat down with them. And as you said, in terms of curry and

677
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,839
said, Hey, look, you know what? If I look back, we probably did miss out on it, but we're filming

678
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,920
a documentary. You can't tell every part of it. And Luke was a big part of, uh, of the team.

679
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,159
And I'd go and play with Luke anytime again was, was the words that, that he used. So, uh, you

680
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,420
know, I think, um, I think it's a, it's a brilliant. Well, the, the great thing about Luke Longley

681
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,500
is what,

682
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,719
he was a piece of clay. And if we're talking directly about Jordan, uh, Jordan said, here's,

683
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,639
here's the road that we're going to travel, hold onto my hand and I'll take you to a place

684
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,840
that you've never been before. And Luke would admit that. And, um, so Jordan was the bright

685
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:49,260
light in the room and, you know, there's there, it's not all going to be peaches and cream.

686
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,159
And when you are a dynasty,

687
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:59,539
it is the hardest thing in the world to do. And if it were easy, everybody'd be doing it.

688
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,900
And the thing that, that, that excellence and living a 1% life means that four in the morning

689
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,860
is four in the morning. You know, I was at an ice cream shop below a hotel in the basement.

690
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,360
And there's a guy named Marinovich, who's a famous weight coach for pro athletes. He had

691
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,980
a son that played at USC and,

692
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,980
went on to play in a very controversial life for the Raiders, et cetera.

693
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:35,960
Nonetheless, the ice cream shop was a napkin that had Jordan's autograph on it

694
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,440
and said, have a great day, something along those lines.

695
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,780
And that led me down the basement corridor to the weight room,

696
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:50,840
and he said whenever Jordan came in to Anaheim, he would lift on game day here,

697
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:57,039
and the things that he did with his weight coach on game day were crazy.

698
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,119
You know, he was doing supersets, squats, lunges, and the whole thing.

699
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:11,599
And the point of that is that Jordan tortured himself to be the best of the best.

700
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,840
And when you get into that thin air,

701
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,280
it's really hard to explain to anybody who's never lived

702
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,820
the best of the best.

703
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,619
The 4 a.m. life and the 16 to 18-hour day and the pressure of the media

704
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:33,539
and holding form when you're injured, and to do that and be number one,

705
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,860
I don't care who you investigate, whether it's Steve Jobs or it's Bill Gates

706
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,960
or whatever, they all have their pimples.

707
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,719
They all have their pimples.

708
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,460
But when you look at their work day, when you look at their ability

709
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
that they see life differently.

710
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,019
And they have the discipline of free time to say, no, I'm not going to do that.

711
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,039
No, I'm not going to do that.

712
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:06,119
That, you know, time will speak for eternity on how remarkable Michael Jordan is

713
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,699
and was and will be and a standard for all time.

714
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,760
I mean, Bill Russell, same deal, standard for all time.

715
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:18,519
Donald Bradman, standard for all time.

716
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,019
Those things are hard.

717
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,500
You know, to do.

718
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,119
And as you know, you can name the best footy players that ever played the game.

719
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,320
Barry Robbins.

720
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,900
I mean, you know, there it is.

721
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,599
I mean, there are only so many greats out there and it comes at a severe price.

722
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,079
Yeah, that's why we love understanding that geniuses and all trying to.

723
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,039
And you described Jordan as the bright light in the room.

724
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,539
The bright light in the room, you're probably around in the NBA at the moment.

725
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,840
Giannis Adedokumbo, who is a two-time.

726
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:53,639
NBA MVP delivered in lots of ways.

727
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:59,320
The MVP of the final series 2021 for Milwaukee's second ever championship.

728
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:03,980
Has he got that sort of genius we just heard you talk about?

729
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,480
Is he in that sort of conversation?

730
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:13,199
Yeah, he'll move himself to, you know, in the conversation of the top five

731
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,739
in the next couple of years.

732
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:19,059
If injury doesn't visit his doorstep, everybody knock on wood.

733
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:19,800
But.

734
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,360
Yes.

735
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:23,820
I mean, if there's no question, he's 6'11".

736
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,519
He does things on the court that nobody has ever done other than maybe as an athlete.

737
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:39,260
Wilt Chamberlain was the only one in terms of stride distance is a kind of a scientific thing.

738
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:49,400
But he has things that he does both physically and mentally and spiritually that are at the highest level.

739
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:49,980
I mean.

740
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:53,679
As a competitor, he's like Jordan.

741
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,360
Physically, the ball in his hand is like a golf ball.

742
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,559
That's how big his hand is.

743
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
His arms are 7'4".

744
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,699
You know, all of that stuff.

745
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,039
So he has the physical attributes.

746
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,440
And then his free time is consumed in the weight room.

747
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,480
Consumed with shooting.

748
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,980
Practice.

749
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,980
Another session.

750
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:26,260
And then he does a mental session every day with our sports psychologist.

751
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:33,019
He's willing to pay the price to have his name eventually put up there with the greats.

752
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,139
Mike, it's a great insight.

753
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,219
We appreciate it.

754
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,699
And also a great reflection, clearly, on the culture you've got at Milwaukee.

755
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,119
You know, to keep a player of that quality.

756
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,440
He's been there for nine years.

757
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:48,380
You know, the world would be at his door enticing him elsewhere.

758
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,900
I mean, can you speak to that?

759
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:54,239
Culture, that's a significant achievement to keep him at your club for such a long time.

760
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,039
Yeah.

761
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:03,639
The Milwaukee Bucks, whether it's John Horst, our general manager, our owners, or everybody else,

762
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:11,719
our medical people, Coach Bud, Jason Kidd before him, all of that is a village, as they say,

763
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,440
that connected with him.

764
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,780
People would probably want to ask or know, well, what was the one?

765
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:24,300
Fred, that maybe made him go small market and be loyal.

766
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:34,119
And it was the fact that he was in abject poverty, sold sunglasses along with his brothers in order to give money back to his family so they could eat.

767
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:41,219
So doing that at a young age gave him a love for stability.

768
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
And he understood the underdog.

769
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,699
The small market, you have to have an ability not to want to go to New York.

770
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:54,940
Or Miami or L.A., the easy road.

771
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,679
He was raised hard.

772
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,519
You know, like I said, he had a job that taught him how to work hard and also is somewhere along the line.

773
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:10,539
His mother and his father taught him the value of loyalty.

774
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:19,579
And what he's getting back from the community and the city of Milwaukee is wherever he goes, he is loved.

775
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,019
And again, he has a set of manners on him.

776
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:31,739
He understands that, you know, he was given something by the stars and he's going to take full advantage of it.

777
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:42,960
But if you said, what's the one thing away from the physical attributes that he has is that he is an incredibly humble human being and has a set of manners on him.

778
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,619
Yes, sir.

779
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:44,199
No, sir.

780
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,840
I don't care who's talking to him.

781
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,059
And whenever he warms up at home.

782
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:49,300
I don't care who's talking to him.

783
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,019
And whenever he warms up at home.

784
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:53,539
We have ball boys that rebound for him under the basket.

785
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,920
They could be six years old.

786
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,079
They could be adults or whatever.

787
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,139
He shakes a hand.

788
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,739
He gets done with his routine.

789
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,539
And I've never seen him miss shaking a hand.

790
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:06,059
I mean, he just knows how to say thank you.

791
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,679
So that makes him very special.

792
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,820
Well, a great story to share, Mike, isn't it?

793
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:20,000
At that level, I love hearing the words humility come through a lot in the great people that you've had the privilege of being around and working with.

794
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:27,840
This podcast, Mike, was based on a partnership with one of my oldest friends, Matt Wadowitz, in a leadership business we founded called Alita.

795
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,579
And our signature program is Alita Connect.

796
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,579
And we are really passionate about collaborative groups of leaders from different backgrounds getting together.

797
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:46,920
And it was your great friend, Brian Gorgian, who's got a huge reputation in Australia for his incredible legacy with Australian basketball and sport and referred you into the world.

798
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,760
And the fact that you can hear the lifelong learning in your language.

799
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,880
You're constantly open to learning.

800
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:56,320
And you've collaborated with some of our great Australian coaches in recent times.

801
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,579
Craig McRae is doing an incredible job at Collingwood.

802
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,519
Andrew McDonald, Anthony Seabold, John Aloisi from the world of the roundball game.

803
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:07,340
Can you tell us about your passion to get together and connect with other leaders?

804
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:08,320
Yeah.

805
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:10,619
Back to Brian Gorgian.

806
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,440
If you guys, and you probably already know this.

807
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,739
But if you do your homework, take every coach that's ever coached in the history of your life.

808
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,079
Land.

809
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,699
And he's number one.

810
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm talking tennis.

811
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,539
I'm talking Charlie Walsh.

812
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,360
I'm talking Lindsey Gaze.

813
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,760
Nobody has a better win percentage or more wins than Brian Gorgian.

814
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,840
And the only reason I mention that is, is that I played for his father.

815
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:49,739
And at 21, I started going over to Australia and working in Albert Park over in a corner with some of his peers.

816
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,820
And that blossomed into working and being the head coach of the Adelaide 36ers.

817
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,099
I was fortunate enough to be there three years.

818
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,500
But my point is that, you know, I have great friends.

819
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,119
And your selection of friends is everything about who you are.

820
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:12,480
And even being with, and I don't mean that even being.

821
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,900
But with Matt, he has opened the door to the best of the best in Australia.

822
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:19,579
And young coaches that are actually.

823
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:21,139
They're actually in the theater now.

824
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:22,719
I jumped on that.

825
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,619
Brian provided that for me.

826
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:31,179
And so I want to give credit to Brian and Matt for bringing me to you, Luke.

827
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,139
So thank you.

828
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,019
But I'm just a hunter of people.

829
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,920
I don't think you have enough friends.

830
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,519
I've heard people say I have enough friends or the ones I really trust.

831
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,760
I can count on one hand.

832
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm not that guy.

833
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,119
I don't believe that.

834
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
I want to keep opening new cupboards.

835
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:50,960
I want to keep opening new cupboards to new friends.

836
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,579
Because I think there's an energy to it.

837
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:55,679
There's a warmth to it.

838
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,559
And I would tell every coach, as you age, start collecting younger and younger friends.

839
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:07,119
You know, as a coach of college, I was always working between 18 and 22, basically.

840
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:10,420
So I was infused with youth my whole life.

841
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:12,099
And so I have all.

842
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,760
And they're going to have marriages.

843
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,900
They're going to have kids.

844
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,699
And so I'm going to all these weddings and stuff.

845
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,239
You know, as.

846
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:21,199
Somebody who's now 65.

847
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:30,059
But my point is, is that Pete Newell, who was a great, great basketball coach at the same level as John Wood.

848
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,480
He's Mount Rushmore coach in terms of what he did and all that.

849
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,980
I worked his big man camp for 20 years.

850
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,099
But the one lesson he taught me is he said, young man, having lunch with them.

851
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,079
He said, the one thing I'm going to give you as a gift is this.

852
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:47,980
You listen to me.

853
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:48,760
You're going to be fine.

854
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,320
You don't.

855
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,960
You're going to auger in and become old and bitter.

856
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:54,000
Keep an open mind.

857
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:01,980
He said, when you go to a clinic or you watch somebody have a notebook, pay homage to them, ask them questions.

858
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:03,280
Never think you know it all.

859
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:09,800
And if they're telling you something you already know, write it again because it will reinforce what eventually you'll forget.

860
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:13,039
And I'm just sitting there.

861
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:17,579
And I said, you know, like I'm meeting you today for the first time.

862
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:18,579
It's another opportunity.

863
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,719
It's another opportunity to learn.

864
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:22,679
And that's the way I look at it.

865
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,179
And then the second admonition is as you get older, you are your experiences.

866
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,099
And then you always want to talk about yesterday.

867
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:37,639
And I think, again, you have to flush that stuff and codify it and put it on a bookshelf and say, I don't know anything.

868
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:42,639
Whenever I walk into a room, first thing I say to myself, I don't know anything.

869
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,679
And I always say that person and that person smarter than me.

870
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,300
And it's a really great place.

871
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:59,739
It's a really great place to start because it puts the antennas up and you're willing to listen to a seven-year-old say something that is profound, Forrest Gump-like.

872
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:08,820
Or it's somebody that is talking and you think, well, because they have never won a national championship or world championship, why bother?

873
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,059
That's ridiculous.

874
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,139
I went to a class.

875
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,360
My wife stimulated this, but in love and logic.

876
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,440
I tell coaches all the time.

877
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,900
The best class you can ever go to is never the greatest coach of all time.

878
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:29,480
It's parenting class because in love and logic, whoever is up there, it's their 1200th class.

879
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:41,019
So that means that they're teaching something in terms of concepts and they've dealt with trouble and problems for 1200 classes.

880
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,980
And so they're dealing with methodology of raising children.

881
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,380
And so I had no idea about.

882
00:47:48,440 --> 00:48:03,039
Phases of children, the fair phase, the phase where the shutout phase, daughter to mother here, it happens at this time here, it comes where the father has to enter and be there on site for two years.

883
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,139
I had no clue of any of this stuff.

884
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:14,239
But then if you understand parenting, then you're going to understand any player that comes across your radar and they don't all come across.

885
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,159
I, sir, they're going to come across troubled.

886
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,400
They're going to come across.

887
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,619
As a different learner, they're going to come across with a whole host of things where you say, I don't understand them.

888
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,260
Why won't they run hard?

889
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:32,079
And then now you go to somebody, say, oh, I see what's going on.

890
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,960
There's something that they came to the paddock with.

891
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,400
That's a problem.

892
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:39,159
So now I'm just going to start giving them a hard one.

893
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,079
And yet they have something there.

894
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:46,599
It doesn't mean I'm going to give them an out, but how about we call them the assistants take over and put my arm around it.

895
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:47,500
And I say, Hey.

896
00:48:47,500 --> 00:49:02,559
You know, Graham, what, what, what, what, what happened out there, you know, and then he says, Hey, you know, my girlfriend did this and say, Hey, we're going to get to that later and I'm going to take you to lunch.

897
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:11,340
But that's no excuse for going from A to B because you wouldn't allow that with a high risk surgeons are going to work on your son.

898
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,920
What's he going to start talking to you about the fact that his wife served him papers for a divorce.

899
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,320
So he's going to stop surgery.

900
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,139
I mean, come on.

901
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,099
And so, I mean, this is the kind of thing you have to be aware of.

902
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,539
And it all goes back to, am I a good learner?

903
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:42,780
And am I open to the fact that if you want to know how somebody operates, there's a whole nother world underneath that are called triggers where you hear them speak and you go, okay, there's something else I need to get to.

904
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,099
Hey, I noticed that you said this word over here.

905
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,139
Like, uh,

906
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:53,059
you were struggling with getting your car going, you know, whatever that was.

907
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,199
Well, what did that struggle?

908
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,780
I mean, what's that about?

909
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,460
Well, I'm behind on my bills.

910
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:58,340
You are.

911
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,860
Well, what are you doing with your money, man?

912
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,940
You got plenty of money.

913
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:04,860
And now he says, well, you know, I really liked the casino.

914
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,380
Oh, okay.

915
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:07,360
All right.

916
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:13,420
So my point is, is that there's always another investigation to be done.

917
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:17,059
And you have to be open to people.

918
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:22,059
Who will help and know more than you and almost every aspect of life.

919
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,760
And that's where you go and you ask questions and you listen, you button your mouth and let them teach you.

920
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:42,739
I love the brilliance of what you said, Mike relates clearly, you know, in sport, dealing with athletes, but in anyone who might be running a business, listen to this or anyone who's managing people is you're not forgiving the behavior of A to B, as you said, but we're going to acknowledge that and we need to work on that.

921
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,059
But let's also find out personally, because all of us have a bad day with the past.

922
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:51,320
I know all of us, you know, make a mistake at some point in whatever area of our life.

923
00:50:51,320 --> 00:51:04,000
And so, you know, it's where the, the opportunity is and, and, you know, we're coming back without the name dropping element to this, Mike, because I know the humility is, but you have opened up this world of connection and I love it.

924
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:17,119
And I do it for a reason as well, because when people, you know, your schedule at the Milwaukee Bucks doesn't lend itself, you would think to self reflect and take the time, but you're now, you know, connecting into Matt LaFleur.

925
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:22,139
As the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who's one of the most revered coaches, Mikel Arteta from Arsenal.

926
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:28,500
I know you've got another collaborative group going, George Carl, who's obviously a great mentor and friend of yours, Eddie Jones from English Rugby.

927
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:39,119
So the fact, and we, we just get as excited, Mike, as someone who is running a small business with two people in it, who wants to get together and continue that learning journey and share with others.

928
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,800
And these brilliant young female leaders that in their twenties that we're learning from who are doing things that we couldn't have even dreamed about.

929
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:53,420
And so for us, our passion is collect, connecting and collecting was probably the wrong word, but in some ways it is these groups of people who want to reflect and learn.

930
00:51:53,519 --> 00:52:05,139
And so when people like you do it, who've had success, it really does, I think, offer a window into lifelong learning, as you said, and your story about keeping an open mind, you know, really resonates.

931
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:12,800
So thank you for, for A, joining the world we love of a leader, but also your, your, your input and your knowledge has been clearly profound.

932
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
So, so thanks again, Mike.

933
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:25,960
Mike, we've been, for us, identifying what we think great leadership looks like in, in the context of, of the people we've had this great privilege of working with and, and, and spending time with like you.

934
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,139
And we think for us, there are dimensions that are really clear coming out.

935
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:34,280
The first one is self-leadership that we think most leaders have a real sense of self-leadership.

936
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,239
Does that term resonate with you?

937
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,119
Yeah.

938
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,219
I mean, accountability.

939
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:44,719
When you say self-leadership is the doorway has got to be, be an accountability.

940
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:56,579
To walking your talk cliche, but you definitely have to provide an example as, as people are digging in for a long run with you.

941
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:09,599
And it could be 25 year business could be 40 years, et cetera, is that the connector would be that you have an employee and their child goes to the hospital because they got burned or whatever.

942
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,360
There is no excuse for the leader.

943
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,280
Either.

944
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:36,599
You know, uh, using zoom FaceTime or going to the hospital to see that child, to show that kind of love, if you will, that, yeah, we have a bottom line and we want to make money, but intrinsically, if you want to connect with somebody forever, those are actions, not words.

945
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,420
And so self-leadership is about what you do, not what you say.

946
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,159
We've seen ladies, another dimension are really conscious now.

947
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:55,380
And we've heard that in your words already about how they positively impact people in their environment.

948
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,539
You just shared a story of doing that in real time.

949
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:02,800
That idea of positively impacting others on a daily basis, Mike, does that resonate as well?

950
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,199
Say that one again, please.

951
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:14,679
Positively impacting others in your environment, latest conscious of, uh, of, you know, really sophisticated about how they on a day-to-day basis have a positive impact.

952
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:16,440
Is that something you've given thought to?

953
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,320
Yeah.

954
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,139
It, the aura of being positive is validating.

955
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:39,320
In other words, it'll fizzle out extrinsically on the person, uh, if it's just happy days and you bypass their suffering, every one of your workers, every one of your players has something going on, uh, that, that isn't pleasant.

956
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:47,440
And to assume the other thing and be, you know, throwing bouquets of flowers all the time will, they will die and wilt.

957
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,880
It's imperative.

958
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,079
Then in order to be that and have great impact.

959
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:54,559
Energy that you'd be empathetic and have compassion.

960
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:06,820
And yet you have to get to, Hey, look, we've got a hump of today and we got to get going, you know, but I think that the positivity is a validation of, Hey, this is going to be a hard today.

961
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,659
This is hard because you got something else going on, but yes, we can.

962
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,159
And yes, we will.

963
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:20,579
And then you roll up your sleeves and whatever that is, they see you also as a hard worker.

964
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:29,539
As somebody who's not hypocritical, uh, et cetera, because as a leader, your talent has to be to delegate.

965
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:39,280
You, I mean, you, you know, when I say hard worker, if, if you're constantly down in the engine room, then you have no sight of where the ship is going.

966
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,659
And so you have to, you know, modulate, you have to be up there.

967
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:48,539
Then you kind of got to move down there, get into the boiler room, be empathetic, validate.

968
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,559
I'm going to say, Hey, that's a great.

969
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,320
Especially when things are good.

970
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,940
We call it praise prompt and lead.

971
00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:01,199
The prompt is, Hey, there's what you did with the shovel to get the coal in the stove.

972
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,679
Let me show you a better way, you know, and now you show it.

973
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,920
So you're kind of being critical because you say you've got a better way that he might slope his shoulders or she might slope her shoulders.

974
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:15,780
And so you have to say, Hey, you see that body language there?

975
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:20,519
That's not going to play well because we're going to move through a couple of buyers here.

976
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,579
And so we need to, to have a better shoulders back, eyes up, greet them.

977
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:26,539
You're important.

978
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,539
And I, I think you're damn good at what you do.

979
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:36,380
I think you're the best, but I'm going to tell you right now, you got to do better with those shoulders back and give me some eye contact.

980
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,579
We got that boom.

981
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,960
And then walk away from them.

982
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,460
You don't have to sit there and admonish them and you praise them.

983
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:43,320
You gave them a compliment.

984
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:48,599
You prompted them, you told them and showed them what you want and now get away from them, you know?

985
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,960
And so those are all methodologies.

986
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:56,820
So positivity sounds good, but it's amoeba-like and you have to be more specific with it.

987
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:05,159
And you have to have techniques and skills in order to distribute it so that it's not just a puff of smoke.

988
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:06,119
Brilliant.

989
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,280
I love that idea of validating the negative, isn't it?

990
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,440
Because that false positivity, yeah, people see through that, you know, really quickly, really quickly.

991
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,179
And I love your method of being able to deliver it in that particular way.

992
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:18,340
Okay.

993
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:18,739
Leaders.

994
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,440
We see, you know, in this.

995
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,519
21st century style who have great impact like you are really conscious about how they create and share their vision.

996
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,500
How have you gone about creating and sharing your vision?

997
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,199
Well, ask questions.

998
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:44,300
Example given is that if you're, you know, running your own corporation or you're a coach, you know, you go in and you paint your vision, but there's no connection.

999
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,460
You're going to end up a dud.

1000
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,539
My point is, is that an I am she.

1001
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:59,659
So now your first meeting, you hand out an I am sheet to your team, say six workers, whatever your company, a startup, whatnot.

1002
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:07,320
Within the three pages, you say, hey, worst tragedy in your life, favorite possession, favorite food.

1003
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:12,340
You know, some of those specific questions that might take you 10 years to learn about your wife.

1004
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:14,000
It's amazing.

1005
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,079
All of a sudden, you know, you're at a party and it's 10 years later and you hear your wife say something.

1006
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:19,320
You go, oh, I didn't know that.

1007
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,420
Well, why the hell did you?

1008
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,219
You know that, you know what I'm saying?

1009
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,960
Because I think too many times we don't take inventory.

1010
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:36,699
And I think that it's really important, one, to know how to ask great questions and how to note it before you get started on the vision of here's how I want our family to be.

1011
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,440
Here are the customs because it has to be collaborative.

1012
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,820
It's got to be we, not me.

1013
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,980
All those things that we know.

1014
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,500
But you better in this day and age, you better say that this is horizontal leadership.

1015
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,360
I'll.

1016
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,179
Be vertical when you want me to lead, because you know what?

1017
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:57,739
Players and employees don't want horizontal leadership all the time.

1018
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,780
They want leadership when the storm comes by the leader.

1019
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,920
And so, I mean, you know, you've got it's a balance of horizontal and vertical when the time is right.

1020
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:16,039
You know, like I said, is but you want to rotate the leadership example given.

1021
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:20,300
David Halperstam wrote a book called The 20 Years of Leadership.

1022
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,059
20th Century.

1023
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,800
He went over to Japan, hung out for a year, wrote a tiny little book.

1024
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,780
He's a Pulitzer Prize.

1025
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:29,420
You know, he's dead now, but he he wrote this book.

1026
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:40,260
And in essence, he was saying that the leaders came down on Fridays and that they would be on the conveyor belt and then they would sit and have lunch with the guys.

1027
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,960
They actually worked the conveyor belt.

1028
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,239
And they said, what idea?

1029
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,179
How can we take that step out to be more efficient?

1030
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:49,539
And then they would go back up to their towers, so to speak.

1031
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:50,280
With those.

1032
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,179
With those ideas of the workers, plus the workers saw them down there and they got to know their first name, et cetera, et cetera.

1033
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:09,559
So when we're talking about, again, methods and and how you do that, I think you you got to know what you're doing and you got to be confident again about what you're doing and what the vision is.

1034
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:12,000
But and saying that it's a we vision.

1035
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:13,659
Hey, I remember you said that.

1036
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,179
Give credit where credit's due.

1037
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,940
So like if you're an AFL coach or you're an NBL coach.

1038
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:27,539
You get all this information and you say, hey, I found out a Malcolm Gladwell outlier, blank, the tipping point.

1039
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:29,000
These are all books that he wrote.

1040
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:47,320
The only thing in all those books really that I got from him was common denominators, large amounts of information and saying, hey, what are the four or five bands of they had similar answers all the way through with a tragedy, for example.

1041
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,800
He's fatherless.

1042
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:50,059
He's fatherless.

1043
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,480
He's fatherless.

1044
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:58,559
So they have no model of what it really means to be a male, you know, in terms of a responsible male.

1045
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,679
There's a little boy in there and he's got a lot of dysfunction.

1046
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:11,900
And now you may be the first person that he's seen that expects him to be responsible in a way that you're asking him.

1047
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:19,880
And you're talking about this highfalutin vision and that poor guy's in there and he's 12 years old, even though he's in a 22 year old person's body.

1048
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:27,579
I mean, you know, how am I going to bridge that gap and what am I going to do to build trust when everything about the male is trust?

1049
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:40,159
Well, all of a sudden you bring in a female as a sports psychologist and that's his he has a good feeling about, well, that's an avenue to, you know, my mother or a female that helped him.

1050
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:50,159
And now he's with the sports psychologist and the sports psychologist is downloading you, not snitching, but saying, hey, you're going about this the wrong way with your.

1051
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:57,880
Star player. And so my point is the vision has to be inspirational.

1052
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:02,059
It has to be like, hey, we're all competitors.

1053
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,420
Does anybody in this room want to be the best of the best?

1054
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:08,699
You know, and everybody's going to raise their hand on that.

1055
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:11,699
That's a layup. Well, start with things that are easy.

1056
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:15,780
Inspirationally, don't start with something like, hey, you want to be a hard worker?

1057
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,139
I mean, that's not going to really, you know, get them going.

1058
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,920
But if you say, hey, we want to be the best of the best.

1059
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,699
And now let's say you had a champion with you on your first meeting and it could be another sport.

1060
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:30,619
And he takes five minutes right from there.

1061
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:35,920
He's a champion. Hey, tell me how it felt when you had the confetti coming down.

1062
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,559
What was the parade like? What was that medal like for you?

1063
01:02:39,579 --> 01:02:43,500
And all of a sudden he starts talking and you watch the eyes, the pupils.

1064
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,960
Man, they just, you know, they're like golf balls and then they go to balloons and then they go to helium balloons.

1065
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:58,980
I mean, my point is, is that, as you can see, I've had the luck of being around Magic Johnson for 10 years.

1066
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,380
I worked his camp. I watched him walk in when he was 23.

1067
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:15,219
I mean, you want to talk about a thoroughbred that had a sheen on him and the way he did it with the kids and the competing and the way he talked and the way he didn't know what he was saying and structure.

1068
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,400
In my opinion of, hey, here's how to do footwork.

1069
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:19,980
What he did was he calculated.

1070
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:26,699
He captivated them with somebody who came from abject poverty, who had a smile that lit up the earth.

1071
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:32,860
And now he all of a sudden he's with a six year old and he's, you know, taking the ball off him, giving the ball back.

1072
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,699
And all of a sudden there's 500 kids around him and he's high five and that.

1073
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,699
Well, what's that word? That's vision of inspiration.

1074
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:48,579
And like I said, is if you're not inspirational, get a speaker in front of the group that's inspirational and then go from there.

1075
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,079
But ultimately, that's.

1076
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:57,820
That inspiration is going to flare out if you don't go underneath it and say, I care about you for more than a competitor.

1077
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:04,340
There is the aha moment when all of a sudden that allows you to get underneath that.

1078
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,219
And you say in your first meeting painting the vision.

1079
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,219
Hey, man, close your eyes.

1080
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,619
We're going to put it through the uprights.

1081
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:15,619
And it's five, four, three.

1082
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:19,000
And all of a sudden you get to it and you say, can you see it?

1083
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:21,860
Can you see it?

1084
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,260
All right, man, we've got a lot of work to do.

1085
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,159
Open your eyes.

1086
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:25,780
Boom, boom.

1087
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,079
Now that's one mechanism of creating a vision.

1088
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:36,199
And now you have the guy who's won the medal behind you to say, OK, what was your hardest day?

1089
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:43,260
And all of a sudden he starts talking about just a monster day of what he did, say, five, eight years ago.

1090
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:50,139
And they go, God dang, we already did that, you know, or we're doing it harder than that.

1091
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:50,880
Well, that's good.

1092
01:04:50,940 --> 01:05:00,579
And if you're not, he is also enhancing the picture of those lock steps that you've got to go through in order to put that ball through the uprights.

1093
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:01,579
That's pretty cool.

1094
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:10,940
So, again, as you can tell, I can go ad nauseum, but it's because of all the other people that have shown me the way.

1095
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:13,420
So much gold everywhere, Mike.

1096
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,219
Again, I love the I am sheet, isn't it?

1097
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,820
The sort of leapfrog, maybe 10 years of trying to get to know.

1098
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,960
Luke, here's what I challenge you to do.

1099
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:26,059
Make three pages of questions you want to ask your wife.

1100
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,960
And, you know, write the question down and say, all right, what's your favorite book?

1101
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,139
OK, what's your favorite meal?

1102
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,639
What if you had one song and it's the last song you ever listened to?

1103
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,059
What's it going to be?

1104
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:43,980
And you're going to get answers off of those three pages of whatever you make up.

1105
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:45,019
You can't be wrong.

1106
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:49,000
And I promise you seven of the 10 answers you didn't know.

1107
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:50,039
I promise.

1108
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,260
You know, that's that's that's a great day.

1109
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,500
That is a great day.

1110
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,179
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

1111
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,780
I can do that today.

1112
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:07,659
I've been married 35 years and I promise you, if I start making up random questions, really random questions, I would probably be on the same strike rate.

1113
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,639
So my point is, you know, dare to be different.

1114
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:15,440
Dare to build your own dream.

1115
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,300
Dare to say stuff that is outrageous.

1116
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,139
Hey, if you fall over.

1117
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:21,920
It's all part of the process.

1118
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:26,300
But not daring and not dreaming and not going after it.

1119
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,199
It's bullshit.

1120
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,019
I love it.

1121
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,559
Married 20 years coming up this year.

1122
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,219
I will take up your challenge.

1123
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,320
It's and you're right.

1124
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,159
I've already there's questions that are coming to mind.

1125
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,440
And there was something I just picked up when you're talking about that.

1126
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,960
I interviewed a brilliant guy that I'm sure you'd be interested.

1127
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:42,300
Dr.

1128
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:47,099
Arnie Rubenstein is bringing back rites of passage to the Western world.

1129
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:49,519
Thousands and thousands of years where we're sophisticated.

1130
01:06:49,519 --> 01:07:12,199
Particularly at bringing boys through, because tribes worked out in Arnie's words, he was a GP for 12 years and saw the trouble with adolescent boys and now also girls that if you didn't usher young boys into manhood properly, then civilization didn't work and he was bemoaning the fact that so many leaders around the world has still got that childlike way about them.

1131
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:18,079
They haven't become healthy males and he's got a sophisticated way of making sure we bring back those rites of passage.

1132
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:19,500
And I saw a language very.

1133
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:29,679
Similar to what you were talking about dealing with athletes that had never been led in a way with a healthy understanding of, of how it is to be a proper male in the environment you're talking about.

1134
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:35,360
Um, I wanted to move, uh, to curiosity because it's a word that we see come up with leaders a lot.

1135
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,559
And, and, and I tell you what, I mean, the curiosity coming out of you is explosive.

1136
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:42,380
You know, is that, is that a word that resonates?

1137
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:43,820
Yes.

1138
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:45,719
I mean, I'm curious about you.

1139
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,619
I'm curious about 20 years.

1140
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:49,280
I'm curious about your son.

1141
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:50,380
Your daughter.

1142
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:56,679
I mean, yeah, they're noted first note on, but you know, uh, yes.

1143
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:04,860
You know, and, and, and asking questions and nurturing questions and also saying, Hey, I don't have the answer to that.

1144
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,000
Let me go about getting the answer.

1145
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:19,500
But the trust is built on follow through of saying that it took me two weeks to get to the bottom of that, um, a week, but the follow through the act of saying, Hey, I went out and I said, Hey, I'm going to do this.

1146
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,260
I searched that.

1147
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,319
And here's what I've gotten.

1148
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,100
I don't know if it's the right answer.

1149
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,340
You've got humility in there.

1150
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,560
You've got the search, but the key to all of it is follow through.

1151
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,720
Trust is built on the backs of, uh, a woman of her word, a man of her word.

1152
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,979
And when your word breaks, it's okay.

1153
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:46,819
I mean, you're not, it's understandable, but not excusable, but you say, Hey, you know, I let you down here.

1154
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,420
And so this thing about I'm a man.

1155
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:49,479
I'm a man.

1156
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:55,060
My word really, well, let's put the video on you for 20 years and see where you broke it.

1157
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,039
And, you know, and, and everybody does.

1158
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,479
So my point is, you know, your word is your handshake.

1159
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,220
Okay, fine.

1160
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,300
But where you clench the deal is the follow through.

1161
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:05,779
Okay.

1162
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:07,779
I bagged the groceries on there.

1163
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,300
The lady thanks me.

1164
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,859
And you, you put the groceries in her car.

1165
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,579
All right.

1166
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:17,539
And, and she say, she, she, she gives you a $5, you know, and she says, thank you.

1167
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:19,460
And you look her in the eye and you say, everything.

1168
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,119
Every time you're here, Martha, I got you.

1169
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:22,939
All right.

1170
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:27,140
So now the third time she comes through three months later and you don't got her.

1171
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,420
Well, you know, you broke your word.

1172
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,020
I mean, if we look at ourselves in the mirror, it happens all the time.

1173
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,539
So what you're trying to do is win the percentages of the follow through.

1174
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:49,340
And so, you know, being curious is one thing, but be curious with essence and be curious with purpose.

1175
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:53,680
Don't be curious just because you're going to ask a rhetorical question.

1176
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,600
Cause you want everybody to think that, you know, I'm curious and that means I'm going to be smart.

1177
01:09:58,779 --> 01:09:59,180
Yeah.

1178
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,020
You're a smart ass is what you are.

1179
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,880
It's, it's, it's brilliant.

1180
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:11,899
The next dimension I wanted to talk to you about, we see leaders are really conscious of communicating with clarity.

1181
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:12,779
You're an English major.

1182
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:20,159
Uh, you went down a path and, and, you know, clearly you've got a way of communicating that, uh, is outstanding.

1183
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,039
And how have you thought about that in terms of your leadership?

1184
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:40,159
Um, you already pointed to it, but I'll, I think it's, it's worth repeating is that it's important with your language that you understand that it's a tool and you have to have discipline of tongue, a well-placed F-bomb or, uh, BS or whatever.

1185
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:41,199
I love it.

1186
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:42,760
You know, and I'm, I'm, I'm not.

1187
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:46,060
I'm not going to be stodgy about that, but I have discipline of tongue.

1188
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,979
If I'm around young ladies and at a party, I'm, I have discipline of mouth.

1189
01:10:52,359 --> 01:11:02,479
I'm not cursing and I'm not, you know, gonna, gonna just tell a body joke after body joke, but a good body joke with everybody leaning in is awesome.

1190
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,180
You know?

1191
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:06,279
So, I mean, you have some shouser to you.

1192
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:12,420
I would rather be known as shouserian and slapstick than I would, you know, like, Oh, aren't I witty?

1193
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:16,560
You know, I, I know there's a place for wit, but I'm not that guy.

1194
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:20,119
Um, but you know, uh, offer me red wine.

1195
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,960
I can drink it.

1196
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:25,760
But if you say, Hey, I'd rather have a beer and a Barbie that's, I mean, teach his own.

1197
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:36,000
And yet I can dress up and, and, and, and, and have a pinfold Grange with anybody, you know, who couldn't and who wouldn't.

1198
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,600
But my, my, my point is that I think that you, you have to modulate, uh, with your language.

1199
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,760
Language is the bouquet, uh, to the heart, if you will.

1200
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:51,779
Um, language allows you to open a human being up.

1201
01:11:52,399 --> 01:12:03,439
Understanding does, um, if you have to tantalize or poetry or prose that, that is hits a nerve, uh, is the essence.

1202
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,000
Like I said, is the example I said is you got a guy suffering at practice.

1203
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:11,340
His body language is an aberration.

1204
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:12,520
And then you,

1205
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,520
you take them off to the side and your arms around me and say, Hey man, what gives?

1206
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,039
And he said, Hey, I had a really bad day.

1207
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:26,439
And he said, Hey, you know, Graham, I want you to know that that very same thing happened to me.

1208
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:30,920
There's going to be an explosion within that young man.

1209
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,859
If you're authentic and you're truthful about that shared experience.

1210
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:42,199
Well, the language of connecting and triggering and igniting people.

1211
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,180
So that they want to talk to you again.

1212
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:48,119
That's it's everything.

1213
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:57,180
So the study of vernacular metaphors, you gotta be a great storyteller and we're none of us are when we start out.

1214
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:06,199
But example, given Brian Gorgian, you know, I wanted to know when they won the Rose gold, the game before what happened to Mills.

1215
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:12,439
Mills goes in there with Joe Ingalls and Brian Gorgian walks in and they are, I mean, they.

1216
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:18,199
They had been forth two times over and now it looks like they're going to be forth again.

1217
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,960
Here comes Brian through the doors, you know, and everybody is hang dog.

1218
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,880
It's dark in the locker room.

1219
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:25,659
All right.

1220
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:27,039
And then here he comes.

1221
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,260
Hey, get your head up.

1222
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:34,619
We just almost beat the United States of America.

1223
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:36,460
We will revel in that later.

1224
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,239
And you know, Joe Ingalls was looking at him.

1225
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,760
Oh, have you lost your mind?

1226
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,640
And he goes, no, man.

1227
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,140
That is a.

1228
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:47,680
Staging and he looks right at Mills and he says, you will lead us to the promised land.

1229
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:48,739
All right.

1230
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,619
I feel that you percolated against the American USA dudes.

1231
01:13:53,779 --> 01:14:00,579
We're going to do something nobody has ever done in the history of basketball for Australia.

1232
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:02,159
The flag is high.

1233
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,979
And this is an American.

1234
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:09,640
This is not somebody that was born in Australia, but he loves Australia like it's his own.

1235
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,039
And so he hits a nerve.

1236
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:17,560
And Mills does something that nobody else has done in the history of the Olympics.

1237
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,819
I don't care if he's white, he's brown, he's, you know, he's, he's purple.

1238
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,939
He gets 42 points and they broke the sound barrier.

1239
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:33,859
And in the history of the books, when Mills and, and, and Patty's dead and Joe's dead,

1240
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:40,439
God forbid, and Brian's gone, somebody is going to have to read about that team and

1241
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:42,319
the coaching staff that was.

1242
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:47,000
The first of all time for Australian basketball.

1243
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:53,659
And so my point is that inspiration, uh, didn't know if you were going to win, but put it

1244
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:56,699
on the line with his players, got their heads up.

1245
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,600
You saw the performance that's magic.

1246
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:06,720
And to me, that happens every day you go into a supermarket or you go down the street.

1247
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:12,220
You can tell when somebody's suffering to take five minutes, you know, and tell,

1248
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:17,359
you know, male or female and just say, Hey man, what, what do you got?

1249
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,560
What do you got?

1250
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,100
What's going on?

1251
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:24,800
And to take that five, 10, 15 minutes, you mean to tell me you're more important than

1252
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:30,460
that, but, and then you could lift that person and get them to another day.

1253
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:32,560
There's nothing better than that.

1254
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:40,479
That rose gold, uh, the world championship to me, helping somebody else on the same level.

1255
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:41,640
You can have the ring.

1256
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,520
I gave my ring to my wife.

1257
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:45,960
She's responsible for the ring.

1258
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,140
So when they gave it to me and, you know, Adam Silver's there, and then the owner's

1259
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:54,020
handing the ring, the ceremony, and we're going back to the locker room.

1260
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,340
I, well, I actually, I did it before.

1261
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:58,319
There's still the ceremonies going on.

1262
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,300
I just got the box and I said, it's yours.

1263
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:02,460
She couldn't get back to her seat.

1264
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,420
All the fans in there wanted to take pictures with the ring, all of that.

1265
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,300
Some of the other guys were pissed off because I gave my ring to my wife.

1266
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,220
And I said,

1267
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:17,500
you know, they were going, God, man, you made me look bad, you know, but my point

1268
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,460
wasn't that, that my point is get your priorities straight.

1269
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,180
You know, that's a great goal.

1270
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,439
And that's what is, but is that where we're going to stop?

1271
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,819
And is that who I am?

1272
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:28,699
No, it's a great little thing.

1273
01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:33,659
And I want excellence and I want the ring like everybody else, but it's not the essence

1274
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,340
of what it's about.

1275
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,979
And that's what I'm saying is there's Brian Gorgian.

1276
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,619
He's my best friend in the whole world.

1277
01:16:40,619 --> 01:16:41,619
I played for his father.

1278
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:50,100
And so I've got a great, great role model who's teaching me how to be humble and understand

1279
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:57,239
that there's much thing, you know, been, been trophies and, and giving somebody life on

1280
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:01,460
the day of saying, Hey, you're, I, you know, that's bad.

1281
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,020
That's bad.

1282
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:02,680
And that's bad.

1283
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:08,359
But I want you to know that me stopping here was because of that purple dress that you've

1284
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:08,840
got on.

1285
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,460
Stop me.

1286
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,680
I think you look pretty good.

1287
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,600
I think you look pretty good.

1288
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,460
And I'm going to say that straight up.

1289
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:14,960
All right.

1290
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:16,739
Second is I love your energy.

1291
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:17,779
You're here today.

1292
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,800
You've had these three devastating things happen to you, but here you are.

1293
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:28,579
And to me, that's the essence of a good day, you know, and that's what I'm saying is get

1294
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:29,199
base sense.

1295
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,659
Forget about the home runs.

1296
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,899
Language is the bouquet to the heart.

1297
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:35,520
That, uh, that is brilliant.

1298
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,680
And my hair stands on the back of the neck when you tell, uh, you know, gorgeous story,

1299
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:40,579
the great Brian Gorgian.

1300
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,720
I've had the great privilege of doing this, sitting down with him in the podcast and,

1301
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:48,600
and hearing, uh, that story, uh, you know, come to life and seize that moment, you know,

1302
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,359
history in Australia.

1303
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:53,539
And as you said, through language and talk about a great storyteller, Brian Gorgian,

1304
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:55,720
uh, is world-class on that.

1305
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:57,220
And, um, it is a great moment.

1306
01:17:57,359 --> 01:17:59,960
And, uh, he's the funniest human being in the world.

1307
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:01,399
I don't, he is.

1308
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:02,899
Oh my God.

1309
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:05,300
Oh, and, and put a beer in him.

1310
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,500
It is like fireworks.

1311
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,039
It's fireworks.

1312
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:10,359
He, I love him.

1313
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:10,659
I love him.

1314
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:15,739
We, we mentioned the collaboration that, uh, probably brought this conversation to life

1315
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:17,380
and clearly a passion about collaboration.

1316
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,699
We see leaders value that more than ever.

1317
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:21,659
I mean, how important is collaboration been for you?

1318
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,220
Uh, it's everything.

1319
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:28,159
And that's why the, the, the, the payback on collaboration is don't you dare.

1320
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:33,560
If you've had other people help you make sure that your door is always open and, you know,

1321
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,579
the word yes comes out of your mouth a lot.

1322
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,039
You can't always say yes, because sometimes you're just busy and those things come up,

1323
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:40,380
but sure.

1324
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,939
Share your information without charge, be fearless and understand that if you really

1325
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:49,560
believe in your self-esteem and who you are, there are no secrets.

1326
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:52,899
I don't think you have to give everything away.

1327
01:18:53,039 --> 01:19:00,000
That's not my point, but my point is be generous and be open and, you know, understand that

1328
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,880
you're no big deal.

1329
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:02,720
You know, nobody's a big deal.

1330
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,680
Don't do it that way.

1331
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,180
You know, do it the other way.

1332
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,239
And like you said, is I, was it Rubenstein Rubenstein?

1333
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,920
You were talking about earlier.

1334
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:12,699
Yeah.

1335
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:17,939
And what he's talking about are missing chips and building those chips within, uh, young

1336
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:24,420
men in particular, there's been an, uh, uh, you know, uh, an emasculation unintentionally

1337
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:31,319
of, of, uh, uh, generations now of young men who need to be shepherded through to, like

1338
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,359
I said, is know how to act and do certain things.

1339
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:40,260
But the problem is, is that the imprint or the modeling is, is broken.

1340
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:48,279
So you, you have to go through these arduous steps in order to reclaim that soul and who

1341
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,300
that young man ultimately is going to be because it's worth it.

1342
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,479
It's absolutely worth it.

1343
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:58,579
Uh, beautifully, uh, said my, but asking these two questions of all the leaders, I've had

1344
01:19:58,579 --> 01:20:02,460
the great privilege of sitting down with like yourself, uh, who has been the greatest leader

1345
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,159
in your life?

1346
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:08,100
Uh, in my life, uh, is Ed, Ed Gorge and Brian's father.

1347
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,140
Uh, and, and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1348
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,140
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and, uh,

1349
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,340
I can't leave out my own father.

1350
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:19,539
My, my father was a high-risk surgeon, OBGYN, started his clinic in a log cabin and ended

1351
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:23,539
up being, uh, 55 doctors, Tenenau Valley Clinic.

1352
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,920
It's, you know, timeless.

1353
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,760
It's still in Fairbanks, Alaska.

1354
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,880
And he was the essence of serving your community.

1355
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:34,060
Chief of staff, you go, uh, four years.

1356
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:36,460
He did it for 24 years.

1357
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,100
They vote you into the chair.

1358
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,720
He retired out of that chair with the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.

1359
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:51,159
If you go into Fairbanks and you at the time, he was delivering almost every baby in a community of 30,000.

1360
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,800
So he gave his heart and soul to a community.

1361
01:20:53,800 --> 01:21:06,880
Then you go to Ed Gorgian and just, you know, from being a model as a father to how he raised his sons to coaching me at a tender age where I was very vulnerable.

1362
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,859
I would say without question, those two.

1363
01:21:11,859 --> 01:21:19,500
And then finally, you know, being with my wife, Molly, for 35 years, you know, you have to be lucky.

1364
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:28,779
But I mean, so she as a leader of our family and the way she's done things to keep everything together, a full credit for her as well.

1365
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:30,720
Well said again.

1366
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,119
I love, as you said, the fortune to have great leaders in your life.

1367
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,100
And you went straight to it.

1368
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,859
There was no hesitation.

1369
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:37,979
And yeah.

1370
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:43,859
Fascinating to hear that in the spirit of collaboration and clear, that's a huge part of who you are already.

1371
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:48,000
And you're connecting with extraordinary leaders around the world, as we mentioned, and our passion for early.

1372
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:53,460
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, Mike, in any of your areas of passion, is there someone that springs to mind?

1373
01:21:54,159 --> 01:22:00,619
Oh, in a global way, John Wooden was in my life as a young man.

1374
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:05,619
And I hung on to his coattails and just kept learning from Coach Wooden.

1375
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:07,300
Pete Newell, who.

1376
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,640
I had mentioned it is unbelievable.

1377
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,359
I, George Karl, I worked for him and he was phenomenal.

1378
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:35,960
Obviously I mentioned Ed Gorgian, but if you want to talk about people that of fame, those three, George Karl Hall of Fame, Pete Newell Hall of Fame, and Brian Gorgian, again, he's a Hall of Famer in Australia.

1379
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,060
Everything that award that they have.

1380
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:53,659
They have over there for the highest awards that they give Brian's in that, that, that stratosphere and then I could go on and on because I have the underpinnings of moving out once a week, Matt LaFleur.

1381
01:22:53,659 --> 01:23:02,239
I mean, he's a young coach in the NFL and I seize the opportunity to go to his practice and shadow on we're building a relationship.

1382
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,460
So, I mean, I could go probably.

1383
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:22,539
At least 30 minutes and give you a pyramid of, of, of, uh, people, uh, within, uh, David Wheaton, you know, uh, what he introduced me to all these people in Australia and rules footy.

1384
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,819
And so Eddie Jones, I was up at the, you know, Canberra and I met Eddie Jones.

1385
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:31,939
He talked to the national team for, and I was helping the national team with Brian.

1386
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,279
And so I sat in on him.

1387
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:38,039
So when we see each other on the, the zoom meeting with the world.

1388
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:42,920
Symposium, it's like old home week, you know, and Hey Eddie, how you doing?

1389
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,960
Hey, Mike, how you doing?

1390
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,680
And so my point is Eddie Jones is very, very, very special.

1391
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:54,439
Charlie Walsh, you know, the greatest cycling coach that Australia has ever had.

1392
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:56,119
Somebody wants to argue that that's okay.

1393
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:57,680
Cause I don't know it like that.

1394
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:07,760
I just know that he was phenomenal with the Olympic team, Bill Nelson, who was the assistant coach with the national swimming team out of Newcastle.

1395
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:16,640
And I mean, I was all over Australia, you know, anybody that, that, that had something, I was, was, was on it.

1396
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:26,479
Um, so yeah, I mean, um, you know, Pat Riley, um, for five years, I watched him coach cause they used our gym at Loyola Marymount.

1397
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,220
So I was the caretaker of the key that let them in for their practices.

1398
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:32,859
And I didn't know really who he was.

1399
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,880
He was the announcer before he became the head coach.

1400
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,020
And so I just.

1401
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:45,020
Sat in there and had a little yellow pad and made notes, you know, on stuff and I knew magic Johnson.

1402
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:51,880
So, I mean, if I go into these places, it's like a bunch of capillaries.

1403
01:24:51,920 --> 01:25:04,939
I've, you know, I'm a wanderer in terms of knowledge and, uh, you know, things, you know, I, I think every sport women's volleyball, I can tell you that I used some netball.

1404
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,460
Routines on hand.

1405
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,060
Eye coordination.

1406
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,859
And, and pivots netball teachers.

1407
01:25:10,859 --> 01:25:13,119
And, and in particular, the women.

1408
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:20,359
That's why they have such a high rate of anterior cruciate tears is because of the jump stops and netball.

1409
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:28,100
But that's another story, but Jan Sterling, the best female coach in Australia that I ever, ever saw.

1410
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:38,039
And then I would put her in the top five male coaches for sure in Australia and her adroitness, the way she did what she did.

1411
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:39,520
When she was in Adelaide.

1412
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:40,720
Phenomenal.

1413
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:46,399
And so as you see, I feel terrible by leaving out another name.

1414
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,380
I can just go.

1415
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:53,979
I mean, Graham Corns was so good to me and I did go to a crow's practice and I watched him do what he did.

1416
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:59,220
And he has anybody who knows Graham Corns knows that he is really good with people.

1417
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,699
I mean, he makes you feel good when he walks away from a conversation because he's, he's upbeat.

1418
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,920
It's really hard for Graham Corns to be.

1419
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:08,319
Negative.

1420
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,619
You know, he's an upbeat human being in the way that he does what he does.

1421
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:19,399
But, you know, so my point is, is that everybody has a little bit to offer.

1422
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:23,539
And my guy, I think it's probably in some ways the, the, my favorite answer.

1423
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:36,699
And I've heard that from, from many people, but you can just say as a life of collecting knowledge and engaging with people, you know, an Australian netball coach to, you know, the, the highest levels of, of your sport and others.

1424
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:38,020
And, and some of the best in the world.

1425
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:46,939
You've clearly got a passion for that continued sharing and learning and, and the humility that comes across in everything you say, Mike, has been inspiring to listen to.

1426
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:52,159
I thank you so much for, for taking the time and it's been a great pleasure to spend the day with you.

1427
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:52,539
Thanks a lot.

1428
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:53,840
Yeah.

1429
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,159
Thank you, Luke.

1430
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,199
And thank Matt.

1431
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:04,100
And it's one of the best interviews, most insightful and laser like, and I, I can tell you really, really, really prepared.

1432
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,020
So I enjoyed it and good health to your family.

1433
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:11,659
I hope we get a, a beer with Brian Gorgian one day would be a lot of fun.

1434
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,680
So, well, I need to make that happen the next time we're around.

1435
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,300
So thanks again.
