00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,320
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:53,479
Mim Bartlett is a champion for strong, authentic leadership and well-being.

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,020
She's a qualified lawyer, psychotherapist, a sought-after coach facilitator,

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,799
human rights champion and gender equality advocate.

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,400
As a fluent Chinese speaker, she spent six years living and working

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,599
in China, Hong Kong and Singapore in law, sales and marketing.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,599
In 2015, Mim was recognised as one of the Financial Review's

17
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,700
100 Women of Influence.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,579
Mim's work focuses on connecting people, ideas and resources

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,700
that can lead to a better future.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,480
It's a personal fulfilment and social change in today's world.

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,920
In her work at Mim Bartlett Consulting, she challenges people

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,819
to define their unique passion or intersection, maximise their potential

23
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,859
and generate positive change for themselves, their work, their families

24
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,760
and the communities they serve.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,079
Mim, it's great to catch up with you today.

26
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,340
Thank you, Luke. It's wonderful to be here.

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,579
I'm always actually a bit nervous.

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm reading out someone's bio hoping that I...

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,459
I was looking at you going, have I got that accurate?

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,799
Have I missed out something important there?

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,879
I feel like it might have been short-changing you.

32
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,159
So, at the start...

33
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,659
Luke, I'm feeling a little bit embarrassed as I'm sitting here

34
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,500
hearing you say all that.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,700
So, yeah, beautiful. Thank you.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
It's you with all your accolades.

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,599
It's straight back at you.

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,700
Well, I look at your life.

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,040
It's an amazing story of leadership and contribution.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,260
I wanted to start by asking, where did that sense of drive come from

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,099
and also that sense of purpose and giving back to the community?

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,300
Yeah, it's a really good question.

43
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,740
Mum was really involved as a volunteer at a number of, like, hospitals

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,960
and also in Melbourne and did a lot of fundraising herself.

45
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,479
And then, you know, Dad did that in his own way.

46
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,979
I think going to Loretto, a Catholic school,

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,860
which had a really strong sense of social justice.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,879
So, you know, not that I'm aligned with everything around Catholicism,

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,840
that's for sure, but certainly their values around social justice

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,020
really, I think, stirred something inside me.

51
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,719
And so it was very easy for me to kind of do more

52
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,919
of that as I got older.

53
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,860
And, yeah, I think it really, like, invoked my passions.

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,120
Chatting to people in preparation for the catch-up,

55
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,580
they had this sense of you, even as a teenager,

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,860
that you were someone that looked like you were going to be

57
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,159
the best version of yourself, that even from the youngest possible age

58
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,780
there was this sense that you were on a path to constantly be the best.

59
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,819
Is that your recollection even at a young age?

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,759
Yeah.

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,139
That's funny.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,659
I think I know who you've been speaking to.

63
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,139
You can be.

64
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,580
Look, I have.

65
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,020
I've always been really driven and motivated and, yeah,

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,800
have wanted to be, I guess, the best I can be.

67
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,039
And I even remember when my parents sat us down and said

68
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,780
that they were going to divorce and I said to myself, you know,

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,340
after that conversation, I'm just not going to let this get in my way.

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,300
I've kind of, like, stopped me from, I don't want to kind of collapse

71
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,800
and be that kid.

72
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:42,780
Yeah.

73
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,879
So it was interesting.

74
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,199
Yeah, it has been.

75
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,520
Look, I have been really driven.

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Not around, like, title or status, but more around really just performing

77
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,520
at my best and being at my best, whatever I wanted to do.

78
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,439
And, no, I haven't always achieved that.

79
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,960
My God, I was a terrible lawyer.

80
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,759
I was terrible in marketing.

81
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't think I was a great therapist, but I've really,

82
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,819
so I did work for a brief time as a psychotherapist,

83
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,039
but I really feel I found my sweet spot in the work I do over the last 21 years.

84
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,060
But certainly my early years, I really don't feel I excelled at all

85
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,720
in my career.

86
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,660
I worked with some great companies and some great, you know,

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,899
law firms and things, but I don't think I did a great job.

88
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,639
Which is interesting to hear, isn't it?

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,220
Because you're, like anyone, there's always the ebbs and flows of life.

90
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,560
What age were you when mum and dad separated?

91
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,459
So I was in year seven.

92
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah.

93
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,120
And it was interesting, at a school like La Roche, a Catholic school,

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,800
I was the only girl in my year.

95
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,579
You know, like, I was pretty, pretty, you know, that wasn't common then.

96
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,860
You know, so it was, yeah, it was, I mean, thankfully,

97
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,680
there's more of that reflected now.

98
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,959
So, you know, kids whose parents come from a divorced or single family

99
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,779
don't feel that stigma.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,220
Yeah.

101
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,920
But, yeah, no, it was more on the unusual side, particularly Catholic school.

102
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,699
You forget how nuclear an event that is, isn't it?

103
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,500
For even now that it's, you know, 50% or more is the stat,

104
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,720
so we know that that's happening to half the population,

105
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,819
but it's still a massive part of your child.

106
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,600
And your memory was, that's pretty impressive at that age.

107
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
This is big, but it's not going to affect who I am.

108
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,959
Yeah, that's, I really, I mean,

109
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,699
I only kind of later reflect back and think of that.

110
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,279
That's right.

111
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,519
But there are also so many single-parent families these days

112
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,839
and single mothers and, you know, different types of families,

113
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:30,220
blended families, but same-sex families, you know, we didn't see that.

114
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:30,860
Yeah.

115
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,259
I didn't see that growing up at the school that I went to,

116
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,899
so it's lovely to see more of that.

117
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,879
And then you go on and you do a double degree,

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,019
Law and Arts at Melbourne University,

119
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,620
but your major in Mandarin Chinese, you know,

120
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,019
you humbly said that you weren't,

121
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,540
you weren't necessarily a great lawyer or great in sales,

122
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,959
but that is an amazing path to follow.

123
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,199
Where did the passion come to go down that path?

124
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,720
So I really enjoyed debating at school.

125
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,819
And so I thought I got good marks, you know, in HSC and thought,

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,420
why didn't I do law?

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,939
Because I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do

128
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,060
and I might be a barrister.

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,300
And I'd done French in year 12.

130
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,220
I'd enjoyed it.

131
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
I'd done well at it.

132
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,600
And I thought, now I've done a European language.

133
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,420
I'd love to do a different language.

134
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,040
And so at Melbourne Uni I went and interviewed the head

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,439
of the Russian, Chinese and Japanese departments,

136
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,220
just to kind of talk to them about the possibility

137
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,360
of me studying that language to get a feel for it.

138
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,300
And so in those days, it was the mid-80s.

139
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,420
Japanese was the flavour of the month

140
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,100
and everyone was studying Japanese.

141
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,639
And so I thought, I don't want to do that.

142
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,899
I want to do something a bit different.

143
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,180
And then I really liked the Chinese department head.

144
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,699
And so that's really why I chose Chinese.

145
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,759
But it was tough.

146
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,300
Because in first year, I was in the department head.

147
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,399
And I was in the department head.

148
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,459
And in my first year uni studying Chinese,

149
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,459
I was put in the same year as all the kids

150
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,259
who'd gone to schools like Caulfield Grammar

151
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,079
and Melbourne Grammar,

152
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,879
where Chinese was offered through school,

153
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,879
whereas Loretto didn't.

154
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,319
So I had to kind of catch up with them in the same,

155
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,959
you know, and they've done like 12 or six years of Chinese.

156
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,519
So it was pretty challenging that first year.

157
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,079
Like, and really hard,

158
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,740
because the characters are really hard to draw.

159
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,600
It's not like European language.

160
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,600
It's just the speaking.

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,079
You've got to do the characters as well.

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,480
So my friends teased me about how much I'd study

163
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,959
and all these.

164
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,319
But it was fantastic.

165
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,319
It opened so many interesting doors and opportunities,

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,560
particularly China was communist, very communist then.

167
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,800
And so it was really interesting

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,079
because there weren't many women

169
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,439
and many people studying it in those days.

170
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,980
It's an amazing mindset to take that on, isn't it?

171
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,959
Without any background and then to become fluent in Chinese

172
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,620
is an amazing achievement.

173
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,980
To jump forward to a bit of Min Bartlett Consulting,

174
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,740
and I, you know, reading a lot about it

175
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,839
and love the language that,

176
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,920
the use, and I reflect a bit of it back to you.

177
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,819
Inspire and support personal transformation,

178
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,120
authentic leadership, as I said in the intro,

179
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,220
coach people to lead more purposeful lives,

180
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,060
to have a greater clarity in all aspects of their life.

181
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,620
It's a global business.

182
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,319
You work across Asia, UK and Europe.

183
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,959
Your passion for authentic leadership,

184
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,180
can you talk about that?

185
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,800
Yeah, look, that's such a big question.

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
It's for me about really being yourself.

187
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,319
And I think there's so much pressure in our culture

188
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:13,439
to be yourself.

189
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,899
To be something that other people want you to be.

190
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,980
And so I really want to empower and encourage people

191
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,879
to be truly themselves, which takes a lot of confidence

192
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,639
and to also really be intentional about how they want to lead

193
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,220
and who they want to be, not just professionally,

194
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,019
but also in their personal lives.

195
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,740
And really, because we know that when you're flourishing

196
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,960
in your personal life, you bring all that engagement

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,759
and joy to work and kind of, I'm probably going,

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,559
I'm a bit ahead of myself, but, you know,

199
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,779
corporates and employers are now understanding

200
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,059
that we need to like reflect and consider

201
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,600
and invest in the whole person.

202
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,460
And so that's been a big shift by corporates,

203
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,779
I think, aided and abetted by COVID,

204
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,340
really seeing the impact of mental health

205
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,039
and what that's meant to people

206
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,480
and the way they show up at work.

207
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,159
And so, and I think leadership has really evolved

208
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,419
over the last couple of decades.

209
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,539
And it's been great seeing that EQ and kind of,

210
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,639
just self-awareness has come much more to the fore

211
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,080
than in previous years where IQ has been, you know,

212
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,700
the dominant kind of, you know, the it factor.

213
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,059
Yeah, it's brilliant, Mam.

214
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,100
It's exactly what we sort of identified

215
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,779
as that real shift in leadership.

216
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,799
And, you know, you sum that up beautifully.

217
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,419
In my mind, it's sort of, you know,

218
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,679
away from the old hierarchy and command and control

219
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,159
and the boss with the big corner office

220
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,659
who intimidated people and, you know,

221
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,220
you either towed the line, you didn't get a voice,

222
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:43,799
you didn't get a,

223
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,419
and now we're seeing this whole generation

224
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,700
of people understanding exactly your language.

225
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,320
If you care about people authentically

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
and you look after them

227
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,460
and you've got a bit of your own self-awareness

228
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,240
and a bit of your own self-reflection,

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,259
it's not only is it a more harmonious environment,

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,299
it's a more productive environment as well.

231
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,139
And is that what you're seeing,

232
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,159
that the opportunity's there for us, you know,

233
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,379
to share that message in a more powerful way?

234
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,220
Absolutely.

235
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,019
People leave organisations because of poor leaders

236
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:13,460
and people,

237
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,059
go to organisations because of great leaders

238
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:19,200
and leadership has been really tipped upside down

239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,179
and it is exciting because also there's,

240
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,759
organisations are much flasher in their structures now

241
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,159
and so, you know,

242
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,840
employers are kind of not like waiting to kind of

243
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,539
to anoint people to be leaders

244
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,259
but they're wanting them to step up as a leader

245
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,179
kind of regardless of what level you're at,

246
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,340
that whole piece around self-leadership

247
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,179
that I know that you're big on at a leader

248
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,200
and just knowing that,

249
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,159
every time, you know,

250
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,399
everywhere you behave,

251
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,419
you have an impact on culture

252
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,080
and so to be really intentional and mindful

253
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,580
about the impact that you can have,

254
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,019
both personally and professionally

255
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,259
because whether you like it or not,

256
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,480
you are impacting others

257
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,899
and you are, you know,

258
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,039
creating culture and impacting culture.

259
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,279
So, yeah, I think to be really purposeful about that.

260
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,539
And we're seeing that, Mim,

261
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,779
in the sporting world,

262
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
which is, you know,

263
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,820
where I've spent a fair bit of my working life.

264
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,980
It's a massive shift.

265
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
The era that I grew up playing in,

266
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,960
it was really blunt and brutal

267
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,460
when you either coped or you didn't.

268
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,799
And we sort of laugh a little bit

269
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,340
about how ridiculous it was, you know,

270
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,100
someone standing at the front

271
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,279
personally abusing you on a regular basis

272
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,580
and you either could cope with that or you couldn't,

273
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,639
but pretty sad really

274
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,200
because you look back and you think,

275
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,580
and in fairness to those guys,

276
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
they didn't know any different.

277
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,700
They didn't have any skills really to do any better,

278
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,539
but it probably pushed a lot of people away

279
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,240
who haven't had great experiences.

280
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,940
But there is,

281
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,419
it's spawned a new generation.

282
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,139
These next generation of senior coaches,

283
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,220
they've got great care and great,

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,039
and they just worked out it's smarter and it's better.

285
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
If you buy into someone

286
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,080
and you care about them as a whole person,

287
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,559
they're going to perform better.

288
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:57,659
Absolutely.

289
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,320
No, no question.

290
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,100
That would have been pretty, pretty brutal.

291
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,639
And I think there are, you know,

292
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,700
there's some cultures in corporate

293
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,179
that still have got those old remnants

294
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,179
and particularly more the male dominated industries.

295
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,740
Because I think as more women

296
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,539
get into more senior leadership positions,

297
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,500
they bring a slightly different type of leadership

298
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,200
and more collaborative, compassionate,

299
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,860
dare I say loving.

300
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,440
Yeah.

301
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,659
They actually really care and they bring more of that.

302
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,539
And that's not to put men down.

303
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,460
It's more the men have been more socialized

304
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,639
to be a certain way and to hide their vulnerability

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,539
and to not share emotions so much.

306
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,419
So it's very understandable,

307
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,299
but it's very important that the culture's changing.

308
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,860
And I honestly think that with the change,

309
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,340
recently in the federal government,

310
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,980
that a more inclusive, collaborative,

311
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:49,779
like compassionate leadership is being modeled.

312
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,000
And I saw that a couple of days

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,639
after the election result already in corporates,

314
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,820
very senior leaders talking about

315
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,860
how they already feel that a different type of leadership

316
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,519
is being modeled,

317
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,679
which will trickle down into corporates.

318
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:05,419
Yeah, which is brilliant, isn't it?

319
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,960
Even my own experience in recent times

320
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,240
being around many more female leaders,

321
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,659
it's just,

322
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,200
the ego's gone immediately.

323
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,559
It's just taken that heat out of the room

324
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:20,419
and the intelligence and the sense of just wanting

325
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,059
to get on and do a great job.

326
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,460
And I think it's an interesting conversation, isn't it?

327
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,360
The fact that it's taken so long to get here

328
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,340
and there's still such a long way to go,

329
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,899
but clearly that is something that you're doing.

330
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,779
And I want to talk about so many things with you.

331
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,799
There's so much to get through,

332
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,799
but I mean, to me, you teach about purpose and passion,

333
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,500
but you live it in everything you do.

334
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,759
And, you know, catching up with you in recent times,

335
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,960
straight away, you're onto the things that matter

336
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,000
and that are purposeful.

337
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,980
And I wanted to share a few of them.

338
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,899
And one of the first things we sat down last time,

339
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,700
you mentioned it's Time We Talk,

340
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,720
which is a violence prevention project

341
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,460
that supports young people and parents and schools

342
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
and communities in general

343
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,440
to address the influence of pornography.

344
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,820
And it's not an easy topic to discuss.

345
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,100
I found it confronting.

346
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,340
I found it even as, you know, as a parent of four,

347
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,799
it's like, God, there's an elephant in the room there

348
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,539
that a lot of us don't know where to start,

349
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,539
but it's one of many things you're passionate about.

350
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,139
Can you tell us about why you delved into this space?

351
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,860
Because look, I forgot to ask you,

352
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,320
did you read that article I sent you,

353
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,879
the Mamma Mia article?

354
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,559
Yeah, I did.

355
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,279
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,320
It's confronting.

357
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,899
It's really good.

358
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,299
That's such a good one to share.

359
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,639
So I found out about it in 2012.

360
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,139
I have twin boys, Nick and Rich,

361
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,240
and they were in year seven.

362
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,480
And they came home and told me about

363
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,740
the large number of kids who are watching porn

364
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,539
on their iPhones and iPads at school.

365
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,879
And so they were in year seven.

366
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,960
And that really shocked me.

367
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,980
And I thought, look, I need to do something about this.

368
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,759
So I researched and found out about a project

369
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,460
called Reality and Risk.

370
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,220
And you'll write the website, itstimewetalk.com.

371
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,080
And the Victorian Women's Trust,

372
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,639
which is a fantastic not-for-profit in Melbourne

373
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,179
advocating for women's rights,

374
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,240
they were working with them to raise funds

375
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,379
because they needed more funds.

376
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,320
And so I sourced an introduction

377
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,480
to them and was really shocked

378
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
when I found out where pornography had gone.

379
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,259
So I don't watch porn, so it was all very new to me.

380
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,240
But what I learned was that mainstream porn

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,679
has become so much more violent these days.

382
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,720
And so just kind of a few stats

383
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,100
to kind of bring that to life.

384
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,240
So the best-selling porn, 48% of best-selling porn

385
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,220
is verbally aggressive to women.

386
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,299
So you're whore.

387
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,019
You're whatever.

388
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,940
88% of best-selling porn is physically aggressive.

389
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,539
So choking, slapping and gagging.

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,940
And then 94% of it is being directed at females

391
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,980
who express pleasure whilst being treated that way.

392
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,039
So porn not only suggests that violence against women is sexy,

393
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,139
it's like, it's erotic.

394
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
So it's really eroticising violence against women.

395
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,980
And so because it is the most prominent sex educator

396
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
for young people,

397
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,279
and it's not just for women,

398
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,259
and the stats around 90% of boys and 60% of girls

399
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,860
have seen porn often before they've often first kissed.

400
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,240
Yeah.

401
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
So, and it's such a,

402
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:27,440
it's just really shaping their idea of sex and relationships.

403
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,299
So I wanted to do something about that

404
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,700
because I was really appalled at that.

405
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,559
And 30% of all internet traffic is porn.

406
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,899
So it's such a big industry.

407
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,259
So I was really excited to hear about Marie Crabb

408
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,899
and Dave Corlett's work.

409
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,299
And so what I did was they were looking to raise money

410
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,799
for their secondary school's education kit,

411
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,720
which is brilliant,

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
which I brought into a number of schools

413
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,159
and got friends kind of to, you know,

414
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,340
mobilise friends such as our mutual friends,

415
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,159
to bring it into other schools

416
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,860
and to educate parents and young people about it.

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,840
Yeah.

418
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,019
And what I love about you, Mim,

419
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,740
is that, you know, people see this challenge,

420
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,920
you go and do something about it in almost every sense.

421
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,259
And that is a whole other podcast on its own to deal into.

422
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:13,940
And as you said, it is, in some ways,

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
you're left in the room, but, you know, me included,

424
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,819
it's, I was telling you one of my oldest,

425
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,420
you know, I think he was 11 or 12,

426
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,759
came home and just said, I've seen something I can't,

427
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,640
I don't feel well, you know, it's, you know,

428
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,660
growing up someone might've had a magazine

429
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,119
that you might've been able to see,

430
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,740
which was a nude picture of a woman or,

431
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,140
which might've been the,

432
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,900
what you're now getting access to

433
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,480
is this incredibly hardcore violent,

434
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,859
that's shaping, you know, the next generation.

435
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,220
So.

436
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:44,000
So again, I'm going to move on to your other,

437
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,519
because there's so many of them

438
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,660
and that's not to discount

439
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,240
how important that conversation is.

440
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,880
And it certainly has me thinking on a whole heap of levels,

441
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,880
but you throw yourself into incredible causes

442
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,740
and I wanted to mention them.

443
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,220
You mentioned to me as well last time,

444
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,339
the rites of passage for young people

445
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,700
and how that's now become something

446
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,240
that's missed really in our lives.

447
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,859
Dr. Arne Rubenstein is someone that you've connected with.

448
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,819
Can you just share a little bit on that one

449
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,420
and why that's so important as well?

450
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,119
Well, firstly, Luke, good on you

451
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,339
for having the conversation

452
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,619
because it is a really hard conversation,

453
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,480
but it is so important.

454
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,900
And it's important that the fathers

455
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,160
are having these conversation

456
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,920
as well as the mothers

457
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
or whatever same sex relationship you're in,

458
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,579
especially with the young boys

459
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,720
that their fathers are also talking about this.

460
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,640
And there are some great resources

461
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,660
on that website to help you

462
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,380
because a lot of people are highly uncomfortable

463
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,720
talking about this.

464
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,059
And yeah, you know, my boys are squirming,

465
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,759
you know, even though like they're used to

466
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,259
kind of me bring up all this type of thing.

467
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,819
Um, so, uh, the Rites of Passage program

468
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,619
is just wonderful.

469
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,640
It's a work, as you say, of Dr. Arne Rubenstein,

470
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:54,059
who is globally recognized and an author and speaker.

471
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,440
And he goes into hundreds of schools worldwide,

472
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,079
as well as running these Rites of programs

473
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,079
on his property in Mullumbimby, New South Wales.

474
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,099
And he is a doctor and he felt quite,

475
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,200
he was a GP and felt quite disillusioned

476
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,940
with the number of,

477
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,559
you know, teenage boys

478
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,380
that would come into his practice

479
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,960
that he knew as young boys

480
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,759
who were like, he would describe

481
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,220
a shell of their former selves.

482
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,000
And he wanted to do something different

483
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
about how they were kind of marking

484
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
their turning point from young boys,

485
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,279
from teenagers into kind of young men

486
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,180
and felt that our Western culture

487
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,299
around drinking and kind of risk-taking behavior

488
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,019
wasn't a great initiation.

489
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,740
And so he did some research globally,

490
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,559
best practice, indigenous cultures

491
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,039
and psychology and created this incredible five-day program

492
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,319
where fathers and sons or carers,

493
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,599
if you don't have a father, go with them.

494
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,420
And he works with about 20 young men

495
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,079
and 20 adults at a time.

496
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,859
And it's really bringing them together

497
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,900
in a very safe psychological space

498
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,759
where the men do a lot of sharing

499
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,880
about very intimate and very important topics

500
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
that you wouldn't normally discuss with your son.

501
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,980
And the young boys hear different perspectives

502
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,259
from all sorts of men.

503
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:10,819
But once again, very, very,

504
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:10,920
very important.

505
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,319
And then there is an actual rite of passage

506
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,480
that's obviously secret,

507
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,759
kind of secret men's business,

508
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,720
but it's held really safely

509
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,759
where the young men have to do something

510
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,839
to kind of move into the next stage.

511
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,079
And there's beautiful acknowledgement

512
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,099
by the older men.

513
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,839
And it's extremely bonding

514
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,039
and it's great for everyone's self-awareness.

515
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,819
And I love it because for many reasons,

516
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,039
but often the fathers think they're going for their sons

517
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,200
and that's incredible.

518
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,039
But what happens is that

519
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:40,819
it opens up a new world for them.

520
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,700
It opens up the men's hearts

521
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,259
for many of them who haven't done any work

522
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,880
or themselves

523
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,200
and it increases their self-awareness

524
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,500
and that has a ripple effect

525
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,940
when they go home to their relationships

526
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,680
and the way they parent their other kids

527
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,839
and the way they are as a leader in the work.

528
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,940
So it has so many other ripple effects.

529
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,079
Yeah, it's brilliant, isn't it?

530
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,299
As you said, lost their way

531
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,440
in the Western space so much.

532
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:03,099
I'm having spent,

533
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:04,980
lucky enough to spend some time out

534
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,420
on the Indigenous communities

535
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,079
and it's thousands of years old.

536
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,380
The secret men's business is really,

537
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,539
an amazing cultural thing

538
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,180
that we haven't really learned from

539
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,759
and it's the village raising the child

540
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,039
as we hear that term,

541
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,480
but we don't know how to do it anymore

542
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,000
and it feels like you're surrounded

543
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,819
by more people than ever,

544
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,619
but on your own more,

545
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
if that makes sense, isn't it?

546
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,480
It's such a brilliant thing

547
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,579
that you're championing again, Mim.

548
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,980
It's one of the great,

549
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,599
we talk about, Beck and I,

550
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,900
a lot about the outside role models

551
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
and trying to facilitate that,

552
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,839
but it's a lot of work

553
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,200
in trying to do that outside,

554
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,019
out of the family, isn't it?

555
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,720
It's not an easily accessible thing.

556
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,380
It's been lost.

557
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,839
So another great,

558
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,259
a great passion project.

559
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,039
Luke, I look forward to you doing it

560
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,420
and having a conversation with you after.

561
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,059
Yeah, that's right.

562
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,660
And you can always chat to Mike about it

563
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,200
or anyone,

564
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,099
bring up my husband,

565
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,900
have a chat about it

566
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,220
because some people feel a bit nervous about it,

567
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,019
but Mike's a pretty,

568
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:59,799
you know, mainstream type of guy

569
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,220
and he's done it with all our three boys

570
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,920
and just loved it.

571
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,660
So he's always welcome to talk to men

572
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,420
who are a little bit nervous about it.

573
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,339
And since you've mentioned,

574
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,579
there's a couple of friends of mine

575
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:07,420
who didn't know had done it

576
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,079
and who have done it

577
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,740
who share the same experience,

578
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,200
which is,

579
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,920
which is great.

580
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,579
So maybe practice on the older two.

581
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,900
The younger two are still in that zone

582
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,640
where I could maybe,

583
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,119
maybe get them up there.

584
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,700
I do want to keep moving through

585
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,920
because I love what you do

586
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,740
in which is,

587
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,099
you know,

588
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,180
create so many opportunities for change

589
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,019
in spaces that,

590
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,940
that you're passionate about

591
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,859
reading about a couple of others.

592
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,480
She,

593
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,259
EO,

594
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,900
addressing another huge problem,

595
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,259
isn't it?

596
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,259
That female founders,

597
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,579
I think reading some of your work,

598
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,500
only two and a half percent

599
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,460
of venture capital funds

600
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,779
go towards female founders

601
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:40,039
and,

602
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:40,740
and again,

603
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,799
you put your money,

604
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,400
your time,

605
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,900
your passion

606
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,160
and your intelligence

607
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,140
towards things that count.

608
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,660
How's that project unfolded?

609
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:49,259
Look,

610
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:49,779
that's great.

611
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm not,

612
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm not super involved

613
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,960
in it,

614
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:53,319
but it's,

615
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,640
I'm very honoured to be part of it.

616
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,400
And it's because of that statistics

617
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,940
that less than 2.5%

618
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,599
of venture capital funding

619
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,099
go to female led startups.

620
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,480
And it was created by Vicky Saunders,

621
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
who's an incredible Canadian,

622
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,579
super kind of moving shaker.

623
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,880
She,

624
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,920
wanted to right that kind of injustice.

625
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,099
And so it's a global movement.

626
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,119
And what's wonderful

627
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,279
is it is,

628
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,440
we're called activators.

629
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,579
We put in a thousand dollar

630
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,839
non-refundable loan

631
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,079
that goes into a pool

632
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,519
and female led ventures

633
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,240
that are making an impact

634
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,980
in terms of hitting

635
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,819
those sustainable development goals.

636
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,279
They apply for funding

637
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,900
and we vote on them as an activator.

638
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,420
Five,

639
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,140
there are five winners in Australia.

640
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,839
They get to take that money as a loan

641
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,140
and they get incredible support,

642
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
they get a huge connection.

643
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,940
They get mentoring for some,

644
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,740
from some really fabulous senior women.

645
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,740
And so it's an incredible community.

646
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,380
So it's women supporting women.

647
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,339
And we find out about these incredible businesses

648
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,140
that are actually having fantastic social impact.

649
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
And, and, you know,

650
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,440
if you don't have a thousand dollars,

651
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,539
you can put in,

652
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,240
get 10 friends and put in a hundred dollars each,

653
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,839
but you're part of this community.

654
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,339
They do incredible Zoom get togethers,

655
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,140
face, you know,

656
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,440
face to face get togethers.

657
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,539
There's so many different topics

658
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,440
that you can learn from and share with each other.

659
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
So once again,

660
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,940
it's creating community amongst women

661
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,240
and supporting other women.

662
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,440
It's, it's really a beautiful initiative.

663
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,150
As I said,

664
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,950
all of these feel like their own podcast

665
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,750
in their own right, ma'am.

666
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,250
I feel,

667
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,750
I recommend you.

668
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,950
Well, that's right.

669
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,250
Yeah, I will follow up

670
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,750
because they're incredible stories.

671
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:35,549
You know,

672
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,349
you've, you've supported the Man Cave

673
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,349
and Hunter Johnson's work,

674
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,250
the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.

675
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,450
But I wanted to touch,

676
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,750
you know,

677
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,950
again,

678
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,950
our conversations,

679
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,549
both of those,

680
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,450
to skim over them.

681
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,250
Doesn't seem to do it justice

682
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,650
in any way,

683
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,549
shape or form.

684
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:49,950
But Mental Walks,

685
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,049
I was looking at that.

686
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,549
That is another brilliant initiative.

687
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:53,750
And can you tell us a little bit

688
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,549
about what you're doing there?

689
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:55,750
Yeah, wonderful.

690
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,250
So that's,

691
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:56,950
once again,

692
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,049
that's also a bigger global movement

693
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,849
and the founders in Australia,

694
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:03,950
a Bobbi Marlab and Adina Jacobs,

695
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,349
and they're in Shanghai on a,

696
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:07,450
at a business conference.

697
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,750
And someone said to them,

698
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:08,849
hey,

699
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,150
there's a group of women,

700
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,349
you know,

701
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,349
mentoring,

702
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,250
walking for an hour,

703
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,450
you know,

704
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,049
tomorrow morning,

705
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,049
would you be interested?

706
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,349
And that's how they found out about it.

707
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,650
And basically,

708
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,849
we have some incredible mentors

709
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:20,650
across Australia.

710
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,849
We're in every capital city

711
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,950
and some regional spots as well.

712
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,750
And as a mentor,

713
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,549
you need to be,

714
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,849
you know,

715
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:26,849
asked to be part of it.

716
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:28,450
So there's Successful Women in Business,

717
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,349
Government,

718
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:31,349
and the Entrepreneurial World.

719
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:32,450
And as a mentee,

720
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,650
you pay $30.

721
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,650
We are a not-for-profit,

722
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,849
so it's covering the admin costs.

723
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,650
And you put your kind of burning question

724
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,349
in the website,

725
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:40,849
what you would love some guidance on,

726
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:43,750
whether it's confidence or networking

727
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,349
or managing

728
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:45,250
a difficult boss

729
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,250
or how to start up a new business

730
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,150
or how to move industries,

731
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,950
whatever it might be.

732
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,049
And we will match you with the best mentor

733
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,349
that we feel would support you

734
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,950
around that question.

735
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,150
We meet in Melbourne outside the NGV

736
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,150
around the TAN once a month

737
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,950
on a Friday morning,

738
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,750
7.15 a.m.

739
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,849
We generally get around 30-35 mentees

740
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:09,049
and we match one to three mentees

741
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,349
with a mentor.

742
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:11,950
And then we set off around the TAN

743
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,049
and it's like a group coaching session

744
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,049
where you ask insightful questions,

745
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,450
give some advice and suggestions

746
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,950
and then the bonds that the mentees create,

747
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,250
they often stay in touch with each other

748
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,950
and often returning mentees do come back often

749
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,049
and then we'll always pair them

750
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:30,950
with a different mentor.

751
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,250
So it's incredible networking

752
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,549
and incredible community once again.

753
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,650
It's so simple walking and talking.

754
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,650
And there are a lot of women

755
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,049
who don't have any networks

756
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:43,950
or don't have people to ask,

757
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,250
ideas and guidance.

758
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,049
What should I do?

759
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,049
How should I do this?

760
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,150
So it's once again a very simple

761
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,750
but really powerful initiative.

762
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,650
That's brilliant, Mim,

763
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,549
and I love it.

764
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,549
And as you know,

765
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,549
I've done a little bit of homework

766
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,349
from a mutual friend

767
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,549
and she said,

768
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,349
you know,

769
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,750
if you want to describe Mim,

770
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,650
she, you know,

771
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,950
her leadership is so incredible

772
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,450
that all of her work she does

773
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,349
is basically about

774
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:06,250
how can she contribute more

775
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,150
and, you know,

776
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,549
I often say to people doing interviews like this,

777
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:11,849
you actually reflect and go,

778
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,549
I need to lift my game seriously

779
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,150
because you set the benchmark so high.

780
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,650
But when you look at your passion for that,

781
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,250
I mean, people who live the way you do

782
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,049
feel as though that's what makes you tick.

783
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,349
And as I said,

784
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,549
there's so many great causes.

785
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,549
I mean, is that what really the essence

786
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,150
of what you're doing

787
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,450
is all about trying to support

788
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,950
these great community projects?

789
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,450
Yeah, absolutely.

790
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,950
And also living an integrated life around it, Luke.

791
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,750
So in the past,

792
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,049
I would never mix my personal and professional life.

793
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:43,450
But once I started,

794
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:44,150
to do it,

795
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,150
I saw that there are so many kind of win-wins.

796
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,750
A lot of my corporate executives

797
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,950
that I was working with,

798
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,250
they were looking for more purpose

799
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,950
and meaning in their lives.

800
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,650
And so when I started to share examples

801
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,849
of what I was doing,

802
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,750
kind of in the community,

803
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,250
they were really interested to learn more about it.

804
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,549
And so by combining those two parts of my life,

805
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,549
you know, it's been incredible

806
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:06,849
for the different not-for-profits

807
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:08,549
and community initiatives

808
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:09,549
I've been involved in

809
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,849
because I have more resources

810
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,349
and more money

811
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:13,349
and more kind of mental,

812
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,650
more resource or involved in those organizations.

813
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,450
And it's been great for my clients

814
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,150
because they now have more purpose and meaning.

815
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,849
They're giving back

816
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,250
and they're feeling more fulfilled

817
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,849
and they're connecting with more people.

818
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:29,349
And so it's had a lot of win-wins

819
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,950
just leveraging the different parts of my life

820
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,849
to kind of, to support the different,

821
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,349
to support the different parts of my life.

822
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:39,250
And I think it's a great segue, Mim,

823
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,849
because, you know,

824
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,250
what I wanted to touch on as well,

825
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,450
and maybe the greatest

826
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,349
achievement, you know,

827
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,849
I look at, you know,

828
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,950
your life and what you've done

829
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,049
is the fact you've been able to do that

830
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,450
and raise this incredible family.

831
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,950
And I've had the great pleasure of meeting Mike,

832
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,750
your husband, who is a legend

833
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,849
and brilliant in everything he does in his own right.

834
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,750
And Nick and Rich, the twin boys are, you know,

835
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,450
captain and vice captain of Melbourne Grammar.

836
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,150
They both have gone on to study at Cambridge.

837
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,750
Tom, the younger brother,

838
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,250
also captain of Melbourne Grammar,

839
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,049
studying at the University of Pennsylvania,

840
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,549
I think at the moment, if I've got that right.

841
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,349
I mean, for someone listening to that, Mim, you know,

842
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,250
there's so much going on in your world.

843
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,250
What's been the secret to be able to balance family life

844
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,250
and have these incredibly healthy

845
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,750
and successful high-achieving boys as well?

846
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,250
Oh, look, and Luke, I mean, you know,

847
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,950
regardless of their achievement,

848
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,250
like I don't want to kind of place too much with you.

849
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,650
They are really beautiful boys.

850
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,150
Look.

851
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,150
They're amazing achievements.

852
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,750
I mean, you have to, I mean,

853
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,750
you want everyone to follow passion, Mim,

854
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,450
but that is remarkable to have three boys

855
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,349
that have got the dedication to go and pursue further

856
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,349
studies overseas.

857
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,650
It's incredible, you know.

858
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,349
It's kind of heartbreaking too, Luke,

859
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:49,849
because I'm so happy they're following in their dreams,

860
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:52,650
but it's really hard as a mum and I'm sure you can imagine

861
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,349
if all your kids lived overseas.

862
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:55,250
Yeah.

863
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,650
But they are very fulfilled, which is fabulous,

864
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,849
which is part of the reason I'm expanding my business overseas.

865
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:06,049
Look, I think having a very supportive partner where,

866
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:08,150
you know, we've both kind of been able to pick up

867
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,349
the domestic and caring responsibilities together

868
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,250
and we've been on the same wavelength

869
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,049
around parenting.

870
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,950
We've had similar values around parenting

871
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,049
and it's been really important to Mike as well.

872
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,250
Certainly marrying Mike, who's 12 years older than me,

873
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,349
meant that he'd kind of, he worked at Morgan Stanley

874
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,849
kind of for 15 years globally and he worked,

875
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,750
you know, basically his ass off so hard.

876
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,349
So by the time he had kids, he had kids a bit later,

877
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,150
being a bit older than me, it meant that he could devote

878
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,750
more time to the kids.

879
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,349
I think his presence, you know, in the boy's life

880
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,049
has been really profound.

881
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,049
And he hadn't done any personal work,

882
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,250
any self-awareness work when I met him in Hong Kong

883
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,549
and I kind of brought him along on the journey

884
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,250
and he was so open, Luke, and that's just been terrific.

885
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,849
So he did a Gestalt therapy part-time course

886
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:00,049
when I was studying Gestalt therapy and he's done

887
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:03,349
all sorts of, you know, different personal awareness.

888
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,950
We've done therapy together and I think it's actually

889
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,849
really good to normalise that like it's,

890
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,950
we don't have to be in a bad place to do therapy.

891
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,049
It's like going to the gym, getting in-person training,

892
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:12,849
you don't have to be super-informed.

893
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,349
You just want to be, kind of, improve where you're already at

894
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:19,049
and I think, so that's why I like to kind of be open

895
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,549
that I do therapy and Mike and I have done therapy.

896
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,549
It's a great conversation, Mimi, because, you know,

897
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,150
I know you're a fan of the positive psychology world

898
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,549
as well with Martin Seligman put on the agenda,

899
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,549
but I'll go back, you know, to your own reference to sporting.

900
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,150
A reference was if you were going to see the club sports psychologist,

901
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,650
everyone would be like, jeez, he's in real trouble, you know.

902
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,549
He's breaking up with his marriage or his girlfriend

903
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,650
or, and that's been transcended so much more to,

904
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:44,650
that is a performance tool and, in fact,

905
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,650
probably the best place you can get going

906
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,450
because physically you can't improve, you know,

907
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,650
tiny percentages really, but emotionally and mentally

908
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,950
and the idea of, you know, being a really happy couple

909
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,549
but wanting to expand that makes sense, doesn't it?

910
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,650
That stigma was there for so long.

911
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,750
Oh, and look, I don't want to, I don't want to kind of sugarcoat,

912
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,849
like we've had issues like everybody.

913
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:04,250
Yeah.

914
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,549
So, I'm not saying like we're in a bad, you know,

915
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,549
we're in like in the depths of just about to separate,

916
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,549
but more just to kind of, if we wanted an external person

917
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:12,650
who, you know, is objective.

918
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:12,750
Yeah.

919
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,450
And, you know, can support us both and can hold that space

920
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,650
and that's, you know, they're, they're the experts.

921
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,049
So.

922
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:18,450
Yeah.

923
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,549
It is such a good thing to do.

924
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:21,049
Yeah, amazing.

925
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,450
I'm sort of a role model for our boys.

926
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,750
Yeah.

927
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,750
If they, you know, having anxiety or depression

928
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,250
or just want some, just want some support in their life

929
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,849
that they then can go off and see a therapist without any shame,

930
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,250
just wanting to improve themselves

931
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,150
because it means then they'll be, you know, more self-aware

932
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,549
and hopefully be a better partner and a better parent

933
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:40,750
if that's what they choose to be

934
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,650
and a better leader in whatever they do.

935
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:48,549
I mean, I feel compelled to tell Rich's story.

936
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,049
It's an incredible, and I know you're open to share it

937
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,349
as Rich has been as well.

938
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,950
And it's an amazing story.

939
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,049
As a 17-year-old, Rich stands in front of 800 people

940
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,349
at Melbourne Grammar, the whole school community

941
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,049
and comes out as an openly gay young man.

942
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,849
His twin brother is alongside of him

943
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:12,450
to a standing ovation in the end and he goes on to deliver,

944
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,650
deliver that speech around schools all around us.

945
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,849
I mean, I'm blown away by the leadership

946
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:22,150
and the courage of your young, young man at that stage.

947
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,750
I mean, it must have been an incredibly proud moment.

948
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,549
Yeah, look, it was kind of nail-bitingly

949
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,750
because I only found out that he was going to come out that way

950
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,049
by delivering a speech at the Pride Week service

951
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,750
that they had at Melbourne Grammar.

952
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,250
And I only found out the night before when my other,

953
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,750
his twin brother, Nick, our other, one of our other sons said,

954
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,450
you know, did you know that Rich is going to come out tomorrow?

955
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,650
I've just seen his, you know, his speech kind of printed out

956
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,349
on the computer, on the printer.

957
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:56,150
So I was so nervous because I didn't know how that would be received

958
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,250
because no one had been so openly kind of out at Melbourne Grammar.

959
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,450
I think that was part of Rich's, the premise behind his decision

960
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,650
to do it so publicly so that there would be kind of no shame

961
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,250
and it was okay to be, to be a gay man.

962
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,449
Yeah.

963
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,449
I mean, he was a gay, a gay boy at an all-boys school.

964
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,449
Yeah.

965
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,449
I think it, you know, at a mixed co-ed school, probably less stigma.

966
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,449
But that, that was really important for him.

967
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,449
And he, and he, you know, he, he was a great debater

968
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,449
and he loved public speaking and he, you know,

969
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,449
really wanted to take this message more broadly.

970
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,449
So just to make it easier for other kids to be more open

971
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,449
about who they are and their sexuality.

972
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,449
And a lot of kids would come up to him or contact him later at schools

973
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,250
and say, thank you so much for kind of just normalising that at my school.

974
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,250
It's an amazing effort.

975
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,250
It's just, you know, as I said, I, I can't imagine having the courage

976
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,250
at that age to, to, to, to blaze that trail.

977
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,250
It's, it's, it's such an amazing thing.

978
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,250
It's, you know, there is some, it's worth having a look at if you,

979
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,250
if you have.

980
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,250
And I love the fact that then to go around and understand

981
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,250
the standing ovations at schools all around the state.

982
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,250
I mean, that in itself again is, you know, what he has done

983
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,250
for, for so many people where, as you said, going through

984
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,250
that would have had enormous challenge.

985
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,250
And again, the stats for, for young people who are working out their sexuality,

986
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,250
it's horrific.

987
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,250
It's, it's, it's been a car crash really.

988
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,250
So it's an amazing legacy.

989
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,250
Is it, does he look back on it now and, and, and understand his own courage?

990
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,250
Is it, is it just?

991
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,250
I'm not sure.

992
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,250
He, he's now, he's now in, and, and look, and look, Luke,

993
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,250
to say that there are so many other young people doing that as well.

994
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,250
So there are so many great stories of young people owning their sexuality

995
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,250
in a more public way.

996
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,250
So Richie's one of many, but, but thank you.

997
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,250
Look, he's over in London now and he's doing some,

998
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,250
so he works full time.

999
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,250
I'm for corporate, excuse me, but he's working for an LGBTIQ

1000
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,250
not-for-profit over there, just like us, where he goes into corporates

1001
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,250
and schools to talk about sexuality and, and being gay

1002
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,250
and kind of what that means.

1003
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,250
And, and so he, you know, he's still really continuing that work

1004
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,250
and loving that work and writing articles for the Gay Times,

1005
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,250
which is a, an LGBTIQ news platform over there.

1006
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,250
And he's on the LGBTIQ International Committee at the corporate he works for.

1007
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,250
So he's very, he's, you know, still feels really strongly about that

1008
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,250
and talks about just, you know,

1009
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,250
he talks about just not wanting to have shame around who he is.

1010
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,250
And, and yeah, so yeah, no, we are proud.

1011
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,250
We, we love him very much.

1012
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,250
And his twin brother was instrumental in instigating the,

1013
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,250
the pride round as part of the first 18 footy community as well.

1014
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,250
And so the support and the, you know, even not being in touch,

1015
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,250
I remember that story just reverberating around the city

1016
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,250
as this incredible, you know, positive experience.

1017
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,250
So, you know, you can hear listening to you,

1018
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,250
you're not surprised that it took a family like yours

1019
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,250
to allow that space for someone to do something,

1020
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,250
you know, which we think probably, you know,

1021
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,250
all these things should have happened many years ago,

1022
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,250
but they haven't.

1023
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,250
It takes, you know, as I said, amazing leadership to, to get there.

1024
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,250
It's incredible.

1025
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,250
Thanks, Luke.

1026
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,250
Thanks, Luke.

1027
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,250
But the more we can just accept our kids, whatever they might be,

1028
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,250
whatever diversity they have, whether it's learning abilities

1029
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,250
or just anything just to love them for who they are.

1030
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,250
Because if you don't, then you set them forth in the world with,

1031
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,250
you know, a lot more insecurities and baggage.

1032
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,250
That we all need.

1033
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,250
Yep.

1034
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,250
It's the ultimate leadership, isn't it?

1035
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,250
Absolutely.

1036
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,250
To do that.

1037
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,250
I mean, there's so many questions and places to go,

1038
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,250
but fascinated given your passion for this space to get you,

1039
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,250
we see these dimensions of modern leadership appearing regularly

1040
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,250
in different shapes and sizes and different diversity as well.

1041
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,250
And we've been asking leaders these same questions,

1042
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,250
starting with self-leadership.

1043
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,250
I mean, we see that as being something that, you know,

1044
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,250
the leaders who are self-reflective are really conscious of.

1045
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,250
Does that term resonate with you?

1046
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,250
That's right.

1047
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,250
I love self-leadership.

1048
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,250
Leadership is like from an inside-out perspective.

1049
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,250
And so really acknowledging whether we have a title or status

1050
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,250
or platform as kind of a leader.

1051
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,250
We all are leaders in every part of our life.

1052
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,250
And I think the more intention or mindfulness that we can bring to that

1053
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,250
and think about how do we want to show up as a leader in our family

1054
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,250
and our friendships.

1055
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,250
How do we want to show up as a leadership group, community and professionally?

1056
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,250
Because then the impact will be more positive that we can have.

1057
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,250
I think we all underestimate our influence and impact.

1058
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,250
And so I think it's a really beautiful term.

1059
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,250
And it's becoming so much more commonplace, which is great.

1060
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:28,250
So people are stepping up more into their leadership without having to,

1061
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,250
as I said, kind of be anointed.

1062
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,250
Yeah, having a title isn't necessary anymore.

1063
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,250
And that ability to, as you said, to impact yourself first and others.

1064
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,250
You mentioned mindfulness.

1065
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,250
I know we share a passion for the meditation space as well.

1066
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,250
Is that part of your daily world?

1067
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Is that something that you still value?

1068
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,250
Yeah, it is.

1069
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,250
So when I was 16, mum and dad did TM.

1070
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,250
And so from quite an early age, they introduced us, which is quite,

1071
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,250
that's a long time ago now.

1072
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,250
So that's quite kind of, they were really at the forefront in terms

1073
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,250
of their community around that.

1074
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,250
So that's early 80s, was it?

1075
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
Yeah, no.

1076
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,250
Yeah.

1077
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,250
Yeah.

1078
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,250
For Transcendental Meditation, you know,

1079
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,250
Melbourne in that period of time was,

1080
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,250
and that's the same practice that I've used for over 20 years as well,

1081
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,250
as it turns out.

1082
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,250
Mantra-based meditation, for those that aren't listening,

1083
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,250
it's a word that doesn't have a specific meaning,

1084
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,250
but there's a lot of independent studies published on the research around,

1085
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,250
you know, what that does.

1086
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,250
And so you learnt that through your parents at a young age?

1087
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,250
Yeah.

1088
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,250
Yeah.

1089
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,250
Yeah.

1090
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Yeah.

1091
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,250
So that's a good thing.

1092
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,250
Yeah.

1093
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,250
And I've done some courses over the years.

1094
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,250
And now, so I try, you know, I'd say I'm about a five dayer.

1095
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,250
Yeah.

1096
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,250
And I do it, I do it where I can in the afternoon,

1097
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,250
which is my kind of more sleepier time, low energy.

1098
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,250
And I find that it gives me energy as well as perspective.

1099
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,250
And I'm quite a hyper person.

1100
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,250
So it's actually really good just to kind of calm me.

1101
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,250
So I find it hugely beneficial.

1102
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,250
I love it.

1103
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,250
Yeah.

1104
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,250
And I actually, whenever I start a coaching session or a group session,

1105
00:39:51,250 --> 00:40:04,250
or even like a team, they have three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1106
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,570
a team, they have three, four hundred people, will always start with a couple of minutes

1107
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,570
of mindfulness.

1108
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,090
And even a couple of minutes, like people who just are so resistant to this, just can't

1109
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,010
believe the difference a couple of minutes can make.

1110
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,010
Yeah.

1111
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,010
It's incredible, isn't it?

1112
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,489
I mean, I was, you know, for a long period of time, it was pretty out there in the late

1113
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:28,010
nineties in the Western suburbs of Melbourne for an AFL team to have access to that.

1114
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,329
And, you know, it just stuck with me because you're routine based and I didn't quite realise

1115
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,230
how beneficial it was.

1116
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,070
And a lot of people, oh mate, golf is my meditation or riding a bike's my meditation.

1117
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,590
And I said, you know, great pursuits and very worthwhile and I need to play more golf and

1118
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,590
go for a run more.

1119
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,590
But this is in a different bracket.

1120
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,590
This is in a different category.

1121
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,550
And I love now that it is a much more open space, isn't it?

1122
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,630
From guided meditation as to whether you want to learn mantra based, but to have that account

1123
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,230
open, we're not saying it's for everyone, but the benefits are enormous.

1124
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,550
If you can slow down your nervous system a couple of times a day, it's incredibly powerful.

1125
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:09,789
I've been blessed to have that in my life as well.

1126
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:13,710
And I feel like one more thing, I think it's great.

1127
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,550
So you know, just to kind of broaden the scope, just for your listeners, I think to introduce

1128
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:22,829
your kids to this at a young age, and I was talking to my brother about this recently,

1129
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:26,909
even if you just like lie on the bed with them, you know, when they're young and you

1130
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:31,190
just do five minutes of like a beautiful guided meditation for kids, there are so many meditations

1131
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,909
available to instil that practice in your body.

1132
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:38,269
That practice in your kids is so important because, you know, kids face a lot of challenges

1133
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,269
as they grow up.

1134
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:44,250
And so for them to have that kind of bedrock of somewhere that they can go to will support

1135
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,630
them in their mental health and stress as they have.

1136
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,230
The younger we are, the easier we'll adopt that practice.

1137
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,030
I think it's great to start early.

1138
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,030
Yeah, beautifully said.

1139
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,030
I couldn't agree more.

1140
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,070
And, you know, part of the passion I've had is to try and actually, you know, spread that

1141
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,070
knowledge.

1142
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,150
There's some great awareness now, but literally, you know, in our house.

1143
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,750
Yeah.

1144
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,349
We, we, we sort of legislated that they were going to learn and there was a few eye rolls

1145
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:08,349
as you'd imagine.

1146
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:12,789
We used to bribe them on a Sunday night, you know, Uber Eats, if you, we do a family meditation

1147
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:16,789
and there was, you know, as long as you don't tell any of our friends, but I've watched

1148
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:22,469
them all over time when there's important things going on, they have got a space to

1149
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:26,750
go to that's interesting that they can use and can self-regulate.

1150
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,909
And it's, it's just part of who they are now and, and it's a, it's a brilliant tool and

1151
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:33,469
we know just how powerful it is.

1152
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:34,469
So.

1153
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,469
That's great.

1154
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,469
Look, I love that story.

1155
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:39,409
We need to keep, keep spreading the message.

1156
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:44,230
We see leaders, Mim, like you're really conscious of how they positively impact others in their

1157
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,230
environment.

1158
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,869
Your life, every bit of it is about positive impact.

1159
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,150
Have you been really conscious about that?

1160
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:55,630
Yeah, I really think regularly about, you know, the difference I'm making.

1161
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,349
What can I, you know, how can I kind of dial it up or what can I do differently?

1162
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:01,710
My mum, who is, you know.

1163
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,349
One of the rocks of my life and incredible woman.

1164
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:10,530
She died of a heart attack, you know, fit as a fiddle on a morning walk at 62.

1165
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,030
And so I've, I've kind of got this thing that I could like just any moment I could die.

1166
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,030
Yeah.

1167
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,289
And so like, just what can I do now?

1168
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:24,030
How can I live my best life now and to make the most of, of every moment.

1169
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,469
So that, that's kind of my attitude.

1170
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,469
Yeah.

1171
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:27,469
It's brilliant.

1172
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:29,030
It's a, it's a great reminder, isn't it?

1173
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,949
That all those things that we're delaying and worried about and the stress.

1174
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:31,469
Yeah.

1175
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:36,969
It's, um, I think that's been brought to reality in recent times.

1176
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:40,289
We've had some really high profile people, you know, Shane Warnes brings to mind and

1177
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:44,070
others that, you know, in the prime of their life in their early fifties, a lot of males

1178
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:49,510
have, uh, have had exactly that, you know, experience, which I know was tragic losing

1179
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,369
your mum in that circumstances.

1180
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,710
It's brilliant to bring back straight away, isn't it?

1181
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,429
To, you know, what's happening now that we can, we can improve.

1182
00:43:56,429 --> 00:44:00,789
It's a, it's a great thing to share, uh, creating and sharing your vision is something that

1183
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:05,650
we see, uh, modern leaders are really, uh, very good at and conscious of, Mim, and I,

1184
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,869
you know, you only have to look up Mim Bartlett, uh, consulting to have a look at how clear

1185
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,809
your vision is, how clear the language is.

1186
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,670
Is that been something you've really been thoughtful on?

1187
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,670
Yeah.

1188
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,250
Well, working in this space, it's kind of forced me to think about, you know, if I'm

1189
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,010
working with executives around what's their vision and what's their legacy and how do

1190
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,610
they want to make an impact and step more into their influence to have more of an impact,

1191
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,670
then, you know, I've got to be really clear.

1192
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,369
And so I, you know, do quite a lot of personal professional development courses to keep

1193
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:40,250
kind of me on my toes and making sure that I'm doing the work because it's, it's, it's

1194
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,869
so much easier and I, I feel nicer to kind of be guided by someone else around my process

1195
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:47,630
and also to learn from others.

1196
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:52,590
So I try to do that just to keep learning and growing myself and to kind of, yeah, keep

1197
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:57,989
challenging myself and not just holding space and supporting and challenging others.

1198
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:59,989
And I should jump in and say, uh, uh, appreciative of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1199
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,510
well, I'm so appreciative of, uh, you've invited Matt, uh, who's my, uh, my great friend

1200
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,429
and partner in the, in the world of a leader to, uh, to take your change up, uh, uh, course.

1201
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,570
So I'm, we're really excited about the opportunity to, um, to learn from you, which we're doing,

1202
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,329
uh, today as well.

1203
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:19,369
We, we see leaders, uh, curiosity is a really common trait that we're seeing that, that

1204
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:23,369
the, the great leaders that we're talking to a lot are really curious and they approach

1205
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:25,929
their learning and, and development through that lens.

1206
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,769
Does that, does that resonate with you as well?

1207
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:28,989
Yeah, absolutely.

1208
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,909
So, yeah, I mean, one, I want to kind of make sure I've got like the cutting edge research

1209
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:39,389
and best practice around psychology and mindfulness-based behavioral therapies and leadership in my

1210
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:43,309
work, but also for me, because I want to keep growing and learning.

1211
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:47,409
And look, I think I have, you know, dad really to thank for that.

1212
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:51,210
He started, you know, Norman Vincent Peale kind of, you know, it's very different to

1213
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,510
kind of now, but, you know, positive kind of thinking and things, you know, when I was

1214
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,050
very young.

1215
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,170
So he was always on the self-help kind of improvement.

1216
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,170
So as a young person, you know, that really was a great motivator for me.

1217
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,989
And so, you know, I'm always wanting to kind of learn and grow and, yeah, see how I can

1218
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:09,329
improve in different ways.

1219
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,849
You can see the pieces coming, you know, learning Transcendental Meditation in your

1220
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:16,650
teenage years and having those influences and the influence of your mum.

1221
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:22,590
It sort of makes sense how you've unfolded in all the incredible work that you've done

1222
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,369
with so many people.

1223
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,150
I mean, communicating with clarity is another dimension I wanted to ask you about as

1224
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,090
someone who's clearly an amazing communicator.

1225
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,949
Have you been strategic in how you've communicated your message?

1226
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,110
Well, I hope so, Luke.

1227
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,010
It's working well.

1228
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:41,449
I hope so.

1229
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:41,969
Yeah.

1230
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,969
Have you thought about it?

1231
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,929
I mean, debating was a passion and the fact you can, I mean, I'm blown away by the fact

1232
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,570
you take on Chinese and speak fluent Chinese as well.

1233
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:55,349
So clearly you're open to learning, you know, different ways to communicate as well.

1234
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,429
It's clearly a strength.

1235
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:57,949
Oh, that's kind of, look, look.

1236
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:03,769
Yeah, debating and public speaking when I was young and at school and then also kind

1237
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:07,829
of more recently post that, you know, Woman of Influence Award, I started to do some

1238
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:12,670
keynote speaking around stepping more into your impact and influence around leadership.

1239
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:18,809
And so, yeah, I have been quite thoughtful about it and I've worked with different

1240
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:22,170
communications people to kind of help me in that area.

1241
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,829
And then it's also really handy too when I've got three young men to kind of,

1242
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,989
you know, argue and debate against whatever it might be.

1243
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,570
I've got to be very on my toes.

1244
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,309
That would be an interesting dinner party.

1245
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,710
I think the boys would hold their own pretty well from...

1246
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,710
Oh my God, Luke, it's exhausting.

1247
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,269
You told me you got a bit of feedback from one on the way in here today, which I love

1248
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:41,690
as well.

1249
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:47,389
Collaboration, we see leaders are really acutely aware of collaboration as a real strength

1250
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:49,269
and something that they seek out.

1251
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,909
Has that been a big part of the way you've gone about your leadership?

1252
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:53,809
Yeah.

1253
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,889
So, absolutely.

1254
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:57,690
So, certainly with the social justice.

1255
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:04,829
Social impact work I've done, always trying to kind of galvanise my community around the

1256
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:09,349
different kind of not-for-profits and issues, causes that I'm working with so that they

1257
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:13,570
then can, if they're interested and it resonates with them so that they can use their influence

1258
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,949
and mobilise their resources and networks around and step up if it interests them to

1259
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:18,789
push it forward.

1260
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:25,150
So, very much in my social justice space and certainly around my professional life, I've

1261
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,070
had different collaborations with different people.

1262
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:27,869
For me, there's...

1263
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:32,630
There's benefits of having the autonomy and kind of just doing it kind of the way I want

1264
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,750
to do it and also having flexibility around that has been really important.

1265
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,349
But I also do love working with other people and learning from them.

1266
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:45,170
And, you know, you feel less lonely kind of in your work when you've got someone to and

1267
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,210
others to bounce ideas off.

1268
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:48,190
It's really lovely.

1269
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,010
Yeah, beautifully said.

1270
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,469
I've been asking these two questions, Mim, of all the ladies.

1271
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,329
I've had this great privilege of sitting alongside and I've loved catching up with you today.

1272
00:48:57,329 --> 00:48:59,369
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1273
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:01,670
Yeah, it's a really good question.

1274
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:11,090
I'd say my mum around love and generosity and energy and zest that she'd bring to every

1275
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:11,789
situation.

1276
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:18,570
And then actually more kind of a little bit further afield, but Gloria Steinem, an incredible

1277
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,789
feminist in America, the way she mobilised women and kind of empowered them to step up

1278
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:26,909
and stand up for what they're worth.

1279
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:27,630
And I think that's something that's really important for us to be able to do and to

1280
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,329
believe in themselves and a whole lot more is absolutely one of my role models too.

1281
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,949
It feels like you're passing that on in all of the work that you're doing.

1282
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,550
Is that inspiration from there?

1283
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:44,090
I'm trying one step at a time, but there's some incredible women who have gone before

1284
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,849
us and I feel so grateful for them.

1285
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,710
I'm just, I'm like a drop in the ocean.

1286
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:52,489
So many people have just done incredible things and I love being inspired by them.

1287
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,449
Yeah, and it's brilliant.

1288
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:57,150
You know, whenever I have these conversations with you and people,

1289
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:01,170
you know, think about being a father of a teenage daughter and not really knowing where

1290
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,349
to go a lot of the time.

1291
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:06,550
And so, you know, when there are people out there leading the way you are, it's the great

1292
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,869
resources.

1293
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,949
It's, you're fumbling your way through.

1294
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,710
I'm sure I'd get that feedback from her if she was here.

1295
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:19,469
In terms of collaboration, in the spirit of collaboration, is there anyone in any of your

1296
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:23,750
varied and brilliant work that you've thought, if I could collaborate with that person, anyone

1297
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,489
in the world on any issue, is there anyone that springs to mind?

1298
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,929
Wow, that's a great question, Luke.

1299
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,530
Well, probably someone like Gloria Steinem, because she's such a big visionary and she's,

1300
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:42,010
and the impact that she's had just in so many areas of her life, but on such a big scale,

1301
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,510
that would be amazing.

1302
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,809
I went and heard her speak when she came to the Melbourne Town Hall and

1303
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:49,849
Mai came with me and I mean, it was just incredible.

1304
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,989
So yeah, that would be amazing.

1305
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,170
I'm sure she'd feel exactly the same, Mim.

1306
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,010
It would be a great collaboration.

1307
00:50:57,469 --> 00:51:01,929
And once again, I thank you for your time, but also extending the opportunity for us

1308
