1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
I guess when you come in as a young kid and your father's playing cricket

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,580
for Australia and your brother's currently playing cricket for Australia,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,320
there's a lot of expectation externally.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,560
But my dad's just my dad, you know, and my brother's my brother

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,759
and my sister's my sister.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,879
That's all I see them as.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,300
And I often joke with dad that if I can't sleep at night,

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,420
I just put on his highlights and I fall straight to sleep.

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,039
So there's plenty of banter within the family.

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,399
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Mitch Marsh,

11
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,799
the most recent Allen Border medalist and the current T20 captain

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,659
of Australia heading into the World Cup.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,460
Mitch has got some great stories.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,520
I know you're going to enjoy them.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,219
He referenced a meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson at the Ashes in 2023

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,140
and some direct advice he got from the legendary Manchester United manager.

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,780
He also spoke of another encounter as a 17-year-old aspiring young AFL player

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,020
and being at the Australian Open.

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,000
The Australian Institute of Sport having a coffee with AFL legend Nathan Buckley

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
and getting some unique advice from Bucks as well.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,540
You want to hear more of that story.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,420
Mitch's path to being his true authentic self and how that has provided him

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,640
with the happiest and most successful period of his sporting life

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,560
and his life in general is a great story worth listening to.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,640
We're really privileged to have Mitch Marsh as part of our Elite Connect program

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,340

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,019
Mitch.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,620
Mitch is a great champion of our Elite Connect space.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,180
He's a lifelong learner and it's something that we are really proud of at Alita

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Big thanks as always to the team at Tempa, to Jason Nicholas from Tempa Australia

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,000
and their great support of bringing conversations like this to fruition.

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,540
We really appreciate their ongoing support.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,060
Investing in a mattress from Tempa is a decision you won't regret.

38
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,760
Mitch Marsh in 2023.

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,099
2023 was awarded Australian Cricket's most prestigious prize,

40
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,420
the Alan Borda Medal, recognising him as the most outstanding cricketer of the year.

41
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,719
Mitch has represented his country in 41 tests, 89 one-day internationals,

42
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,199
50-40-20 internationals and the Marsh family are sporting royalty in Australia.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,340
His dad, Jeff, and brother, Sean, both played more than 100 internationals for Australia

44
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,139
and his sister, Melissa, is a Western Australian Basketball Hall of Fame.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Mitch, it's great to see you. How are you?

46
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,319
Yeah, very well, Darce. Thanks for having me on here.

47
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,939
Well, congratulations, mate. It's been an unbelievably successful time.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,819
You're part of the team that retained the Ashes.

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,020
You won the one-day International World Cup in India in the most incredible style,

50
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,539
one of the great sporting wins in recent history, the World Test Championship.

51
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,860
And in that time, as I said, you were the Alan Borda medalist.

52
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,699
You must be really proud.

53
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,840
Yeah, it's certainly been an incredible, I guess, couple of years for this team.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,919
We're very lucky.

55
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,939
We've got a lot of experienced players that have played a lot of cricket for Australia.

56
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,599
And I think the last 18 months with the trophies,

57
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,419
that we've won, it's all accumulated into that.

58
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,759
And it's been a real pleasure to be a part of it.

59
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,439
And Mitch, one of my favourite quotes, and I wanted to run this past you,

60
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,599
Oscar Wilde said, be yourself, everyone else is already taken.

61
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,500
And when I look at you, that's exactly what I think of someone who's absolutely themselves.

62
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,800
I want to play back a little bit of your speech from the Alan Borda medal night.

63
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,099
Have a listen to this.

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,740
I'd like to pay a particular thank you to Ronnie and Paddy.

65
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,729
You just...

66
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,270
You believed in me.

67
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,150
And I don't really know.

68
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,530
I can't thank you enough for just believing in me.

69
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,270
I'm a bit fat at times and I love a beer, but...

70
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:49,189
But you see the best in me always.

71
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,189
And you just...

72
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,689
Yeah, you've changed my life.

73
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,770
So for your support, Paddy, and your leadership, playing under you is an absolute dream.

74
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,770
So, yeah, thank you very much.

75
00:03:58,889 --> 00:03:59,930
It was beautiful to me.

76
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,689
There were tears, there were humour.

77
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,069
And as I said, you've just been authentically you.

78
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,409
Have you always been that comfortable?

79
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,030
Your own skin?

80
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,490
Absolutely not, is the truthful answer to that.

81
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,969
I think it certainly took me a while to, I guess, find my feet,

82
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,370
playing cricket at the highest level from a young age,

83
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,569
being on a little bit of a journey as to finding out who I am as a person

84
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,089
and being able to separate that person as a cricketer.

85
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,970
And I think the last probably 18 months, those two have come together

86
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,490
and I've had my best probably two years of cricket

87
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,850
and most certainly the best two years of my life.

88
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:34,970
That's just a brilliant...

89
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,569
That's a brilliant thing that I want to ask you more about, isn't it?

90
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,250
That often we're trying to be something that we're not

91
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,850
and then you're always probably living an uncomfortable life there.

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,089
Can you describe more of that?

93
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,430
Did you feel like you had to be a certain type of person

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,569
and now that you are the relaxed, chilled, authentic cat

95
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,290
that you probably always have been, that that's been the happiest time?

96
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,209
I've certainly been the best version of myself and I've grown into that.

97
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,769
But as a young kid and I feel like a lot of young athletes

98
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,029
and what people in general go down this road,

99
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,589
but when I first started playing cricket,

100
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,149
when cricket was going well, I was the king.

101
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,430
And when it wasn't going well, I was not down in the dumps,

102
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,110
but I really battled and a lot of that came with, I guess,

103
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,529
not being able to deal with failure

104
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,329
and understanding what failure looks like for me

105
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,810
and how I get better in those situations.

106
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,589
And there's certainly times I would get into a bit of a rut

107
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,149
and I'd do a lot of work on the mental side of my game

108
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,589
to get to a point where I was not necessarily okay with failure,

109
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,009
but understanding that I'm going to fail.

110
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,529
Working out ways to prepare as best as I possibly can

111
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,149
to give myself the opportunity for a great outcome.

112
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,589
And if that doesn't happen, then end of the game,

113
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,569
I can look myself in the mirror and say,

114
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,209
well, I've done everything I can and that's okay.

115
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,370
And I think detaching myself from the outcome

116
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,149
allowed me to review better, to move on to the next game

117
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,029
or to the next ball.

118
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,470
And yeah, it's been a really cool journey.

119
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:00,050
Yeah, I'm curious about more of that.

120
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,990
As you said, if we're all outcome focused

121
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,350
and make 100 and life's great,

122
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,089
then you're going to fall into a hole.

123
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,629
How did you get the skill set to do that?

124
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,529
Did you seek out some professional help with that to, as you said,

125
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,050
let the outcome sort itself out?

126
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:17,189
I'll just go and be the best I can be.

127
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,769
Is there anyone that helped you in that space?

128
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,529
Yeah, I had some great people in my corner.

129
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:26,509
I think every young kid who starts playing for Australia,

130
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,089
you've all got a dream that you're going to finish your career

131
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,870
averaging 50 with 25 test hundreds.

132
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,949
And for me, maybe 100 wickets, although bowling's too hard.

133
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:39,509
And when it doesn't pan out that straight away,

134
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,589
I didn't necessarily know how to deal with that.

135
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,490
So as I said before, I had some great people in my corner,

136
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,550
Maddy Bergen, Michael Lloyd,

137
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,290
two great psychologists that worked for Cricket Australia

138
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,850
and WA Cricket at the time,

139
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,949
helped me a lot with, I guess, detaching myself from the outcome

140
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,850
and not letting cricket define me as a human being.

141
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,949
I guess going through that journey of preparing as well as I can

142
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,069
for every game, trying to get better,

143
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,009
trying to keep improving,

144
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:09,050
but understanding that if I fail, I can still be a great husband,

145
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,389
I can still be a good family man,

146
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,269
and not letting that eat away at me.

147
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,189
And I think I've found that really nice balance now

148
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,050
over the last couple of years where I still love competing,

149
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,449
I still love winning games for Cricket for Australia

150
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,769
and Western Australia when I'm there.

151
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,649
But ultimately, the most important thing for me

152
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,389
is being a good husband, looking after my family

153
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,529
and enjoying, I guess, the fruits of the labour outside of cricket

154
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,470
and, yeah, enjoying life.

155
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,509
Just a smile for me to hear, Mitch,

156
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,069
you're around and you've become that person in Australian sport

157
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,970
where you want to be around and be like Mitch Marsh

158
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,230
and it's incredible.

159
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,730
It's great to see and you look at spending four years

160
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,170
out of the test side and that must have been incredibly challenging

161
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,769
because I'm sure deep down you thought,

162
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,670
I know I'm good enough, I know if they give me another opportunity.

163
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,430
Can you tell us about how challenging that time was?

164
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,910
Yeah, I mean, it was, I think at the time when I was dropped

165
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,649
and I was out of the team, it was probably the best thing for me

166
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,470
at the time.

167
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,129
You're almost at a point where I'd failed so much as a test batsman

168
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,069
that I knew it was time for me to, I guess, reset

169
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,410
and try and start the journey of getting back.

170
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,930
I didn't think it would take me four years, but it did.

171
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,970
So it was a long time and I'd be lying if I said there was times

172
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,949
where I thought I was done and I actually got to a point

173
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,810
where I accepted that I was probably never going to play

174
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,730
test match cricket again.

175
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:30,529
And in a way, that probably helped me really start to enjoy

176
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,789
my cricket again and there wasn't this element of waking up every day,

177
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,470
just trying to chase something that was probably out of my reach

178
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,490
at certain times.

179
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,169
So, yeah, it's been an incredible journey to just get that one more crack

180
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,889
at it, which I said to a few people in my close circle that I was okay

181
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,590
if I never played again, but gee, I just wanted to have one more crack

182
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,309
at it and, yeah, I guess the last nine tests have been thoroughly enjoyable

183
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,690
and I certainly don't take any of them for granted now.

184
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,950
And now I'm sitting here talking to Mitch Marsh, the Ellen Borda medalist,

185
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,570
alongside the all-time greats of the game.

186
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,590
We've won that prestigious award and recently announced

187
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,110
the ICC T20 World Cup captain for Australia.

188
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,990
I mean, it's an amazing, isn't it, trajectory to go through,

189
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,870
maybe thinking that you'd never play test match cricket again

190
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,970
for Australia and now you're sitting here as the captain.

191
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:23,870
Congratulations.

192
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,429
You must, again, feel really proud.

193
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,230
Oh, immensely proud.

194
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,730
You know, the opportunity to captain Australia at a World Cup

195
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,669
is something that I never thought I'd do.

196
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,370
I'm very, extremely grateful for the people that we've got around us

197
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,509
in the team at the moment and some of the other leaders within our group

198
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,649
that will hopefully make the job easy.

199
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,009
It's not always going to be easy, but I've got some great people around me

200
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,850
and I dare say I've probably been a reluctant captain at times

201
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,330
because I just love playing and getting around the lads,

202
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:54,110
but I think my style and who I am as a person, yeah,

203
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,590
I feel really comfortable that I'm going to be able to lead the group

204
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,110
my way and be myself and that's one of the biggest things

205
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,970
I've learned about leadership.

206
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,649
And Mitch, you referenced,

207
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,029
Pat Cummings in your Alan Bordermedal speech

208
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,889
and the influence that he's had on you.

209
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,669
And again, I love that you're now saying,

210
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,789
I feel comfortable because I'm comfortable in who I am.

211
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,690
Can you tell us about Pat's influence on you and your style as a captain?

212
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:19,370
Yeah, look, well, Paddy and I go back a long way now.

213
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,169
We first toured, our first tour was together.

214
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,909
I was 19.

215
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,830
Paddy was about 12 at that time.

216
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,549
It feels like that anyway.

217
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,330
In South Africa?

218
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:31,830
In South Africa, yeah.

219
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,070
Yeah.

220
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,769
And we instantly became great friends

221
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,950
and I've watched Paddy's journey as a leader

222
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,610
over the last couple of years very closely

223
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,870
and just so proud of the way he's gone about it.

224
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,850
And he's taught me probably the most about staying true to yourself

225
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,850
and your values and staying the course as a leader.

226
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,529
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to working closely with him.

227
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,129
We're great mates and, yeah, as I said,

228
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,490
we've got a lot of great leaders within our team that, yeah,

229
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,210
make it a lot of fun.

230
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,549
And Mitch, we've been incredibly privileged to collaborate with you

231
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:01,970
in a space that we call,

232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,669
Leader and our Leader Connect program.

233
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,690
We curate groups of five to six people often around the country

234
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,950
or even around the globe.

235
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,929
And you've got a really fascinating group of other sporting legends.

236
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,289
Paddy Cripps is in your group of Brownlow medalists

237
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,009
from Carlton.

238
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,389
The daily Cherry Evans is a superstar of the NRL,

239
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:21,929
Jeeva Mentor, world-class in her field test match

240
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:22,750
in the Australian Basketball.

241
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,230
Captain, can you tell us a bit about what that's been like

242
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,649
sitting amongst that group on a monthly basis?

243
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,950
It was something that Pat had done.

244
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:31,929
He had a few groups.

245
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,049
And he mentioned that it would be worthwhile me getting stuck in

246
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:36,870
and getting involved.

247
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,669
And I've had the best time.

248
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,389
It's, yeah, a great group of people that I was involved with.

249
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,909
You know, it probably took us two sessions to really open up

250
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,850
and get to know each other.

251
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,470
And then what I love most about it is I formed a real connection

252
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,809
with the group to the point now where you just bounce ideas

253
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,549
off each other and learn.

254
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,429
And, yeah, it's something that I look forward to.

255
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,889
Every session has got better and better.

256
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,350
And I've just had the best time.

257
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,269
I understand that, again, you're that great connector.

258
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:08,950
I think you've been authentically you as just something that pours out.

259
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,269
Is that even in a group that you perhaps hadn't had the experience

260
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,590
with before, do you find it easy again to sort of show up

261
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,090
and share the way that you do?

262
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,149
The whole connection piece is a really important thing for me

263
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,850
in anything I do in my life.

264
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,409
You know, my family, my friends, my teams, and now my leader crew.

265
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,070
And, yeah, I certainly opened up as we went along.

266
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,870
Yeah, the few little gaps.

267
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,830
And I got a few laughs every now and then, which is good.

268
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,350
Stace is always my number one.

269
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,730
She gave me a few laughs, which is good.

270
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,009
But, yeah, just got a real connection.

271
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,350
And, look, that crew now, I'll catch up with them forever,

272
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,090
wherever I'm in Sydney or Melbourne or now England for Jiva.

273
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:48,870
Yeah, I've got some great friends there.

274
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,750
Mitch, you've grown up in an era as a professional athlete where the world

275
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,870
of social media provides incredible opportunities and also incredible

276
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,649
challenges at the same time.

277
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,009
How have you navigated?

278
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,450
How have you navigated that and handled it?

279
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,070
It feels like an issue that every young kid's dealing with and you're

280
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,009
about to be a parent yourself.

281
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,029
Is it something that you've got to handle on and can you describe

282
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:11,990
how you've thought about it?

283
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,110
I mean, yeah, as a young kid, it was something that I battled with.

284
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,669
I took a lot of it personally.

285
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:23,330
And at times I took that out in the field with me, the fact that I wanted

286
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,250
to prove people wrong.

287
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,529
And that mentality works for some people, but I realised that it didn't

288
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,870
work for me and it took me away from what I was actually good at.

289
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,570
And it took me away from actually just competing on the field.

290
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,269
And that's when I play my best cricket.

291
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,529
So I've learned not to take that personally.

292
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,190
I respect that in the world of social media, everyone's got an opinion

293
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,669
and they're allowed for that.

294
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,009
Some go overboard and there's a lot of people out there that deal

295
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,970
with worse than me.

296
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,289
But I get a lot of love these days, which is also nice.

297
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,830
I did not see the hard yards.

298
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:56,450
That's the story of your life, Mitch, isn't it?

299
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:57,990
You've battled through.

300
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,629
I understand you had a great gatekeeper, your sister, Melissa.

301
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,129
You used to fire back on behalf of the Marsh family from time to time.

302
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:05,529
Is that true?

303
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,090
I said in my Alan Bordermill speech that if anyone's ever abused me

304
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,450
on social media, that my sister will find them eventually and get them.

305
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,529
So she's a very protective sister.

306
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:19,669
And, yeah, we've got a great relationship.

307
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,950
Can you tell us a bit about growing up in the Marsh family?

308
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,570
I grew up when your dad was the opening batsman for Australia

309
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,570
and we idolised him and what a legend he was.

310
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,429
And Sean had such an incredible career.

311
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,309
I mentioned your sister's sporting exploits.

312
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,929
And I love it when you're out there in the middle and we pan back

313
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,970
and you might see dad having a beer and Sean's next to him.

314
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,009
And can you tell us a bit, did you initially feel the pressure of all that

315
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,049
or just the support overwhelms any of the pressure?

316
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,049
Yeah, I just had incredible support.

317
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:56,309
I think all of the pressure came externally and that's a given, I guess,

318
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,409
when you come in as a young kid and your father's played cricket,

319
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,129
played cricket for Australia and your brother's currently playing cricket

320
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,389
for Australia, there's a lot of expectation externally.

321
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,629
But my dad's just my dad, you know, and my brother's my brother

322
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,830
and my sister's my sister.

323
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:12,950
That's all I see them as.

324
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,370
And I often joke with dad that if I can't sleep at night,

325
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,509
I just put on his highlights and I fall straight to sleep.

326
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:23,529
So there's plenty of banter within the family.

327
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:26,529
I love it.

328
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,450
One of the all-time greats, Geoff Martian.

329
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:32,850
Maybe not as free-flowing as his youngest son.

330
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,149
Certainly not.

331
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:41,190
Mitch, I remember meeting you as a 17-year-old and you were a big full forward

332
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,190
for Western Australia, potentially going to play for Australia

333
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,090
at under-18 level.

334
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,909
You were a WA State player as an AFL and you were a big bison

335
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,149
even as a 17-year-old.

336
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:56,389
Was there any chance that AFL football was going to take you hard

337
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,710
or was cricket always going to win?

338
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:58,950
Oh, gee.

339
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,929
I loved footy.

340
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,549
And like most kids, I played cricket in the summer and footy in the winter

341
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:09,409
and I played the State under-16s and then I was a bottom age at 18s.

342
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,590
So I still had another year until I sort of had to make that decision,

343
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:13,830
re-footy.

344
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,769
But I think deep down it was always cricket.

345
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:23,450
I remember going to the AIS for a camp and Nathan Buckley was one of my mentors

346
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,710
and I had a typical cricketer's body.

347
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:27,529
I was a bit sloppy.

348
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:28,490
Yeah.

349
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,789
His kids at the time were getting ready to be drafted.

350
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,149
They'd done a full pre-season.

351
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,990
They're ready to go.

352
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,309
Buck sat me down at the cafeteria at AIS and he said,

353
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:39,730
do you like chocolate?

354
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,789
And clearly baited me and I didn't realise at the time and I just said,

355
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,289
oh, mate, I love chocolate.

356
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,230
Love it.

357
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,330
And he said to me, well, I haven't eaten chocolate in 10 years.

358
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,950
That's the sort of discipline you need if you're going to be an AFL footballer.

359
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,750
And right then and there, it was cricket, mate.

360
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,750
There's an intensity about Nathan Buckley.

361
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,429
That doesn't surprise me, but maybe he might have learnt how to celebrate

362
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:08,430
from you, Mitch, as well, which is a lesson to learn.

363
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,250
I love asking these questions because we think that success leaves clues

364
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,450
and I love your story.

365
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,509
It's such a unique, authentic story that you've carved your own path

366
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,329
out to great success.

367
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,150
I think it's hard to lead anyone else.

368
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,450
You're about to captain Australia without a sense of self-leadership.

369
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,670
What does that mean to you to lead yourself first?

370
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,470
Yeah.

371
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,329
Yeah, well, I think the most important thing for me is just staying true

372
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:39,190
to who I am, looking after my people, which, you know,

373
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:44,250
within cricket is the team and creating an environment where people feel

374
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,710
really trusted to just do their thing.

375
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,630
And within our team, that's been one of the biggest things

376
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,930
that's led us to success.

377
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,069
And I think that starts with me.

378
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,990
You've got to lead that yourself and stay true to yourself.

379
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:58,910
Mitch, we see.

380
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,789
We see people who are successful consistently are really conscious

381
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,269
about the impact they have on others in their environment.

382
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,589
You play in that tight-knit team that travels around the world

383
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,029
and you're constantly having an impact on each other all the time.

384
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:13,089
How have you gone about that?

385
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,950
I mean, I think it's really down to relationships.

386
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,970
You know, we're all here for different reasons.

387
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,269
We all have different family backgrounds, come from different cultures

388
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,769
within our group, and I guess having relationships with everyone

389
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:28,269
that are meaningful.

390
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,990
Understanding who they are.

391
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,569
So I guess that when they're under pressure, you know the person

392
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:39,710
and not just the cricketer, and trying to get the best out of people.

393
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,069
So I'm new into this role as a leader within our team,

394
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:47,329
but I've learned from so many great people like Paddy

395
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,410
and like Andrew McDonald.

396
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,789
The relationships are so important.

397
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,529
And Mitch, I'm assuming you don't win the World Cup,

398
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,430
you don't win the World Test Championship or retain the Ashes

399
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,930
without a really good relationship.

400
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,470
Do you have a really clear vision around what you and your team

401
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,269
are trying to achieve?

402
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,410
We're curious about how you go about creating and sharing that vision,

403
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,089
you know, particularly in your role now.

404
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,049
Cricket throws a lot of challenges at you.

405
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,390
We play a lot of different conditions.

406
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,190
We travel to different cultures.

407
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,710
Some places are hot, some places are cold.

408
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,609
So every tour looks different for us, but we sit down at the start

409
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,430
of every tour and we speak about what we want the tour to look like

410
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,930
and feel like as a group, and we all commit to that.

411
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,930
So that's it.

412
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,230
That brings freshness to our group.

413
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,289
Every tour is a little bit different.

414
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,910
The core things around trust and looking after your mates

415
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,069
is vitally important, but that's brought a real freshness

416
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:40,009
to each tour for us.

417
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,609
And I think, you know, we travel pretty much 12 months

418
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:43,130
of the year now.

419
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,369
We play all year round.

420
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:48,690
So for people to start fresh every tour and come together,

421
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:50,130
it's worked really well for us.

422
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,130
So going into the T20 World Cup and you're captain,

423
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,069
you'll really have a clear project and mission and this is how we want

424
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:58,910
to create the environment.

425
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,349
We've got some similarities from other experiences,

426
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,150
but it's a really different set up for every challenge

427
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,869
that you want to face.

428
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,410
Is that the sort of detail you get into?

429
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,589
Yeah, absolutely.

430
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,529
The other thing too is keeping it really simple.

431
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,170
We've got a really experienced group now and it's about trusting guys

432
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,750
that are going to prepare really well.

433
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,970
We've got guys that are coming from the IPL later than some.

434
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,230
We'll give them a few days at home, but it's understanding

435
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,029
that we'll come together and tournament play is about peaking

436
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,730
at the right time.

437
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,890
So we'll hopefully build in the World Cup.

438
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,289
Yeah, get to the point at the end.

439
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:34,490
Mitch, we see people who have the sort of success we're talking

440
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,089
to you about are really curious and through curiosity,

441
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,450
they're constantly trying to get better.

442
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,609
Are you a curious type of person?

443
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,849
Yes, I am.

444
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:46,089
For me, it was more, I guess, the mental side for me rather

445
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,369
than like the skill stuff.

446
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,950
I'm always striving to get better and there's always areas

447
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,089
and different shots that you can play to get better.

448
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,349
But for me, it was about I really need to work on learning

449
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:58,650
to deal with failure.

450
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,289
And being really present.

451
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:03,430
So the curiosity side for me within cricket has been

452
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,029
around breathing during games, staying calm.

453
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,549
You know, if I play a false shot, moving on to the next ball

454
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:13,549
straight away and forgetting the rest of it and done a lot

455
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:17,650
of work in that space to, yeah, hopefully be able to stand

456
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,650
up there with a trophy in a couple of months' time.

457
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,769
Looks like you've got it in a great place.

458
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,970
Communicating really clearly is another dimension we love

459
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,650
talking about.

460
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,730
And again, you seem to have your own authentic style.

461
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,869
I love this.

462
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,369
That's why I wanted to play the speech at the start because it made

463
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:37,309
all of us smile that followed you closely and it was off script

464
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:38,869
and it was you being you.

465
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,950
Have you thought about it, Mitch, or is it just, again,

466
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,670
just being authentic?

467
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,470
Well, yeah, that speech was, yeah, it was unplanned.

468
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,710
I certainly knew there was people I wanted to thank, sorry,

469
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,829
but, yeah, probably got away from you a little bit.

470
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,230
But, yeah, a few tears and a few laughs, that's all you need

471
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,769
when you're speaking.

472
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,329
I think, yeah, communicating, I think that's one of the biggest

473
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:06,430
challenges as a leader is communicating things that everyone

474
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,130
resonates with.

475
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,089
And I think with an experienced group like ours, a lot of guys just

476
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,789
need to do their thing and they don't need to listen, but there's

477
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:17,549
a certain percentage of guys that, you know, like to be communicated

478
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,349
with and for cricket it's about being really clear with your

479
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:23,549
communication and plans with bowlers and then being, with batters,

480
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,230
it's just about being really clear in their role and allowing them

481
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,970
to express themselves.

482
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,569
So it's been, yeah.

483
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,029
It's been a hallmark of our team and Andrew McDonald is one

484
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,430
of the best communicators I've ever had and we're lucky to have him

485
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,970
as a head coach.

486
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,769
Can you give us a bit on that?

487
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,230
I just find that with him he's really consistent with it and that helps

488
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,690
the team.

489
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,410
Is there any specific things that he does that you can share?

490
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,650
I think he's got a great ability to leave emotion out of high-pressure

491
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,630
situations when he's communicating with you.

492
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,410
You know, for me over the last two years I've never been clearer

493
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,230
as to what my role is within the team.

494
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,069
When I'm batting it's always been communicated to just be myself

495
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:05,630
and that's allowed me personally to have, you know, some of the best

496
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,869
cricketing years of my life and there's plenty of other examples

497
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:09,809
of that within our team.

498
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:14,809
So, yeah, strong, clear communication is probably the most important

499
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:15,450
thing that I've learnt.

500
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,869
You mentioned some of the collaborations that you had with the mental

501
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,430
skills coaches at Cricket Australia and your great friendship

502
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,230
with Pat Cummings.

503
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,670
How important has collaboration been for you?

504
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,069
It's vital.

505
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,809
Just learning.

506
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,410
Building relationships with people and opening doors has been one of the

507
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,289
biggest things and I guess that's probably something that I was reluctant

508
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,450
at doing earlier on.

509
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,089
I sort of stayed in my own lane but now I've realised that the more I can

510
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,630
learn off others and take snippets from to build a better team around me

511
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,910
has been really cool.

512
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:52,269
And like I said before, my group with the Alita Connect team was just,

513
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,829
yeah, some of the great people and there's no doubt that they're all

514
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,210
playing in really successful teams.

515
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,650
And I understand that.

516
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:58,750
Yeah.

517
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:58,789
Yeah.

518
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,890
Yeah.

519
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:58,910
Yeah.

520
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:58,930
Yeah.

521
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,309
It may be an international collaboration that you're going to join on the

522
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,309
Alita Connect front as well, Mitch, is what I hear.

523
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,170
Yeah.

524
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,589
So Stace gave me a call before she even told me the group I was already in.

525
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,589
I just, yeah, I just loved it.

526
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,869
You know, it's given me, you know, being on the road as well gives me a bit

527
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,730
of purpose outside of just being on the road for cricket and having something

528
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,089
to look forward to every couple of weeks.

529
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,369
So, yeah, I'm stepping into, I've got a few NBA player, EPL player,

530
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,650
basketball player and one other.

531
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:28,890
Yeah.

532
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,349
Remember, I'm very fresh.

533
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,230
It's only a couple of days.

534
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:33,430
So, yeah, can't wait for that.

535
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,450
And I think I'll have a few early wake-ups.

536
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,490
But once you're in, you're in.

537
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,009
I love your attitude, Mitch.

538
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,369
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

539
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:49,809
Oh, gee, I've been extremely blessed to play under, to have great role models

540
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:50,490
within my life.

541
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,589
I think, I mean, my dad is someone that I've got a great relationship with.

542
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,849
And dad's a little bit old school in a sense that he's not a big talker.

543
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:05,630
But all of his actions that he's instilled into me about around looking

544
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,390
after people, caring for people, it's been one of my, you know,

545
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,569
he's just, he's the best dad, but one of the best leaders I've ever come

546
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:16,990
across and, yeah, I'm grateful to have him in my life.

547
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,750
Pretty lucky start in life, isn't it?

548
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,630
Getting that sort of relationship, isn't it, with your dad?

549
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,829
And I feel exactly the same.

550
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,390
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration and we talk a lot about inspiring

551
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,549
connections.

552
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:30,190
Connections and creating a world of collaboration.

553
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:32,509
Mitch, you've got a lot of great passions.

554
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:33,849
I see you out fishing.

555
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,349
I see you loving a beer with your mates.

556
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,309
I see life looks like a lot of fun.

557
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,109
Has there been, in any part of your life, it might be cricket,

558
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,430
and you thought there's someone you'd like to collaborate on any

559
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,930
of the passions in your life?

560
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,269
Is there a name that springs to mind?

561
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,710
Yeah, I thought, I think, long and hard about this, I'd love to go back

562
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,970
to the height of Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson.

563
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,269
And just be a fly on the wall.

564
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,130
You hear so many great stories about him being hard, being caring, and just

565
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,930
driving this team to ultimate success.

566
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,670
So, yeah, I'd love to go back to, what is it, early 2000s or 90s when

567
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,950
United were on a heater and even just sit down and have a glass of red with

568
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,069
him.

569
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,829
I met him at a game, a Manchester United game during the Ashes.

570
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,049
And the first thing he said to me was, I hate cricket.

571
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:24,990
It's boring.

572
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,970
So, I probably got that collaboration wrong there.

573
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:38,390
But, yeah, he was someone that, obviously, would be amazing to sit down

574
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,029
and talk all things leadership, I guess.

575
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,009
You know where you stand with Sir Alex, don't you?

576
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,269
Right off the bat, that's...

577
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,829
You hear so many stories about, you know, you knew exactly where you stood

578
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:50,670
with Sir Alex, so there you go.

579
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,829
Won't be no free tickets for him next Ashes.

580
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:52,950
Yes.

581
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,670
Yes.

582
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:53,950
Yes.

583
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,269
Yes.

584
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:54,289
Yes.

585
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:54,309
Yes.

586
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:54,329
Yes.

587
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:54,349
Yes.

588
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:54,369
Yes.

589
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:54,390
Yes.

590
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,410
Yes.

591
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:54,430
Yes.

592
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:54,450
Yes.

593
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:54,470
Yes.

594
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,490
Yes.

595
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:54,509
Yes.

596
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:54,529
Yes.

597
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:54,569
Yes.

598
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:54,589
Yes.

599
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:54,630
Yes.

600
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,690
Yes.

601
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,769
And were you a round ball Manchester United fan as a kid?

602
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:58,829
Were you growing up?

603
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:03,490
Growing up, my brother was big time, so I followed them.

604
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,210
I followed them just like, so I could stay up the show and watch, but I'm more of an

605
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,769
AFL man.

606
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,069
Hey, Mitch, I think your life story is a great lesson to me in being authentically yourself

607
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,069
and the path to finding that.

608
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,890
It's such a great thing to see someone, as I said earlier, so comfortable in their own

609
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,450
skin and every success that comes your way, you've earned.

610
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,450
And it's brilliant.

611
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,230
I have followed you closely since that early encounter as a 17-year-old.

612
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,829
To see you now as captain of Australia is just one of the great success stories of all

613
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:33,829
time.

614
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:34,829
And we wish you all the best.

615
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:35,829
Thanks for joining me today.

616
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:36,829
Thanks for having me, Darce.

617
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,829
It's been a pleasure.
