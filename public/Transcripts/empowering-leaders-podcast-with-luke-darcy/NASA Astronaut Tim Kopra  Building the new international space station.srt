00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,150
Well, what a great privilege it was this week to meet NASA astronaut Tim Kopra.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,089
I'm sure you're going to be fascinated by Tim as much as I was in spending some time with him.

3
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,850
You're going to hear Tim talk about his respect for Elon Musk

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,629
and the fact that Elon's innovation is pushing the space industry to new levels and frontiers.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,329
You're going to hear him talk about the impossible selection process at NASA

6
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,629
where thousands of the world's best and brightest are competing for literally one or two opportunities

7
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,590
and that remarkably, he explains that in the end, the deciding factor is

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,009
basically who is the person you'd most like to go camping with.

9
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:43,409
Tim also explains how space is still the great story of international diplomacy,

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,750
how Russia, America and Europe all collaborate together

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,729
and why we need to learn more about that here on Earth.

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,810
It's people like NASA astronaut Tim Kopra who inspire the work we do at Alita.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,630
We are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:11,150
We would love to connect and collaborate with you.

19
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:12,730
Book a discovery call today.

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,090
Huge thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team at Tempa Australia and New Zealand.

21
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,790
NASA approved bedding is what Tempa is

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,769
and astronauts like Tim Kopra understand seriously the importance of great sleep.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,790
Tempa is a mattress like no other.

24
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,510
Encourage you to check one out today.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,459
Tim Kopra is a distinguished friend

26
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,060
of the British former US Army Colonel, NASA astronaut

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,260
and is currently the CEO of Starlab,

28
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,879
a joint venture between Voyager Space and Airbus

29
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,739
who are designing, building and will eventually operate

30
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,400
the Starlab commercial space station in collaboration with NASA.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,519
Tim has a Bachelor of Science from the United States Military Academy, West Point,

32
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,219
a Masters of Science in Aerospace Engineering,

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,920
a Masters of Strategic Studies and an MBA.

34
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,219
Tim served his country, the United States, with great distinction,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,079
awarded the Legion of Merit,

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,459
the Bronze Star Medal,

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,480
two Meritorious Service Medals,

38
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,379
Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal,

39
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,460
Army Achievement Medal,

40
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,219
NASA Space Flight Medal,

41
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,680
NASA Distinguished Service Medal

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,240
before officially becoming an astronaut with NASA in the year 2000.

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Tim's recording this interview with me live today in Melbourne, Australia

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,280
in his new role as the CEO of a space technology company

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,199
powering the next frontier of space travel.

46
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,139
Tim, it's a great pleasure to meet you.

47
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,620
Thanks for joining me here today.

48
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:29,659
Yeah, thanks, Luke.

49
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,740
I'm really excited to be here.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,080
When you hear me read all that back to you,

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,259
there must be a sense of having lived,

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,259
all life, surely.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,400
For sure.

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,919
In fact, when you read that back,

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,360
I start to feel tired because it sounds like a lot,

56
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,099
but it's been a really fun ride.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,139
And I've had, I think, a really fulfilling career

58
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,300
and really looking forward to this next chapter.

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,580
Tim, you were six years old when Neil Armstrong said those famous words,

60
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,879
a small step for man, a giant leap for mankind.

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,139
Do you have a memory of that day and did it inspire you?

62
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,780
Actually, not that day, but the second flight, actually,

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
because my brother, who's six years older,

64
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,340
was really fascinated with space.

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,000
And so I remember staying up late with my big brother

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,120
waiting for this moon landing.

67
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,639
And I thought, what an amazing thing, right, as a six-year-old.

68
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,539
And I think that, especially for young people,

69
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,939
when they're inspired at that early age,

70
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:19,900
it really sticks with you.

71
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
And it's always in the back of my mind.

72
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,199
Becoming an astronaut seemed like an unrealistic goal.

73
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,479
But one time when I was at West Point, I was a plebe.

74
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,099
And the plebe is really the lowest end of the totem pole.

75
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,180
And I'm sitting at the dinner table.

76
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
And we had three people.

77
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
I had three former Apollo astronauts come

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,060
and speak to the Corps of Cadets.

79
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,439
And it was a seminal moment for me

80
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,800
because I realized those three guys

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,199
had been sitting in my chair just a few decades before.

82
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,500
And I thought, if I really focus on this,

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,000
I study hard and do the same kinds of things they did,

84
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,500
maybe I would have a chance in the future

85
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,520
and super fortunate to become an astronaut back in 2000.

86
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,539
And Tim, that flame really flickered at that moment,

87
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,599
sitting in front of a group of astronauts

88
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,560
and thinking, I could possibly get there.

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,180
It did.

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,659
I mean, it really did inspire me.

91
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,620
And even then,

92
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,580
I thought it was a completely unrealistic goal.

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
But there was a path carved by former Army astronauts

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
on this way to at least get a shot at it.

95
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,259
And so I went to NASA in 1998.

96
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,920
I was invited to work at NASA as an engineer

97
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,360
for a couple of years before I got selected.

98
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,120
So, I mean, it definitely inspired me from that day.

99
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,180
When you think about being a colonel in the Army

100
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,300
and an astronaut,

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,180
you go into the tiniest percentage of high achievers

102
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,360
in the world.

103
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,160
And you said to yourself,

104
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,699
it felt like an unrealistic goal.

105
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm curious.

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm curious about what are the things

107
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
that have allowed you to get there?

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,819
What sort of habits,

109
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,360
what sort of routines have you got

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,779
that you think enabled you to achieve what you have?

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,459
I think that education is super important.

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,120
Education, and I've talked to lots of school kids

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,579
as a requirement at NASA.

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,939
We do a lot of outreach,

115
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,620
public outreach with students.

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,079
And for me, education is like tools in your kit bag.

117
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,300
And it's things that you draw on in the future.

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,019
And even things that the subject that you study

119
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,639
that you may not use explicitly,

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
form the way that you think.

121
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,839
Like math, for example,

122
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,800
you may never do calculus again,

123
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,120
but it teaches you how to think.

124
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,420
When you look at history and you learn about history,

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,439
it gives you an idea of how humans think

126
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,220
and how they lead and how they operate.

127
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,459
So all these subjects,

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,339
even though you may not use them directly,

129
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,500
they give you an idea about how you can perform in the future.

130
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,060
And another lesson I think that's super important

131
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,160
that I got from really growing up

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
and also at West Point

133
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,060
is the need to get along with people.

134
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,639
At the end of the day,

135
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,560
especially as astronauts,

136
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,040
being able to get along and work well with others

137
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
is super important.

138
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,519
And I'm assuming there's a high level of discipline

139
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,879
associated with your life.

140
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,740
You don't let things get off track

141
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,060
to want to get into that tiny bracket.

142
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,639
What about a daily version of you?

143
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,060
Are there things that you do every day

144
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,300
that you think stand you in good stead?

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Yeah, for sure.

146
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,939
I mean, discipline is certainly a part of a successful career.

147
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,500
You know, for me, working out is important.

148
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,399
You need to moderate yourself.

149
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,180
You need to maintain good relationships,

150
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,579
keep your,

151
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,420
your ego in check,

152
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,759
bounce back from disappointment.

153
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,839
In terms of daily routine,

154
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,459
I'm not sure at this point

155
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,800
because things are so dynamic

156
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,839
that my routine is as stable as it should be.

157
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,000
But I certainly need to maintain good relationships

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,759
with my wife and our kids,

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,819
make sure that I stay healthy.

160
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,800
Those are things I think that are super important.

161
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,420
And, you know, even the relationships,

162
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,019
you know, with my coworkers,

163
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,959
it's super important

164
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,639
because you build trust with people.

165
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,579
Those are things that happen every day.

166
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,779
Well, fascinating to hear you,

167
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,220
you know,

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Tom's already, you've talked about

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,819
maintaining good relationships with your coworkers,

170
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,360
with your wife.

171
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,759
And there's a story that I read a book,

172
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:41,899
Chris Hadfield's book,

173
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,500
An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,980
You're smiling.

175
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,800
I assume you know it well.

176
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,319
And he speaks about the rigors of the selection process

177
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,319
to become an astronaut.

178
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,459
And one of the stories that he tells

179
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,060
is of a cocktail party right at the end

180
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,019
where you assume you're already in

181
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:00,040
and you're in this elite group of super talented people,

182
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,800
but the selection panel are actually observing,

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
in a really specific way.

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,480
And what they're looking for is who in that setting,

185
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,680
in a relaxed setting actually is a team player.

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,019
Who's got those relationship building skills.

187
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,120
And they're looking not for the peacock

188
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,279
or the person who thinks they may be a bit of a superhero.

189
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,899
Does that ring true to you?

190
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,740
Oh, for sure.

191
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,980
In fact, I was on two selection committees in 2013 and 2017.

192
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,860
In 2013, we had 18,300 applicants and we selected eight.

193
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,300
And during that last interview period

194
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,639
where we had 50 folks that we went through,

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,439
I think everybody who sat around the table

196
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,139
that was part of that interview crew was thinking,

197
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,360
like, who do you want to go camping with?

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,100
At that point, people have good educational background,

199
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,319
they have good experience,

200
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,199
they have some leadership qualities,

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
but these are people you're going to spend six months

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,779
inside a space station with.

203
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,160
And so the camping skills are actually really pertinent.

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,540
And what is camping like?

205
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,279
Camping, like I went on a trip with our son, Matthew,

206
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,379
to Philmont, which is a Boy Scout camp in New Mexico.

207
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,839
And camping skills are like you're on time

208
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,500
and you roll up your own sleeves,

209
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,800
roll up your own sleeping bag, you clean up your own area,

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,379
people don't have to wait on you.

211
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,680
You're a good follower.

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,459
A good follower is someone who intrinsically knows

213
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,100
how to fit into the team.

214
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,680
And then a good leader is someone who knows the skills

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
of those people on the team and finds sort of a way

216
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
to create synergy between those people.

217
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,480
So like those camping skills are really vital.

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,319
It's also like, you know, kindergarten skills,

219
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,319
you know, playing well with others,

220
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,939
don't steal somebody else's toys.

221
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,240
I find that fascinating.

222
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,740
You've got 18,000 applicants,

223
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,980
you've got some of the smartest people on the planet,

224
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,440
the most high achievers, and at the end,

225
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,320
you just want to work out who you want to be around

226
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
is almost as important as any other stage.

227
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,539
Is that how you see it?

228
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,899
Yeah, it's equal points, right?

229
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,039
So, I mean, certainly by that point in the interview process,

230
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,080
people have the skills and there's lots of skills required

231
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,919
as an astronaut.

232
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,799
You have to be physically fit.

233
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,539
You have to be able to think quickly.

234
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,799
You need to be able to be decisive,

235
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,220
but be able to work well with others is absolutely vital.

236
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,000
And do you use that same criteria

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,480
now you're running a big business?

238
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll get to that in a moment.

239
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,759
Do you think about that when you're building the team now?

240
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,600
For sure.

241
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,419
Culture fit is super important.

242
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:09,879
Can't say we've always done it perfectly,

243
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,419
but you know, like for interviews with us,

244
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,820
one thing that I think is really important

245
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,539
are we make sure that we understand the talent profiles,

246
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,519
which is similar to what NASA does.

247
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,460
And then we have questions around those talent profiles.

248
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,000
We have a team interview

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
because that way you can check with the other people

250
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,600
to make sure that you have some sort of alignment

251
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,679
between what you saw.

252
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,440
Having something in person,

253
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,759
so just like that astronaut social,

254
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,259
which was so important,

255
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,519
we do the same kind of thing

256
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,519
so we can spend time with people.

257
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,559
And then any sort of personal references.

258
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,000
I think that there's the transitive property of trust.

259
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
You know, if I'm friends with someone

260
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,860
and they trust a person,

261
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,539
then more than likely I'm going to trust that person they do.

262
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,259
So that's a really important part.

263
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,100
That's a great term,

264
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,080
the transcendent process of trust, isn't it?

265
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,500
A referral from someone you trust

266
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,159
is a pretty powerful thing in any space, isn't it?

267
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,000
Absolutely.

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,299
I mean, it's really hard to know somebody from interviews.

269
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,500
Like in our business, we're building it very quickly

270
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,580
and you want to bring people on the team.

271
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,340
And so that means you need,

272
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,279
especially in like human space flight,

273
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
I think every business will say this,

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,340
that it's really relationship-based.

275
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,840
I think ours is especially relationship-based

276
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,759
because you can really find out a lot about people

277
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,840
by just a couple of phone calls.

278
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,620
So I want to ask you about walking in space.

279
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,960
Only a couple of hundred humans in history have done it.

280
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,980
You've clocked up over 13 hours.

281
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,379
You spent eight months living

282
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,320
on the International Space Station in two separate stints.

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,500
Can you describe what that's like?

284
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a pretty amazing thing

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,620
going outside of a spaceship in a space suit.

286
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,000
So we train for this inside this big pool

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,679
at Johnson Space Center called the Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

288
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,840
And it's the size of a lake.

289
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,179
It's 200 feet across, 100 feet wide, and 40 feet deep,

290
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:56,019
and has a mock-up of the International Space Station in it.

291
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,419
And so all those technical skills of using the tools

292
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,399
and translating and executing procedures

293
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,980
are what you learn in that big pool.

294
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,379
And it mostly prepares you for doing a spacewalk,

295
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,500
but not completely.

296
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,259
So on my first spacewalk, we launched on flight day one.

297
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,320
We orbited the planet on flight day two

298
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,580
and got in the same orbit as space station.

299
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,419
We docked on flight day three.

300
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,259
And then the morning of flight day four, I did a spacewalk.

301
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,059
So barely over space sickness and going out.

302
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,159
And I was the guy who opened the hatch.

303
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,360
So you open the hatch, and you're

304
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,019
looking down at the planet going past you

305
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,740
at five miles a second.

306
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,159
And it kind of takes your breath away for a minute.

307
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,620
But then you go back to your training

308
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,340
and say, OK, what's the next step?

309
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,840
And just get out the door and start doing your job.

310
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,440
But it's a really amazing experience.

311
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,259
It's hard to describe, because on Earth,

312
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,600
we take it for granted that there's a down.

313
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,539
And when you're crawling over the space station,

314
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,500
all you have is this structure that you're hanging onto.

315
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,740
And it's definitely a team sport,

316
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,580
because you're trained by the people on the ground.

317
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,100
You're talking with people.

318
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,559
You're talking with people on the ground.

319
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:58,700
You're talking with people on the ground.

320
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,799
You're talking with people on the ground.

321
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:58,899
You're talking with people on the ground.

322
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,000
You're talking with people on the ground.

323
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,139
You're talking with people on the ground.

324
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,659
The ground crew that's walking you through the procedure.

325
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,759
And all of that has to work together.

326
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,820
I love how you described a bit of your breath being

327
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,299
taken away.

328
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,379
I'm glad that it's a natural human experience.

329
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,919
And I think of being attached to a robotic arm

330
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,419
on a piece of metal that's doing a lap of the Earth

331
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,679
every 90 minutes, effectively.

332
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,259
That's how quick you're moving.

333
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:16,759
Yeah.

334
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,399
Is there a moment where you have to breathe and get past.

335
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,039
There's got to be an element of fear.

336
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm not sure fear is the right emotional word.

337
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,279
I think it's anxiety.

338
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,899
Because fear is like.

339
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,039
when a loved one has a medical condition and you're worried about their life. That's fear

340
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,240
because it's like unknown. This is really a known environment. I mean, it's very unusual

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,799
and you're anxious, probably more anxious about messing up and making a mistake than you are about

342
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,620
the fact that you're in space. But I mean, it's definitely something that you do have to kind of

343
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,440
catch your breath. And does it take your breath away looking back at the curvature of the earth?

344
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,120
Oh, for sure. It's a beautiful planet. I mean, it's really incredible. You know,

345
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,840
living on board space station, we have this big window called the cupola. It's six windows in a

346
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,860
circle and a big window in the center. And it's like a glass bottom boat. And you're going around

347
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,259
the planet every 90 minutes, as you mentioned, but the planet's also rotating. So you're always

348
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:20,620
seeing a new spot on this beautiful globe, but being out there in space, like not through the

349
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,059
window and looking through your plexiglass visor. I mean, it's, it's almost eye-watering on my,

350
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,360
uh,

351
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,980
my third spacewalk, we got out to the very end of space station to replace this big box.

352
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,460
And we got there early because we had to change out this box when it was dark and it was still

353
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,799
daylight. And so, uh, Tim Peake and I did this spacewalk and we're just hanging out on the very,

354
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,980
very tip of space station, just like watching this amazing planet going around us. It was,

355
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,159
I mean, just what an incredible site. The global space economy, Tim, is estimated

356
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,120
worth of about 550 billion a year in 2020 was an estimate of in the next five years, 41%

357
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,799
growth. It's a, it's a huge business and a group of Australians through a listed fund,

358
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,659
Octus, have, have backed you in this new mission. Can you tell us about the business of space that

359
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:09,960
you're in now and, and why are you here in Australia? Yeah, for sure. So we're very

360
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,840
excited to be partnered with Octus. Uh, they really give access to the Australian community

361
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,340
and private investment for space. They become experts, frankly, in Australia when it comes to

362
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,000
space investing. And one of the companies they've invested in is Voyager. And in my new role as

363
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,519
CEO of Starlab. It's a joint venture between Voyager and Airbus, and we're expanding that

364
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,259
actually to Japan and potentially Canada. So really recreating the International Space Station

365
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:43,440
partnership, but with the best in class companies instead of countries. So really exciting. And so

366
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,580
we're here in Australia to get the word out about this opportunity set of how important space is,

367
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,960
but also to your point about its growth. And Tim, when I think about the International Space

368
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,500
Station and what a collaboration that is, you've got Russia and America and many countries in

369
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Europe. You trained in Russia and learnt the language as part of your mission to be on the

370
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,740
International Space Station. It's a great piece of international diplomacy that we get right in

371
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,139
space. Have you got a theory on why we struggle to get that collaboration here on Earth?

372
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,820
It's a great question. You know, space is one of these things where there's a common interest.

373
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,860
You know, for example, certainly there are massive tensions right now with

374
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,940
Russia. But that relationship actually started back in the 70s, and it started with two people.

375
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,639
It started with Jim Stafford, who was on an Apollo Soyuz mission, and then Alexei Leonov,

376
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:41,139
who's the first spacewalker in history, a very accomplished Russian cosmonaut. They became fast

377
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,980
friends. They're actually godfathers of each other's kids. And so from that, that graduated

378
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,200
into the Shuttle-Mir program when we docked the space shuttle to the Mir Space Station,

379
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,600
and then the International Space Station.

380
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,120
I mean, certainly that relationship is very tenuous now, but it comes down to people and

381
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,519
relationships. And I think the thing that's special about space is that it's very mission

382
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,200
oriented. To the extent possible, it's not really a military thing. It's really about this common

383
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,419
goal of exploration. You know, my time in Russia was super positive. I have great Russian friends

384
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,019
and memories, and they have great expertise that we've learned from, and vice versa. I just wish

385
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,740
that we could, you know, get back on that track. It's incredible, isn't it, when you're

386
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:23,840
thinking about that? Yeah.

387
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,820
I think it's two people that things start in a positive way and opening those lines. It seems

388
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,980
like a tenuous place, the world a bit at the moment, but effectively, a couple of people can

389
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,460
change the world as that astronaut and cosmonaut did, as you described.

390
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,799
Absolutely. It's about leadership, you know, and you had two great leaders who came together

391
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,620
and really affected policy. I hope we can do it again.

392
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,620
Elon Musk through SpaceX and his Starlink satellites bringing broadband to every corner

393
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,139
of the globe is a fascinating story to me. It seems as though he's disrupted

394
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:53,740
the space.

395
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,179
Space industry in a bit of the same way as he has done with the car industry. How do you view his

396
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,000
contribution?

397
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:04,119
Well, I think it's been fundamental. He's reduced the cost of access to space. That's really changed

398
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:10,160
the game. He's created rockets that are reusable in a way that had never been done before. I think

399
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,500
people were very maybe pessimistic about his ability to do that. But, you know, if you go

400
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,220
back to the history of SpaceX, there's definitely a role of NASA in that relationship. In fact,

401
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,460
there were two space companies in early days.

402
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,799
that NASA helped to fund, and the back history on that is that NASA decided to retire the space

403
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:36,140
shuttle back in 2006, and the last mission was in 2011. And so NASA needed a way in which they

404
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,559
could resupply the International Space Station and get crew. So they established this program

405
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,480
called the Space Act Agreement, which gave a funding mechanism for these new companies.

406
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,599
And at the time, it was SpaceX and Orbital Sciences, and they were funded $1.6 and $1.9

407
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,519
billion. And they were early companies then. At that point, SpaceX hadn't even flown to space yet.

408
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,119
Orbital Sciences hadn't launched a rocket that could get to a space station. And it was that

409
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:09,400
early funding that was really seed funding that helped develop that whole ecosystem that Elon

410
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,119
Musk has really excelled in. I love that you're replacing this incredible thing, the International

411
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,859
Space Station. That's an amazing success story. And it's not as though you've got a template to

412
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,359
start from. I mean, it's...

413
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah.

414
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:22,579
I love it.

415
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:22,599
I love it.

416
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,599
I love that you're doing it with Airbus. And I see Hilton Hotels are coming on board as part of

417
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,339
the design. Tell us about where do you start on something like that?

418
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,980
Well, you know, one of the things we started with when we first partnered with Airbus was

419
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,420
leveraging a design they had for a science habitation module that they had spent a lot of

420
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,960
resources to develop. So a very large structure and taking advantage of the fact that there's

421
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,640
going to be a Starship, which is SpaceX's vehicle, one of the largest rockets ever made,

422
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,460
if not the largest. And what that allowed us to do was,

423
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,619
fundamentally, change about how you design a space station. In the past, they had to be relatively

424
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:03,599
small tin cans that got put together like Legos. And that design was really based upon fitting

425
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,460
inside the payload bay of the space shuttle. What this does is allow us to graduate beyond that and

426
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,599
have a massive space station that can go up on a single launch, which means we don't have to spend

427
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,319
more money on additional launches. We can do all the integration on the ground. And then once it's

428
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,400
launched, we can start to generate revenue, which is important because this is a transition.

429
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,940
It's both a partnership from, you know, government to commercial industry, but it's also like a public

430
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,859
private partnership with NASA so that we can both leverage the commercial world, but also take care

431
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:40,779
of professional astronauts like NASA, European Space Agency, the ones from Japan at JAXA.

432
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,539
Tim, I've used the term before, you've lived a full life. It feels like you're not slowing down

433
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,500
anytime soon. But I love asking this question because we've all got a family. You've spent a

434
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,380
lot of time away from your family in pursuit of this mission. And I think it's really important to

435
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:52,880
keep that in mind. And I think it's really important to keep that in mind. And I think it's

436
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,380
really important to keep that in mind. And I think it's really important to keep that in mind.

437
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
How do you get that balance right?

438
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,980
Oh, I'm not sure you ever get that balance right. I've strived to do that. You know, when I was

439
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,799
training for my second mission, I was the co-pilot in the Russian Soyuz. And so I had to be trained

440
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,500
up at the same level as the Russian cosmonaut Soyuz commander. So I spent every other month in

441
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,480
Russia for two and a half years, spent a lot of time away. But, you know, thankfully, there's

442
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,279
telephone and, you know, video conferences and things like that. So to the extent possible,

443
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,119
you try to maintain those connections. And then even living on board Space Station,

444
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,539
one of the things that NASA has done particularly well is focusing on the psychological support

445
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,299
on board Space Station. So I talked to my wife every day that I was on board Space Station on

446
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,140
an internet protocol telephone and had a video conference once a week with her and other family.

447
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,680
So to me, that's brilliant that you're actually thinking about that detail. So you can literally

448
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,440
call home on a daily basis from the International Space Station.

449
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,960
For sure. In fact, it's a very special call when you get one from Space Station. I've had some of

450
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,220
my friends call me from Space Station and I spent eight months there. It should be routine, but

451
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,160
I get jazzed when I get a call from Space Station. And I have some friends that I called when I was

452
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,839
on board. I kept a long list and tried to call my closest friends and family. And some of those

453
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:12,079
folks weren't around. And so it was a message on their voice message. And they're so excited,

454
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,359
they kept it and they play it for their friends. It's just an exciting thing, like connecting space

455
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,440
with humanity on planet Earth. And Tim, we say a lot in this podcast,

456
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,599
leaves clues. And I'm always curious about NASA astronaut and the patterns that are left behind

457
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,619
for what great leadership looks like. I want to ask you a series of questions that I've asked

458
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:36,079
everyone that's come on this podcast. And we think one of the dimensions of leadership is this idea

459
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,200
of self-leadership. It's very hard to lead anyone else without a sense of self-leadership. What does

460
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,339
that mean to you? Self-leadership. I think that you need to have humility because no one cornered

461
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,940
the market on good. You need to build trust.

462
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,000
And trust is always two ways. So I think trust is actually fundamental. As a leader,

463
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,400
you need to keep in touch with yourself, try to be grounded. None of us are perfect. I'm certainly

464
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,900
not. But making sure that you keep yourself in check. And if you have close friends and you have

465
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,839
close relationships, then you get a feedback loop on that, which is important to understand where

466
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,380
you are. I think those are some elements. I love what you said. No one's cornered

467
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,940
the market on good and staying humble. Have you got trusted friends?

468
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,799
Friends that give you that feedback loop? I do. Some are very close, like personal

469
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,180
friends. But even within work relationships, it's important to get that feedback.

470
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,940
And Tim, we see leaders are really conscious these days around, on a daily basis, how they

471
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,880
go about having a positive impact on everyone they encounter and their work environments and

472
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,940
their home environments. How have you thought about having a positive impact on others?

473
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,480
I think that having a positive impact in the workplace means that people are excited about

474
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,940
what they do.

475
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,539
That they feel good about coming into work every day. That they feel like they have purpose.

476
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:02,460
I think purpose, we talked about Elon Musk. For all the things that may be unique about his

477
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,900
leadership style, one thing that he is, I think, really excelled at is giving people a sense of

478
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,799
his vision and purpose. And so he hires the best and the brightest. They live and work in Hawthorne

479
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,859
outside of LA. Maybe not the nicest place. Maybe they don't get the best pay. But they're super

480
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,940
excited about what they do every single day. And I think that's a really good thing.

481
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,079
And that's one thing I do admire about him and we try to emulate.

482
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,359
Which leads into the next dimension I was going to ask you about. It's a huge vision that

483
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:32,259
your team are undertaking. I mean, how do you go about sharing

484
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,200
that vision that you want to try and execute with the team?

485
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:42,079
It has to be real. And I think sometimes when people think about space, it feels very esoteric

486
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,920
and hard. For me, building a space station is a lot like a terrestrial infrastructure project.

487
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,880
I mean, it's certainly going to space. So there's that level of complexity,

488
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,799
the hardest part is really the launch. In fact, maybe a side story. When I was on board space

489
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,640
station, there's three times that you know your life's in peril. When you launch, when you do a

490
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,059
spacewalk, and when you come back home. But when you live and work on board a space station,

491
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,339
it's a shirt sleeve environment. You have to remind yourself that on the other side of that

492
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:15,599
piece of metal is a vacuum and that anything could happen. But we understand space stations.

493
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,539
We understand the technology and we're building it. But what I've seen both at

494
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,720
Nanoracks, the company where I've worked and led, and with Starlab, people are excited about

495
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,359
this tangible connection with building something in space. People are excited about this because

496
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:38,000
they recognize that it's one step towards our expansion of humanity and really exploration.

497
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,579
I think there's something about the human condition that's in all of us that want to

498
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:47,559
be explorers. And when people can touch that and be a part of it, whether it's small or great,

499
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,700
they get super excited.

500
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,180
Hard not to get it.

501
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:56,140
Excited about. And space has provided a lot for humanity that perhaps we don't think about. Can

502
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,319
you give us some of the examples? I think the CT scan came out of space technology. I think

503
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,900
might even be the insulin pump for diabetics. It's been a fertile ground, hasn't it,

504
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,960
for improving our lives?

505
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,079
It has. I would say that a lot of the technology base that we have in Silicon Valley and really

506
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,420
around the globe, at least has across the board, places where it touches back to the space

507
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,319
industry. The miniaturization,

508
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:27,420
even more recently, like the life support systems we have on board, how we can take carbon dioxide

509
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:33,299
and clean it up and turn it into oxygen on board a space station. There's lots of little things.

510
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,099
And one of the challenges I think NASA has in terms of translating what they do on their national

511
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,839
space station to daily life is that it's a lot of fundamental research. And those are really small

512
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,480
building blocks that lead into applied research and then to products. And so it's a long path to

513
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,519
get there. But even with that, there's a lot of research that we need to do. And I think that's

514
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:50,599
one of the things that we need to do. And I think that's one of the things that we need to do. And I think

515
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,420
there's been some really interesting developments, even recently, that have happened on the

516
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,180
International Space Station. So for example, Merck worked with a drug called Keytruda, which is a

517
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,339
cancer drug. And because when you remove gravity from the equation, you can really learn lots of

518
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:11,460
new things. So for example, they created millions of these perfect crystals that fundamentally

519
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,079
change in which the drug can be delivered. And in fact, some of my former colleagues on board the

520
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,920
International Space Station grew a meniscus.

521
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:26,779
So it sounds like science fiction, but we're on the edge of really fundamentally changing what you

522
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:32,200
do on planet Earth based upon what we do in space. Fascinating. We see curiosity come up a lot in

523
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,880
these conversations and that leaders like you are constantly curious about life. And through that,

524
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,880
that's how they approach getting better and learning. Is that something that you think about?

525
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:48,039
For sure. Curiosity, it's a good term. I am curious in that I really want to be able to

526
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,460
push myself. But also, I talked about

527
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,299
purpose before. I need to have purpose for me to try to translate that purpose to others.

528
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,099
So I think that really connects back to curiosity. For me, in this opportunity,

529
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,059
when it's a connection between a lot of things I've done in my entire career and having this

530
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:11,039
evolution of the next space station, to me, that's the exciting part. And the curiosity piece

531
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,759
comes into how do we design and optimize a space station? I have eight months on board and lots of

532
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,259
opinions. Some are probably good, some maybe not.

533
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,039
But in terms of how do we optimize the way that you live and work on board a space station?

534
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,920
And even though the International Space Station is an amazing vehicle and I have tremendous respect

535
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,759
for it, we can really take this next level where the experience of crew is much better.

536
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,079
The development that we are able to develop, the development that we can make on this station will

537
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,980
be next level. So to me, that's super exciting. And I think the excitement connects back to the

538
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,099
curiosity and that sense of purpose. Communicating with clarity is another

539
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:50,440
dimension.

540
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,039
A leadership I'm always keen to talk about. As a colonel in the army and someone who's

541
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,519
lived on the space station, I'm assuming you've got some thoughts on how to communicate.

542
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,380
Yeah. One lesson that I heard a while ago, which I think about a lot, is that sometimes people don't

543
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,380
hear the message until they've heard it seven times. So I think repetition is an important part.

544
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,859
What that also means is that I personally have to have clarity because the message has to be

545
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:20,220
consistent. So be able to drive home that message. And when the message changes,

546
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,960
then be able to explain why it's changed and what that new course is. But communication is

547
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,220
absolutely key. And I think all of us need to work on that every single day. Because as humans,

548
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,359
sometimes we don't hear the same things that we think we're communicating. And closing that loop,

549
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,099
I think, is around repetition. But it's also around building the trust so that you can have

550
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:47,200
these really open conversations with people. Tim, we are really passionate about collaboration.

551
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,400
And it seems like that's been a fair piece of your life's work and what

552
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,059
you're doing now is bringing together great pieces of collaboration. How important is that

553
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,779
been for you? Collaboration is a really interesting word. Because I think sometimes people think about

554
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:04,279
collaboration as consensus. It's not. The collaboration is getting people to work

555
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:09,839
together and get to a place where you have to make a decision. So really being pedantic,

556
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:16,279
three types of leadership, command leadership, consultative, and consensus-based. More often

557
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,279
than not, in my mind, the right combination is setting up a collaborative environment,

558
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,200
but then using the consultative method of leadership to, at the end of the day,

559
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,400
make a decision. And you want to reach consensus to the extent possible. If there's

560
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,880
massive disagreement, then something's not working right. But at the end of the day,

561
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,839
you have to make decisions because there's limited resources when you build a business.

562
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,240
There's money and time and there's performance. And in a big program like ours, we have to move

563
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,160
at the right pace and we have to make the right decisions. And frankly, like any business,

564
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,440
if we make a mistake, we have to make a decision. And I think that's a really important part of

565
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,839
we just need to identify it and get back on track. But collaboration is absolutely key.

566
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,480
Even in an army setting, you think of the army as the ultimate command leadership,

567
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,579
but I understand there is a lot more collaboration than we understand. Is that correct?

568
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:07,680
I think that sometimes the military, because we watch movies, we think that it's that general

569
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,359
who's telling young people to charge the hill. I think by and large, the military is really good

570
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:19,539
at the consultative level of leadership and the collaboration piece. Because just like at NASA,

571
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:20,440
when it comes to the military, it's really good at the consultative level of leadership.

572
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,980
That sense of purpose and mission. The military is that way as well. That mission piece is really

573
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:33,720
clear. When I was at MDA, it's the largest space company in Canada. And I first took over the

574
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,160
robotics and space operations there. And one of my first all hands, I mentioned about sense of

575
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,779
mission. And some of the young engineers are like, well, what does that mean? And I was kind of taken

576
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:49,920
aback that what was clear to me in terms of having the sense of purpose and mission wasn't clear. And

577
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,940
I think that's important for the leader to be able to really clearly articulate that.

578
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,240
Tim, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

579
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,720
That's a great question. I think back to a couple of people that had huge impacts on me.

580
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,299
One of my teachers in high school kind of turned my course from being a bit of a ne'er-do-well as

581
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:17,240
a freshman in high school to one where I understood that there was this pathway of

582
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,039
getting to West Point. I got really intrigued as a junior in high school.

583
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,839
Going off to West Point and was super encouraging and really helped for me along that path. And then

584
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:34,039
I'd have to say my first military commander, a guy named Hawk Ruth, who was the colonel in charge of

585
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,859
the air cavalry unit that I was part of. And I hope he listens to this because I always thought

586
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:44,059
of him as kind of like that Robert Duvall character in Apocalypse Now, a really bombastic

587
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:49,339
leader. But he really cared for his people and he was able to translate that sense of mission to the

588
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:49,900
people. In fact, I've heard a lot of people say, well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

589
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:49,980
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

590
00:31:49,980 --> 00:32:01,500
In fact, I just he called me the other day and we were chatting and he was talking about that time period when he commanded the aircraft squadron and that that sense of purpose and mission and how people still get back to him.

591
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:14,039
So people like that have really inspired me. And, you know, it's interesting about the military experience in the army. Oftentimes, I think that first that first assignment, those first three years is super impactful.

592
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:37,180
I went to my first school after that assignment. It was one of these professional development schools. And you could almost identify if people had been from a good unit or a not great unit. Really formative. Those early years, especially for males, like our brains aren't really formed when you're 22 years old. You know, it takes a little bit of time. And so those first few years are really influential in terms of how you grow up as a leader.

593
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:43,859
I love the opportunity to say that to Hawk Ruth, who, you know, I'm sure must be incredibly proud of you.

594
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,019
Yeah.

595
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:55,460
And a high school teacher who I'd love you to name as well on the chance that maybe it does get back to them, because it just shows you how they can be life changing, can't they? Someone just taking interest in you at the right period of time.

596
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,740
Oh, for sure. It's Bill Brent. He was my band director.

597
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:58,440
Yeah.

598
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:11,160
Yeah. I was a trombone player in high school, you know, and so he just took an active interest in everybody. And I was a leader in that organization. And he had very high standards. And I think that really stuck.

599
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,960
Yeah, life changing out of that influence in your life.

600
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:33,799
In the spirit of collaboration, my final question to you, Tim, and you've got this huge project underway and so many passions, it's clear in your life. Has there been someone you thought, I'd love to collaborate with that person on this particular project you're on or any other area of your life? Is there a name that springs to mind in terms of someone that stood out to you that you'd love to connect with?

601
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:42,400
You know, it would be really interesting to establish a relationship with Elon Musk to tap his brain because he sees things in a very unique way.

602
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:43,799
And he clearly has success.

603
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:57,980
He has success in so many different ways when it comes to space. He's really been the primary person, I think, that's transformed our access to space, which has opened up this market and is going to lead to that growth that you just talked about. That would be cool.

604
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:07,180
When you heard, Tim, that they were planning to re-land a rocket back on the launch pad, did you think this is crazy or we can do this?

605
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,860
No, I didn't think it was crazy. I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. He has a very motivated team and people are super excited.

606
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:41,340
NASA tried to do this back in the day with a program called the Delta Clipper. And NASA became risk-averse at certain points in its history. And that was one of those where they canceled that program. But, you know, someone who has lots of resources like he does and great motivation to accomplish great things are able to do things like reusable rockets. And like the pace at which they build and launch rockets is truly amazing. So we're excited to partner with them for Starship.

607
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,940
Tim, it's been a great honor and a great pleasure to meet you.

608
00:34:43,960 --> 00:35:03,480
And understand your history and share so openly your remarkable story and to understand more about just how important it is, the project you're on. It's great you're here in Australia. I'm sure it's going to motivate. We've already had one Australian astronaut spend some time in space. It's a small community, but I suspect more people listening to this are going to be inspired by what you've done. So thanks for taking the time.

609
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,480
Yeah, thank you, Luke. This is pretty great. Thank you.
