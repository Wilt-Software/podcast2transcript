00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,009
I hope you enjoyed this conversation on the Empowering Leaders podcast with Nathan Parris,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:15,070
an unbelievable Australian success story. Nathan's business, Emerge Capital, is responsible for many

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,769
of the biggest real estate transactions in Australia. I love this chat with Nathan. He

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,489
gives great advice for everyone considering the entrepreneurial path. He talks about the

5
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:29,489
untapped potential of empowering young people within your organisation and also how to get

6
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,670
incredible efficiency in your space to go through the roof when you get company culture right.

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,090
Worth hanging on to the very end of this podcast because Nathan talks about

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,530
his dinner party with former exiled Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and also his dealings

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,189
with the Walton family from Walmart fame, the richest family in America in their pursuit of

10
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:56,049
doing business in China. It's a fascinating conversation full of a lot of wisdom. Nathan

11
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,350
Parris has been a great champion for us in our Alita Connect groups.

12
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:04,989
Alita Connect is our bespoke facilitated leadership forum where we curate and bring

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:10,489
together diverse thinking in peer groups that support, share, learn and connect together.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,510
Nathan was generous enough to say in this conversation that Alita Connect

15
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,650
has literally changed his life. We love the idea of brilliant people coming together

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,230
and able to support each other in ways that perhaps they haven't before in peer groups that

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,150
we think are really, really powerful. We'd love to connect with you. Book a discovery call.

Thank you.

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,599
Thank you.

31
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:11,780

00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:12,699
Thank you.

35
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,639
Thank you.

36
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:13,659
Thank you.

37
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:13,719
Thank you.

38
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:13,759
Thank you.

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,060
Thank you.

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,139
Thank you.

41
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:14,180
Thank you.

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,620
Thank you.

43
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,819
Thank you.

44
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:14,939
Thank you.

45
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:15,360
Thank you.

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,139
Prior to this, Nathan had gathered a wealth of experience in roles for Capital Land in

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,860
Singapore, Morgan Stanley in Japan, the Torben Company in Hong Kong, and Lendlease in Australia.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,860
Nathan has a reputation for being humble, understated, and he's a unique leadership success story.

49
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,860
Nathan, it's a fascinating life that you've lived and an intriguing story. And it's fair

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,199
to say, pretty private person, took a bit of convincing to get you to the table today.

51
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,840
So firstly, I appreciate you taking the time to share your story.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:40,900
Thank you.

53
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:44,360
No, thank you very much, Luke. It's a real honour.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,560
You studied international business out of school. You had a dream that you wanted to

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,340
work overseas, but credit working in pubs while you're at uni with developing a lot

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,900
of the skills that have helped your success. Can you explain why that's the case?

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah, it's interesting. And I really do reflect a lot on the early part of my life in terms of I had

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,280
jobs that involved a lot of interaction with people. And so starting out in pubs,

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,939
obviously, when you're young, you don't quite appreciate that you're managing

60
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:22,360
intoxicated people most of the time. And you learn soft skills. And that's really stuck with me

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,219
really throughout my whole career, because at the end of the day, what I do more than anything else

62
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:34,460
is interact with people and try to influence positive outcomes. And so I really now reflect

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:40,139
on those years and appreciate that because I just can't imagine how I would have got to

64
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:40,259
where I am now. And so I really now reflect on those years and appreciate that because I just

65
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,280
can't imagine how I would have got to where I am now. And so I really now reflect on those years and

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,080
if it had not been for learning how to deal with people, and particularly in difficult situations.

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,860
That resonated with me a lot. I grew up in a family of publicans, and we used to live upstairs in the

68
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,340
old pubs back in the day and watch mum and dad working downstairs. And if we wanted to earn some

69
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,439
pocket money, you had to go and pick up glasses. But you're constantly around people. And literally,

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,379
the hospitality industry taught you, you had to say hello, and mum and dad were always on

71
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,180
to you to be hospitable if you were going to be part of the family.

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,120
And our kids have all worked as glassies, as part of a bit of a rite of passage. It's a good start

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,759
in life, isn't it? It's not a bad grounding to get going. It really is. And in fact, it's funny you

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,480
say that. I remember my first day working, it was Valentine's Day. It was a Friday night in a sort of

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,339
big pub in Brisbane called Friday's. And I was turned up in a bow tie, white shirt, black slacks.

76
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,160
So you had to, you know, you had to dress up. And my job was to basically look after a section. There's

77
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,579
probably a couple of thousand people in the pub slash club. And I had the toilets, the male

78
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:51,160
toilets. Never cleaned a toilet in my life. And I think in that first night, I had seen everything

79
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,399
that you could possibly see in a toilet. But you know, going forward, it was really the beginning

80
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,720
of then I had to clean the tables at the end of the night. And I was so fastidious about it. And

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,339
it just never left me to sort of take pride in my section. And then as you probably know,

82
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,639
you go from being a glassie to behind the bar.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,060
To being a manager. And it's almost a little career before you start your career. And as I said,

84
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,079
you are literally learning on the job. And it's almost like mini crisis management all the time.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,720
And I just, I literally couldn't imagine doing what I do today without that experience.

86
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,939
Mentioned the dream to work overseas. And you certainly realize that work dream pretty early

87
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,899
on in your life. And you go over to places like Taipei, the world's tallest building,

88
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,139
Taipei 101. You work on that. You become a fund manager and establish

89
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,120
Singapore's first ever real estate investment trust. You head on to Tokyo to work for Morgan

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Stanley. You've crammed an enormous amount into your life. You're not even 50 years of age yet.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,339
Can you tell us about the chapter working through Asia?

92
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,120
Yeah. I mean, look, it was a dream come true for me. There was no rhyme or reason why I studied

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,500
international business at university other than to get out of Brisbane. And it's not because I

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,579
don't like Brisbane. I just felt like I just had something in me to go and explore the world. And

95
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,120
I was very, very excited about it. And I was very, very excited about it. And I was very, very

96
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:16,800
fortunate to join an organization that one, got me out of Brisbane and into Melbourne as my first

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,220
job. But within three years, I was just given this incredibly unique opportunity, as you say,

98
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:32,000
to go to Taipei. And Taipei, this was back in 1999. So it wasn't really a market full of expats.

99
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,860
And my background was shopping centers or shopping malls. And we were building the podium of what was

100
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,240
what is now the world. Sorry, it was at the time the world's tallest building, Taipei 101. It was big

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,420
thinking. I'd never been around that environment where you're so bold in terms of the vision of

102
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,439
what you're trying to create. And at an early age, I had to really expand my mind to think about,

103
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:05,100
you know, the world of possibility. And I guess the big thing for me was really,

104
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,540
at that point, learning to work in a cross-cultural environment,

105
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,639
which I've got to say, as a young guy, nothing prepared me for that.

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,899
The organization I worked for didn't prepare me, not that that was their fault, but you literally

107
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,379
got dropped in. You know, you've got language barriers, you've got cultural barriers,

108
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:32,319
and you do things differently as well. So it was a baptism of fire. But at the same time,

109
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,839
it was just, it was like living on another planet. And it was the sensory experience was just unreal.

110
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,980
Unimaginable, because growing up in, in Brisbane, you just, you just could never have imagined that

111
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,720
there was a world like that. And then as you say, then sort of things move start quite quickly,

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,699
because what I realized being a young expatriate is you are a minority. And so therefore,

113
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:05,639
opportunities come fast at you. And, and I really took advantage of that. You know,

114
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,639
I think you commented there, I joined an organization called,

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,459
Capital Land, and we established the first real estate investment trust, which was

116
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:20,459
massive, because it completely transformed the real estate industry in Asia. Now, where there's

117
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,480
hundreds of billions of dollars of funds under management in these real estate investment trusts.

118
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,639
And I was a 26 year old guy, I had some credentials that happened to suit that organization. Next

119
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,679
thing I know, I'm on global roadshows, raising capital from, you know, large foreign institutional

120
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,840
investors. And, you know, I've just seen there the whole time, pinching my fingers,

121
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,059
pinching myself going, you know, how did I land this, but then equally, you know, really being

122
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,940
challenged, and at times really struggling with the cross cultural element. And again, that

123
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,220
experience a bit like talking about the pub experience has stuck with me and really is a

124
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,460
massive factor in terms of, you know, where I am today, and where the business that I run is today,

125
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,500
because, you know, we specialize now in cross border investment from overseas,

126
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,700
to Australian real estate. And you think of the unique experiences that you've been able to

127
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,019
gather and Singapore's reputation as a country without many natural resources at all, but had

128
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,679
to find a way to be pioneers in spaces like you. And as a 26, 27 year old, to be at the front of

129
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,240
that is quite remarkable. And, and then you go to Japan, and you read a lot about the work culture

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,039
in Japan of no work life balance at all, and 80 to 100 hour weeks, and you get swept up in that.

131
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,340
And, and, and, you know, I hear you,

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,700
talk about that, giving you these elite work habits, but maybe teaching you to be a workaholic.

133
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,740
Is that something that's still part of you that you've got to manage a little bit working too hard?

134
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,259
Yeah, it was that I mean, going to Japan and joining, you know, Morgan Stanley,

135
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:00,019
and at that time, when I joined them, they were the most successful global real estate investor.

136
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:04,759
They were certainly the largest foreign real estate investor in Japan. And they were doing

137
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,259
very, very substantial deals, and making the firm and its

138
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,860
investors a lot of money. And it was a tempo that that just smacked you in the face like you did,

139
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:23,059
you turn up and the is just real time management. And I never really had that in my career. Obviously,

140
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:27,019
I, you know, as as what they call a lateral hire, because I didn't start as a graduate,

141
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:34,639
I had subject matter expertise in the areas that they wanted to pursue in Japan. But yeah,

142
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,200
this this tempo was it was almost like, what I would describe as,

143
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:48,019
perfect rhythm. Everyone knew their role. Everyone was smart. And, and everyone got out got on and

144
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,600
you almost opted out, if you couldn't keep up. And I saw that with people like, you know, just

145
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,340
literally opting out because you were just exposed if you couldn't, if you couldn't keep going.

146
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:06,200
And for me, it was I call it sort of my PhD, not even an MBA, because I had to lift. And you know,

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,440
had to push hard and, and, and, you know, discover things.

148
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,240
Things that I, you know, didn't know that I was capable of. And I was very fortunate to work with

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,299
some not only really bright people, but just some genuinely amazing people who, to this day,

150
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:26,360
I consider as good friends, and have gone on to be just ridiculously successful. You know,

151
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,500
I loved it. I really did enjoy that experience. As I said, it did turn me into quite an elite

152
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,440
professional. And I realised that there was no limits to what you can do.

153
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,039
Particularly in a good team environment. And I, you know, as you know, Das, I participate in a

154
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:52,340
couple of the elite groups. And, and I actually recognise similar patterns in, you know, some of

155
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,940
the peers in my group, that those that are elite athletes. And it's interesting how I observed that,

156
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:07,100
you know, there is a very high level of crossover between, you know, business and, and, and athletes,

157
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,120
professional athletes.

158
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,440
And so,

159
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,820
you know, and then your overlay, as you touched on, just the cross-cultural element of that,

160
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:20,480
working in Japan. I mean, it is one of the most interesting, but challenging environments to work

161
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,340
in from a, from a cross-cultural perspective. And you're working for an elite American organisation

162
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,860
that has very high standards. And not that they were unforgiving, but, but, you know,

163
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,240
you needed to deliver, which required an enormous influence over, you know,

164
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,440
the Japanese members in your team, or even, you know, the people that you're interacting,

165
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,039
emerging outside of that business, but, you know, it, it was an amazing opportunity.

166
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,980
And, and to your point about, you know, it did see me into a workaholic and as I said, it uncovered

167
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,519
aspects in, in my sort of personality that, that lives with me today.

168
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,659
And I would dearly love to sort of figure out how I can unpick some of those

169
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,960
aspects, but, but, you know, if I'm brutally honest, I wouldn't be where I am today,

170
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,600
certainly that experience to know how hard you can push yourself we're looking forward to coming back

171
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,960
and talking about our shared passion for the elita groups that we're really uh wrapped that you're

172
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,220
part of but it sounds to me looking at your story that you you you go really hard and and you've got

173
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,419
this capacity to push yourself and as you said you you get into an elite environment morgan stanley

174
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:33,360
and you you can find that level but then it seems like your life has had a number of sabbaticals

175
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,639
along the way where you go okay i'm going to take the time right out now and including

176
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,899
putting yourself into a mai tai kickboxing camp in phuket as part of a sabbatical what were you

177
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,860
thinking there tell us about that one um look you know uh having this conversation with you sort of

178
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,440
made me realize to some extent at the time how i was quite self-centered um you know it was all

179
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,139
about my career me and as a result of that i you know it i never got into very serious relationships

180
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,620
um because i just prioritized

181
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,580
my work over everything and i didn't quite appreciate that that was the case at the time

182
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,539
but it certainly resonated with me as i was sort of getting towards the end of my career in asia

183
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,279
and i remember having a conversation with my mother and she said look you know we're very

184
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,460
proud of you we we love what you're doing but do you think there might be a little bit more to life

185
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,220
than what you are doing and it was a period uh you know certainly in asia leading up to the gfc where

186
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,019
you know there was just a lot of money

187
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,220
there was just a lot of money and there was a lot of very hedonistic um times and experiences

188
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,539
and it took for about six months almost like water finding its way through a rock in my brain from

189
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:54,259
what my mother said and i thought you know what it's time to move on i've been blessed to have

190
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:59,299
this incredible career and opportunities that i was afforded in my time in asia and

191
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:06,740
i knew that i had to detox and not not detox from from alcohol or anything like that it was just

192
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:14,120
from the lifestyle and uh and i ran into this guy in hong kong one night and he told me that he'd

193
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,120
spent time in a in a thai muay thai um kickboxing camp um in phuket and i'd done a little bit of

194
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,279
that when i was younger a bit of boxing and that really resonated with me i thought this is what i

195
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:36,820
need jesus it's amazing how you know life is a sliding door moments and um so i resigned um i

196
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,179
had a chance to go to phuket in thailand and next thing i know i'm training five hours a day

197
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:51,460
and just literally getting the shit kicked out of me and i was i was old by those standards you

198
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,500
know most of the guys there were in their late teens early 20s you know from all over the world

199
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,419
they're pretty elite um and um and you know honestly i found it a little bit boring because

200
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,620
it's so monotonous when you're doing the same thing over and over again and i guess that's

201
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:14,279
the sport right that's what you got to do muscle memory um so now i was doing that and um look it

202
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,580
was working in terms of the detoxification of the of the lifestyle but um you know it was

203
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:29,919
similarly it was actually valentine's day again in 2009 and it was it was raining outside and

204
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:36,179
tropical rain in thailand and um and the water was spraying onto the canvas where i was sparring

205
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:37,620
with my trainers

206
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,200
who happened to be like an ex-world champion kickboxer and i was a boxer right i got quite

207
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:51,919
heavy legs um and uh so i i didn't kick a lot and uh anyway just did a sweep kick and uh my

208
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,960
body's gone one way my leg's gone the other and my knee fully dislocated and fortunately you'd

209
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,440
appreciate this being an ex-afl player remember watching a sydney swan player do it on on on um

210
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,339
in a game and he punched his knee back in and they're incredible

211
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,160
that was famously yeah i remember that very well yeah slap your kneecap back in after it was

212
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,859
dislocated yeah yeah mine was a kneecap mine was a sort of the full dislocation in any event

213
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,799
i just started punching it and my trainer had the presence of mind to lift my leg up

214
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,400
for some reason it went back in and and he said to me oh nathan that's okay why don't you just do

215
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,660
you know 500 knees and you know the corner of the ring and his name was pot and i said pot i don't

216
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,599
think you understand like you know my knees buggered and then he said oh that's okay then

217
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,519
you know why don't you just go and do 500 sit-ups and meanwhile my knee is just swelling up quite

218
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:49,359
badly but fast forward the story um had a full knee reconstruction torn acl torn meniscus and

219
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,859
because of insurance reasons i spent the next few months in in rehabilitation but that dust was what

220
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:02,099
basically brought me back down to earth um so it's amazing you know i see silver linings now

221
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:07,180
because i've i've had that much disappointment challenge all those things in life um at the

222
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,940
appreciate that was a silver lining but but that that was it and that was what was the catalyst for

223
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,460
the change in my next part of my career well i love sharing stories like yours nathan and appreciate

224
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,799
you doing it so openly because you always read the headlines and you think you know what a blessed

225
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,960
life and and nathan paris life comes easy to nathan he's you know having huge success and

226
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,700
running this extraordinary business but you don't really understand along the way the serious hurdles

227
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,480
that are there tearing your acl and your meniscus is a way to teach you to come back to earth a

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,380
little bit but you also shared with me that you know you went to hochman city did some gold futures

229
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,019
trading that didn't end so well and effectively for all that brilliant experience in asia 35 years

230
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:52,660
of age you come back home to australia and you're back living with your mom and dad i'm assuming

231
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,779
that's a pretty humbling experience as well yeah look it was it was surreal you know you you go

232
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:04,059
from being you know probably not the right description but a high flyer you know you'd

233
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,880
you know you've come back down to earth and then you've realized you've got to get to it you know

234
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,180
the funds over as sabbaticals i'm a big believer in um you know i think i've had three years off

235
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,299
in my career the sabbaticals um but you've got to get you've got to get to it and look you know

236
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,400
one of the things that i now recognize that i didn't at the time is an innate you know ambition

237
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,460
that i have and drive again another characteristic that i see in my peers in in the groups i'm doing

238
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,819
um and uh and i you know it's professionally the hardest thing i've ever done was incredibly

239
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:49,660
humbling people you know go you know great to see you nathan but you know there's no job

240
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,299
and uh you know took me you know i'd gone from being headhunted for every role i'd ever had

241
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:02,980
um and and going up the curve and and now it was no no no no no and actually on a you know

242
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,720
snakes and ladders falling to the bottom and starting all over again

243
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,559
i was just so determined it was almost like something had over like overcome me and um i

244
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,660
even reflect on it and just can't believe how hungry i was um and what i again silver lining

245
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,359
and all of that at the time there was so much disappointment but what i was doing

246
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:32,240
was creating a network and and that network is actually what served me when i then went on to do

247
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,000
my own thing but i didn't appreciate that at the time and nor could have i ever appreciated but

248
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,400
to me as i often do for career advice and what they should do when they should stay or leave

249
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,140
their job i always say use this as an opportunity to go out and connect and network and that's what

250
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,920
you've done you decided that the corporate world and the politics of that wasn't necessarily for

251
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,440
you but still a big leap of faith isn't it to go down the entrepreneurial path and put it all on

252
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,319
the line and say okay i'm not working for morgan stanley anymore it's it's nathan paris and i'm

253
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,819
going to do it myself and and the end result you know emerged capital

254
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,920
largest real estate transactions in australia it's an extraordinary australian business success

255
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,420
story but to those listening that are thinking about taking that jump what's your advice to

256
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:24,220
to the next entrepreneur uh well first i'd just say just do it i i i don't know if you've heard

257
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,319
of this sort of concept of limerence it's like you know when people get into a relationship they

258
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,200
they don't see any of the negative stuff you know like i often use the expression you can

259
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,480
kiss each other without brushing your teeth and it doesn't you know you don't

260
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,940
it feels good and then you know two years later you just and if you knew what you were getting

261
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:52,359
into in small business um you know you really knew you wouldn't do it in saying that you know

262
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:59,480
it's just profoundly satisfying the one thing i value more than anything is the independence

263
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,819
to wake up every day and to truly know that you control your own destiny and i find that

264
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,359
liberating um that you can actually have an idea and you can act on that idea and you can do that

265
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:20,140
obviously in an organization but you really need to be skilled and that's you know as you mentioned

266
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,400
sort of about politics and stuff like that i i found it highly frustrating because i want to do

267
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,859
because i'm more of a doer than a thinker and uh and i'd always come up against sort of you

268
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,339
know internal challenges for whatever reason but you know with a business that that you lead

269
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:45,099
and if you sort of get turned on by the idea of you know um doing what you think you want to do

270
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:50,539
it's it's just so empowering but i don't read a lot but i remember reading elon musk's book

271
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,920
years ago and he said being an entrepreneur is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss

272
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:03,819
because you just now now like you know fast forward god what is it you know 12 years

273
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,559
i used to sort of go oh why me why is this happening

274
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,559
to me and all of that now it's sort of a bit sadistic like you go okay where's the challenge

275
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,599
like you know this is all going too well i'm waiting for something to go wrong because you

276
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:23,079
know that's that's what it's about and and that's where i come back to that point around silver

277
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:29,880
linings i'm now convinced in every difficult situation there is definitely if you're putting

278
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,480
everything into it um something positive will come out of it whether it's at that time or in

279
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,319
the future because if you're putting the effort in

280
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,940
and you're doing your best to put your effort in something inevitably comes out of that but

281
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:49,480
it's been so rewarding but it's been bloody tough and uh and i would just as this why i come back to

282
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,559
your question just just do it and um it's going to be hard it's a common thing now that i i'm

283
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,240
fascinated to hear that a lot people that have got to the sustained success level you know like

284
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,319
you have with emerged capital and they look back at the the fights and the struggles is almost the

285
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,619
most joyful time because you're in solution mode and you're in the moment and you're in the moment

286
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,500
you're coming up with ideas and you're meeting great people and you're putting it out there and

287
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,380
i think when you talk to anyone who's at the startup phase all they want is the sustained

288
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,680
success period so it is interesting you're chasing uh that regularly and you've mentioned uh very

289
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,559
generously a leader which is the entrepreneurial space that matt whatowitz and i are incredibly

290
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:31,220
passionate about um we've been really privileged to to connect with you and and love your story

291
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,059
and you're one of the great legends of our space because you're so curious and love learning that

292
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,839
and for those that are listening you've heard me talk about it before you know we've uh emerged

293
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,680
into these bespoke groups of five or six different people and nathan brings your story you've just

294
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,339
heard before like a unique wealth of experience i said before we start i feel like it's a shantaram

295
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:57,200
style uh story and you talked about living in india for a period of time as well but uh to me

296
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,880
bringing your thinking alongside elite sports people and i'm sure the guys won't mind me

297
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,000
mentioning who's uh who you collaborate with leon camera is one of my great friends in life the 10

298
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,619
year coach at gws and i'm sure you've heard a lot of people talk about how they've been

299
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,839
uh i'm biased but one of the great people uh i've ever met one of my closest friends ivan cleary who's

300
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,660
just got a remarkable reputation in rugby league gus warren you don't meet a more beautiful guy

301
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,240
than gus with gotcha for life and he's just doing incredible work jack trengove is just a special

302
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,480
person as well in in that group youngest ever captain of melbourne but what he's doing with

303
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,680
his finance world and then the second group uh he's equally fascinating for me zach merritt the

304
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,619
captain of essen and james tedesco an nrl legend manis labashane kurt zerber who was one of the

305
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,480
senior executives from westpac bank it's a fascinating uh thing can you tell us what

306
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,859
you get out of it and why it's been a good thing for you oh look darce it's it's been immense

307
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:56,619
it's been life-changing for me um you know i i do need to thank leon and and yourself and

308
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:04,039
matt for giving me the opportunity to participate uh it was sort of surreal um you know as i said

309
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,160
most of the members in those groups are elite sports people

310
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,279
you start out thinking what do i have in common with these people

311
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,519
you know am i going to be able to participate at all and uh you know you fast forward to today

312
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,380
and it's it is arguably one of the most gratifying experiences that i've had

313
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:31,859
uh first my first comment is that you know being a business owner at times can be lonely um you know

314
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,500
i've got a lot of industry peers as i'm sure probably you do darce from your playing days and

315
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,240
you've got lots of friends and peers from that.

316
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,740
But what I really have struggled with in my career as a business owner

317
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,660
is a peer group and a peer group just to share.

318
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:53,039
And I actually recall listening to a podcast with you

319
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,720
and Stacey Morlinson, she was sort of summing it up around

320
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,359
that you're talking to a peer group that have no bearing

321
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,839
on your day-to-day life.

322
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:04,880
And that is powerful because you're just genuinely there

323
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
to help each other, to listen, to learn from each other.

324
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,319
You know, this environment, because it's so trusting,

325
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,420
it's just full of nuggets.

326
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,880
And you're lifted every time you have one of these conversations.

327
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,839
And that's just given me a lot of confidence

328
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,480
that we're all in the same boat.

329
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,740
It doesn't matter whether you're in real estate,

330
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,579
you're an elite sports person, you're a senior executive

331
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,640
in one of Australia's largest banks, you know,

332
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,859
we all walk the same path.

333
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,940
We all breathe the same earth, we all breathe the same air,

334
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,519
we drink the same water, and we've all got the same problems.

335
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,140
You know, and equally, we've all got similar aspirations

336
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,119
to be better people.

337
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,059
And so, you know, it's been a real eye-opener for me

338
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,220
and I can't believe that it took to be my age to be able

339
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,259
to connect with peers like that and to be able to share

340
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,099
so openly and I keep coming back to a very trusting environment.

341
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,839
So, no, I would go so far as to say it's just,

342
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,519
it's changed my life.

343
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,220
It's very generous of you to say that, Nathan.

344
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,579
And I look at the sort of the wheel of life and you think

345
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,599
you've got these incredible skill sets that show up

346
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,779
when you talk about your story and consistently able

347
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,640
to do things that other people find really hard.

348
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,119
But like all of us, there's the deficiencies, isn't there,

349
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,619
that we're all trying to fill to make sure that life

350
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,059
is balanced and happy and successful.

351
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,059
And when you put diverse thinking together,

352
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,279
you often get clues on how to balance that out.

353
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,759
Athletes, genuinely, that was,

354
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,960
my life as a kid all I wanted to do.

355
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,420
But we often, as a group, struggle financially

356
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,680
to get the decisions that probably come easy to you.

357
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,140
And so that shared economy and then obviously the discipline

358
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,759
and the team aspect and putting back in and taking feedback

359
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,460
and working in a team is something that probably comes easy

360
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
to us because that's our grounding.

361
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,200
So, you know, we love the fact that then you get brilliant

362
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,440
female leaders in who see the world in such a beautiful way.

363
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,700
And I think it's great that that's been,

364
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,980
what it has for you.

365
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,160
And I think you've described it, isn't it,

366
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,019
the different thinking actually can be a bit life-changing at times.

367
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,980
Yeah, look, I mean, what it's taught me is just, again,

368
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,960
the world of possibility of sharing.

369
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,480
I actually think that it's a catalyst to something else.

370
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,920
You know, it certainly piqued some curiosity in me in terms

371
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,019
of getting fulfilment out of things beyond what we do day to day.

372
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,279
And so, you know, it's something that I'm keen

373
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,240
to explore further because I've now realised

374
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,660
that I'm not going to be able to do it.

375
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,720
I'm not going to be able to do it.

376
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:34,839
I'm not going to be able to do it.

377
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:34,859
I'm not going to be able to do it.

378
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,980
You know, there's that possibility outside of, you know,

379
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,059
what I've been doing.

380
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:41,660
And, you know, I go back to being a business owner.

381
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,259
Well, it's not lonely.

382
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,019
So, you know, I don't mean it like that.

383
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,900
But the lack of ability to share about your journey

384
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,460
and not to talk about what you do because that's sort

385
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,519
of the technical aspect.

386
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,380
But I just genuinely feel like through sharing

387
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,059
with a peer group, it just opens up, as I said before,

388
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,440
this world of possibility.

389
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,839
And I'm very, very...

390
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,299
I'm very keen to explore that further.

391
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,759
And one of the things that, you know, I've been discussing

392
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,539
in one of our groups is just sort of like, you know,

393
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,940
there's a book that Matt shared was, you know,

394
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,720
The Second Mountain.

395
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,819
Where to now?

396
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,160
So firstly, you know, you have a corporate career,

397
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,180
then you have the business owning career and you sort

398
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,259
of go, okay, well, what's the next stage of fulfilment?

399
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,880
And in my view, that is definitely giving back.

400
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,940
And that's, I think, the enjoyment out of being

401
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,559
in these groups.

402
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,480
Given your life history and story,

403
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,740
that second mountain will be fascinating.

404
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,039
I guarantee it won't be boring given the way you've

405
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,920
approached life.

406
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,160
And I'm looking forward to asking these questions

407
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,779
because we do think success leaves clues and to see it turn

408
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,140
up in a story like yours and your language you speak

409
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,319
about in such a clear way.

410
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,880
And as you would know, talk about self-leadership a lot

411
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
and that idea that you don't get to run a merged capital

412
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,859
and have a business like yours without a sense

413
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,440
of what self-leadership means.

414
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,420
Can you describe that for you?

415
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,200
Yeah.

416
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,700
I was very lucky.

417
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,099
The founding partner of the firm that I now run was the most

418
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:13,740
brilliant person that I've ever met.

419
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,220
He was young at the time, one of the brightest,

420
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,160
if not the brightest person that I'd ever met,

421
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,319
just believed that you could do anything.

422
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,559
But quite literally, it wasn't just like a, it wasn't rhetoric.

423
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,180
It was just like, just do.

424
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,180
And what I learnt was that you can do anything,

425
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,880
but particularly if you have young,

426
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,180
bright people, and I didn't quite appreciate this

427
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,279
because I didn't have high intellect as a student,

428
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,339
but if you've got young, really bright people

429
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:47,460
that are curious and conscientious,

430
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,359
you can literally do anything.

431
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,359
In terms of leadership, certainly what I've learnt is if you,

432
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,740
and this is a very commonly used word,

433
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,079
but I just sort of mean it when I say it,

434
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,180
but when you empower young, bright people,

435
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,059
it is just scary what they can do.

436
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,700
And so, you know, we work in this,

437
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,519
what I think is very unique environment because as you touched on,

438
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:19,059
when I left corporate, I wanted to create a safe environment

439
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,500
free of politics so that people could say what they wanted to say

440
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,140
as a question or a statement and feel comfortable saying it

441
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,119
because what I'd observed is that if they do that,

442
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,119
their confidence grows quickly and they begin,

443
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,099
they begin to discover that they can evolve their skills

444
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,099
and thinking at a rapid rate.

445
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:42,599
And as a result of that, talk about leadership,

446
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,000
I mean, I lead a group of very young,

447
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,400
elite people that exceed their expectations almost on a weekly basis.

448
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,400
And I believe, you know, and I think if I were to sort of talk about

449
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,759
what have I uncovered as being a leader and an owner of a business,

450
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,759
which is the untapped potential in these young people,

451
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,759
given the right environment and the right opportunities.

452
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:18,259
And as a result of that, you then get invigorated by them.

453
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:23,259
And it just spreads beyond your organisation.

454
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:26,559
I often reflect on this and I haven't landed on,

455
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,859
is it a formula?

456
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,160
Is this something that others do?

457
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,059
I wouldn't know.

458
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,460
It'd be worthwhile actually having a conversation in my leader groups

459
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:33,960
about it.

460
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,660
But, you know, I just think, Darce, that's something that I value immensely.

461
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,660
I don't know if I'd be a good leader of peers, to be honest,

462
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,859
if I'm really honest with you, but certainly young people,

463
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:50,160
I just get maximum fulfilment out of seeing them reach their potential

464
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,359
because I do believe that they have untapped potential.

465
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,259
Yeah, so much wisdom in that, Nathan.

466
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,359
I love you sharing it.

467
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,859
You know, someone said to me recently, you don't build a great business,

468
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:03,359
you actually...

469
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,960
Yeah.

470
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,159
...find these incredible people and then they build it with you or for you

471
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,960
or collaborate with you.

472
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,760
And we've seen that in our own space.

473
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,159
You know, Matt Waterwood, who you know really well,

474
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,260
who's a great friend of mine, an incredible partner

475
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,760
and just does things incredibly well.

476
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,760
But he's had the foresight to find these brilliant people.

477
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,860
And you've met Stacey and Marlee and Steph,

478
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,960
who've joined us in recent times as well.

479
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,159
It was so much smarter than me.

480
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,860
Talk about being invigorated by people.

481
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,360
You just, you actually want to be better for them

482
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,559
because you can see the bar so high and it resonates so strongly.

483
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,059
And I'm not surprised to hear you articulate it in that way.

484
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,059
And that sort of leads to having a positive impact on people.

485
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,460
When you bring young people into your environment,

486
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,159
I'm assuming on a daily basis,

487
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,960
you've got a consciousness around how you impact them positively.

488
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,659
Yeah, look, I mean, it's a...

489
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,159
But I've got to be really honest to us, it's a brutal environment.

490
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,960
I'd say that in a positive context, on a negative context,

491
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,760
but it's not for everyone.

492
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,659
You know, a lot of the lessons that I learned in my career, I apply,

493
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:06,659
to what we do, we, you know, we work on very serious stuff.

494
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:10,860
And I wake up every day and never, ever take that for granted

495
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,760
in terms of the opportunities that we're afforded.

496
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,460
Like I literally just cannot believe sometimes the things that we get to do

497
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,260
and we're trusted to do.

498
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,460
And so I take that just so seriously.

499
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,360
And as a result, I embed that in the team literally every minute of the day.

500
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,460
But this culture of, you know, being direct,

501
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:36,659
but having no, there's no malice in being direct,

502
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,059
but it is highly confrontational.

503
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,260
And as I said, it's not for everyone.

504
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,860
But at the same time, because it's not personal,

505
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,260
we're always picking up the team members each day

506
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,760
and making sure that, you know, it's understood that it's not personal.

507
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,860
But when you can actually crack through that,

508
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,159
and that becomes your, the way, you know, your operating rhythm,

509
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,960
your efficiency goes through the roof.

510
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,460
It's like a vertical curve.

511
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,159
Because you're not trying to have to explain things.

512
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,659
You say what you mean.

513
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:11,159
If you're not saying it fast enough, you'll be sped up to get to the point.

514
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:15,159
And then we thrash out, we will rigorously debate.

515
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,659
If you weren't part of our organisation,

516
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:21,260
you'd find that it was almost offensive the way that we talk to each other.

517
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,460
Not in terms of language, but like, what do you mean?

518
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,960
That doesn't make sense.

519
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
You know, say what you mean.

520
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,460
And then what happens is this, just this beautiful sort of cycle of ideas,

521
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,460
comes out of it, and it gets tested at a rapid rate.

522
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,460
And then all of a sudden, you've got a solution.

523
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,760
And so, as I said, it's not for everyone.

524
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,559
But those guys that are in the team that can handle it, thrive in it.

525
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,059
And then they create that culture for the next generation

526
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,760
that comes through the organisation.

527
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Because we're literally plucking kids out of university.

528
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,659
Yeah, it's brilliant.

529
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:59,960
And the sporting analogy is alive and well, for me,

530
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,460
isn't the best teams I've played in, you know, if you looked at the,

531
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,460
on the field, you haven't got time.

532
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,960
So, the conversations are as direct and as clear,

533
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,460
but always done with respect because you have that expectation of each other.

534
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,760
And that does translate to then off the field,

535
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,360
you just give and receive feedback instantaneously,

536
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,059
because you know you live and die by your teammates.

537
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,159
It sounds like that's, you know, in a world I don't understand,

538
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,159
but it's a highly competitive world, isn't it?

539
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,059
The world of real estate.

540
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:31,659
And to be good, I'm assuming you have to be at the cutting edge all the time.

541
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:32,360
Yeah.

542
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:32,860
Yeah, you do.

543
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,659
I mean, look, you know, these are billion dollar plus projects

544
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,760
and investments that we oversee and, you know,

545
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,659
require like hundreds, if not thousands of decisions to,

546
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:51,860
you know, make these investments successful.

547
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,460
And so, as a result, it's relentless.

548
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,860
And, you know, we go back to, you know, that sort of the workaholic phase

549
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,760
and sort of, you know, the pursuit of excellence.

550
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,960
I mean, you just can't stop.

551
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:12,360
And, but again, if you, if you push hard and you use your smarts,

552
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
it's amazing the outcomes that you can achieve.

553
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,960
As I go back to that point, I believe that there is a solution for everything.

554
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,360
You just got to, you just got to put it through the,

555
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
you know, the filter or not even the filter.

556
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,960
You just got to, you just got to smash it and there'll be a nugget in there.

557
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,659
And so we see ladies are really conscious.

558
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,860
How they go about creating and sharing a vision

559
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,960
and understanding a bit more of your story to do these transactions

560
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,260
across different continents and different languages.

561
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,559
And to do that successfully is a pretty bold vision.

562
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,059
I mean, how have you gone about, you know,

563
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,159
we got a bit of an insight into how the team communicate,

564
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,760
but how have you gone about sharing and creating that vision?

565
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,860
Yeah, look, it's interesting.

566
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,860
The opportunity to do what we do came about,

567
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:07,460
really when I came back to Australia and I realized like one of the things,

568
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,460
you know, a lot of us don't appreciate is how attractive Australia is as an investment destination.

569
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,559
You know, from a sovereign risk perspective,

570
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:21,360
we rank amongst the highest in the world in terms of our GDP and GDP per capita.

571
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,760
We're one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

572
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,159
It's just a great place to do business and particularly invest in real estate.

573
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,659
I also realize that at the time,

574
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:35,860
our competitors didn't really talk to each other cross-border.

575
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,260
So they might have a business in Australia or businesses or offices throughout the world,

576
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,760
but often they didn't communicate effectively with each other.

577
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,159
And so I sort of really tapped into that and,

578
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,760
you know, I guess had this vision of,

579
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,059
you know, facilitating cross-border investment into Australia

580
00:39:55,059 --> 00:40:01,460
and really leveraging all of my institutional experience because it's a certain language in a way that you speak,

581
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,860
to institutions versus privates or individuals like you and I,

582
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,960
and that was my background.

583
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,559
And so, you know, I think in the early days,

584
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,260
it was definitely trial and error and just believing and turning up every day.

585
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,860
And, you know, I look at some of our former credential packs and you just go far out.

586
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,059
We're really, really sort of, you know,

587
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,760
it was a long bow we were drawing back then.

588
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
That's what you do, right? To get ahead.

589
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,059
But now I think the vision is really clear.

590
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:31,360
You know, we've got such a strong,

591
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,260
track record as you touched on,

592
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,059
you know, over $30 billion in transactions.

593
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,360
The team, because we're,

594
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,159
you know, we've got a lot on,

595
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,860
they understand intrinsically what we do.

596
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
I think the big thing,

597
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,960
Das, when I think about vision,

598
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,460
and we only spoke about this as a team last week,

599
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,360
was how do we take what we've done and how do we build on that?

600
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,860
Because I almost feel like, not that we're complacent,

601
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,960
but, you know, organizations evolve.

602
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,159
It's like me talking about being in your leader groups.

603
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,860
I sit there and I think, well, this is incredibly powerful.

604
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,260
Where do you take that?

605
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,460
And so similar sort of situation for our business.

606
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,460
I sit there and go, got this incredible team,

607
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,960
got this incredible track record.

608
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,460
We've got, you know, incredible relationships and all these things.

609
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,159
And I now ponder, what is the vision?

610
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,860
Is it more of the same, which there's nothing wrong with that,

611
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,360
or is it more of the same, which there's nothing wrong with that?

612
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,460
Or is it more of the same, which there's nothing wrong with that?

613
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,760
Or is it more of the same, which there's nothing wrong with that?

614
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,159
Or, you know, is there something that we can tap into?

615
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,960
Because markets change, you know,

616
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,760
we're heading into some pretty big headwinds, I think.

617
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,360
And so how do we adapt?

618
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,659
Because we've had one of the best cycles,

619
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:49,059
certainly from a real estate perspective in history.

620
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:51,559
But, you know, things like rising interest rates

621
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,460
are starting to cause some pain and we're going to have to adapt.

622
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,360
So for me now, it's thinking about the vision.

623
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
And then as a team,

624
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,659
how we set that vision and importantly,

625
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,260
because we're doers, importantly,

626
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,559
I just think about how does that translate into an executable strategy

627
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,960
that you can, like we have to-do lists and they're very long

628
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,360
and we go through them because we action everything.

629
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,559
We're all about execution.

630
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,159
And that leads to curiosity,

631
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,659
which we see shows up a lot in these conversations.

632
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:26,860
And through curiosity, it's that constant learning and development.

633
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,460
You can hear that in your world, isn't it?

634
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,360
You know, the world's changing.

635
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,159
What do we do next?

636
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,059
How do we continue to get better?

637
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:36,260
Is that thought of curiosity something that resonates with you?

638
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,360
Oh, absolutely.

639
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,659
But, you know, I'll be very honest with you.

640
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,659
And I've had this my whole career in a way,

641
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:43,960
and probably everyone does,

642
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,360
but I initially approach it with fear.

643
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,460
You know, even just talking to you about it,

644
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,159
sort of like makes me sort of nervous

645
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,559
because you don't know where to start, right?

646
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,159
And then we all know to start,

647
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,960
it's been like I told you when I came back to Australia,

648
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
I had to find a job where you start by making phone calls

649
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,760
and meeting people and, you know, all of that.

650
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,559
So, yeah, it makes me nervous and, you know, fearful of what if it,

651
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,260
you know, what if it doesn't work and all of those sorts of things.

652
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,960
But I guess, hey, that's if you reflect on your life

653
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,360
and as you and I have had several careers,

654
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,659
that's how it all starts.

655
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,460
And it's probably a good feeling to have

656
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,159
because if you didn't have that,

657
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,659
then you'd just be probably too comfortable.

658
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:29,460
And I think it's great that you get to share that.

659
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,659
And I certainly feel the same way, isn't it?

660
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,360
That just because you've achieved a level of success

661
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,659
doesn't mean that that doesn't bubble up in all of us, does it?

662
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,659
To think, you know, can I keep doing it?

663
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,960
What can happen next?

664
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,960
And what does the next chapter in the second mountain look like?

665
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,260
It's, you know, I certainly feel that the same way.

666
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,059
I've been doing a certain role in sort of mainstream media calling footy.

667
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,960
There's other passions that are there,

668
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,760
but that always burning, you know, touch of,

669
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,059
can we actually make this work?

670
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:00,360
Keeps you alive, doesn't it?

671
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
You don't always like the uncomfortable part of it,

672
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,260
but it keeps you getting out of bed, doesn't it?

673
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,760
I mean, you asked my wife.

674
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,860
I mean, there's no better person than I'm sure,

675
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:15,260
you know, a lot of us are similar that lives and breathes it.

676
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,559
It's intense.

677
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:20,860
And, you know, it can be a curse,

678
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,159
but also it's your greatest strength.

679
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,860
You know, as I think I've said to you,

680
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,460
it's in some ways getting comfortable with it

681
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,559
and being able to turn it off as well.

682
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,460
And again, that's something that I've spoken about in my leader groups,

683
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,460
but at the same time,

684
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,659
it's just this burn that you have inside you,

685
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:42,260
but that's who we are, right?

686
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,360
But at my age now,

687
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,360
I've got to learn hopefully some tools

688
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,960
or hacks as Matt or Stacey would say to try and also,

689
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,360
you know, manage that because,

690
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,860
you know, I think as I shared with you prior to this call,

691
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,460
when you have a business or when you set,

692
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,360
the direction,

693
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,860
you know, you can take things wherever you want to go.

694
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,260
And if you understand the power of that,

695
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,960
it's just bloody cool.

696
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,059
But you know, there are consequences to that as well.

697
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:15,559
We've heard a bit about your communication

698
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,460
and the other formula of being really direct and clear

699
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,159
and you know, an outsider coming in might almost find it offensive.

700
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,760
I mean, you've obviously put some thought into communicating with clarity.

701
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,559
Can you share a bit more on that?

702
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,360
Yeah, look, I mean, I think for me,

703
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,960
I was very, very lucky.

704
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,059
I've worked under some great communicators

705
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:37,760
and it was embedded in me quite,

706
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,559
or instilled in me at quite a young age,

707
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,860
the importance of communication and,

708
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,059
you know, we go back to those early jobs,

709
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:48,260
go back to the cross-cultural element.

710
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,059
I mean, I had to reinvent the way I spoke

711
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:52,460
because I'm a Queenslander and,

712
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,059
you know, generally shorten words.

713
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:57,860
And so I wasn't understood literally,

714
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,760
just linguistically, people didn't understand what I was saying.

715
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,860
In Asia or in?

716
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,760
In Asia, yeah, probably in Melbourne and Sydney too.

717
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,960
But yeah, look, I mean,

718
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,559
so I was fortunate at a young age to be very clear

719
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,260
in how you communicate, to say what you mean,

720
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,159
to always stop and pause and think about who you're talking to,

721
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,059
to not talk in implied language.

722
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:27,460
I often find that people,

723
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,360
they don't intentionally do that.

724
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,360
They start talking as if they know what you're talking about.

725
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,260
And that's, again, one of the great things about our organisation.

726
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,360
Our team aren't afraid to sort of,

727
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,860
you know, politely sort of stop that person or interrupt and just say,

728
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,559
look, I actually don't understand what you're talking about.

729
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,360
But yeah, communication,

730
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,460
certainly in the business that we're in is everything.

731
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,559
Because we are communicating ideas,

732
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,559
we're communicating direction,

733
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,460
we're communicating recommendations.

734
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,760
And, you know, a lot of the time we're influencing, right?

735
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,960
We're influencing outcomes because, you know, we're advisors.

736
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,659
So, you know, you're paid to provide advice.

737
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:13,360
And so whether it's written or whether it's, you know,

738
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,659
oral, it is absolutely paramount.

739
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:21,760
So, and I believe that it's like training.

740
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,360
And I say to the guys in our business,

741
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,360
see every opportunity, whether it's an internal team meeting,

742
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:31,559
as an opportunity to practise how you communicate,

743
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,260
because it is something that you get better at doing.

744
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,260
And I look at athletes, for example, that play,

745
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,260
and then they, like yourself, they go into media.

746
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,360
But if they look back to their playing days and, you know,

747
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,659
some probably can't string a couple of words together.

748
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,659
And then you see them in media and they're like some of the most articulate,

749
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,860
you know, you love listening to them talk.

750
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,559
And that's just practise, right?

751
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:57,360
And so, yeah, I think communication is everything.

752
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,559
How important has collaboration been for you as well, Nathan?

753
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,360
Yeah, look, it's massive, right?

754
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:12,260
And it's not easy because, you know,

755
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,659
I believe in chemistry between people.

756
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:19,460
And you can't, you know, some people you just gravitate to.

757
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,960
They're probably your best friends.

758
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,659
And then there's people that you may never gravitate to,

759
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:27,260
but you have to do business with or, you know,

760
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,460
you may be in a community with them.

761
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,559
And so, you know, I often reflect on how I feel in those situations

762
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,659
when I'm collaborating with people that I don't necessarily gel with.

763
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:46,659
Because the value of collaborating versus not is, it's immense.

764
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:49,960
I mean, it's the difference between success and failure,

765
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,159
or not even success and failure,

766
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,559
whether something can be an opportunity or not an opportunity.

767
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:04,960
And so, you know, the way I guess my style is to be transparent,

768
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,260
to, you know, to openly share not just the positives of a situation,

769
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:18,760
but also the challenges, to build rapport and trust and to go forward.

770
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,260
But, I mean, you know, as I said, communication is everything.

771
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,760
But, you know, you can't achieve outcomes if you can't collaborate.

772
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,860
Otherwise, you know, maybe you're a surgeon

773
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,360
and you operate or something like that on your own.

774
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,559
But in terms of what I do, it's a vital part of everything.

775
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,559
And I love what you just said then because collaboration is easy for us,

776
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,659
as you said, with the natural group that are your people

777
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:44,360
and you love being around and you find that synergy.

778
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,659
But you're right, isn't it?

779
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:49,159
If the ones that we don't naturally gel with, that's hard.

780
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,260
I find that really hard because you're grinding the gears.

781
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,260
But, you know, the worst part of me is, you know,

782
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,059
I don't want to have anything to do with that person

783
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:00,559
because in reality, it's a pretty narrow life you live, isn't it?

784
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,159
If you can't find a way, you know.

785
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:03,960
Darce, you're right.

786
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,960
And, you know, as I get older, I struggle with it even more

787
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,460
because of the energy that it takes to put into those relationships.

788
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,960
And from experience, you know, how challenging that can be.

789
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,860
But again, you come back to it's just essential.

790
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,960
You can kind of just get old and just, you know, close your mind too,

791
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,159
which is completely fine too.

792
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:33,159
I don't have an issue with that where you just say,

793
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:35,260
I just want to hang around my people.

794
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,460
I get that.

795
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,159
But at the same time, you know, I just remember as a young person

796
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,860
because I used to push so hard and want things so bad

797
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,659
that I would force relationships.

798
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:51,360
And I remember some of my early bosses in Asia,

799
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,059
one in particular who was a Singapore lady,

800
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,860
who we just butt heads.

801
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,260
Like, you know, I was this young upstart.

802
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,360
She was this proud, older, you know, Singaporean lady.

803
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,260
And we really did not like each other, but yet she was my boss.

804
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:13,059
But fast forward towards the end of that professional relationship

805
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:17,360
and even, you know, after we sort of finished working together,

806
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,159
we became really close.

807
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,760
And what I learned is that you can't,

808
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,260
just because they may not be one of your people,

809
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,960
you can't be quick.

810
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Quick to form views because often, you know,

811
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,960
there's a lot to people and you've got to have patience.

812
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,760
And so you've got to give the benefit of the doubt.

813
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,559
And it's bloody hard to do, particularly when you're in a rush.

814
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,559
So, yeah, look, it's not easy.

815
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,760
And to this day, like one of the things I hate more than anything

816
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,659
is going to conferences and people go,

817
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:50,360
but Nathan, you know, you get on with everyone,

818
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,159
you know, you're so talkative and you can talk about anything, whatever.

819
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:59,159
But I like fear, you know, those sort of environments.

820
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,760
That's funny, trying to do some research for our chat today.

821
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,159
And you're not an easy man to research, by the way.

822
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,159
But I was looking at your LinkedIn and there's so many,

823
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,159
every time it wasn't about you beating your chest about you,

824
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,659
it was about congratulating someone else.

825
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:16,659
It's just a, hey, well done, great work.

826
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:18,659
I looked as though a lot of those projects,

827
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:20,659
maybe some of them I'm sure you were behind,

828
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:23,960
but others it looked like maybe even some rivals that you were, you know,

829
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,960
congratulating and that's unique, you know, is that just you being you?

830
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Yeah, look, I mean, I just love seeing people do well.

831
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,960
I just genuinely do.

832
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
You know, my industry is small.

833
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,960
I think every industry is probably small when you get to,

834
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,960
you know, our age and our level.

835
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,960
And, you know, we're all part of the same community.

836
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,960
And so, you know, from my perspective,

837
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
you just, you do,

838
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
you do just want to see people do well.

839
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
That's the bottom line.

840
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
I mean, look, you know, we've all got people I'm sure.

841
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,960
If we're being honest, we don't want them to see do well.

842
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,960
But, you know, again, I go back to that relationship I had with the boss.

843
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,960
You know, time in my view just sort of heals everything.

844
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,960
And I guess I'm at an age now where, you know,

845
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,960
I just generally want to see people do well.

846
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,960
And I think because it's just good for society.

847
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
And, yeah, it's just positive.

848
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
It's generally a healthier way to live, isn't it,

849
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
when we get it right most of the time.

850
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

851
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Oh, mate, look, there's a handful.

852
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,960
You know, I often don't talk about it very much,

853
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
but I'd certainly probably start with my father.

854
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,960
He chairs my organisation.

855
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,960
His influence on my life has been profound.

856
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
And, you know, time's been a challenging relationship.

857
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Not bad at all, but, you know, I guess young bull, old bull type thing.

858
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,960
But his influence on my life has been profound.

859
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,960
And I'm only just realising that at my age now.

860
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
And it's interesting.

861
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,960
We got a really special time together in Italy recently and, you know,

862
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,960
just got to reflect on a few things in life.

863
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,960
Not deep because he's not a deep guy.

864
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,960
But, you know, it's just I'm so blessed

865
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
to have someone like that.

866
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
To have someone like him in my life.

867
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,960
So I'd start with him.

868
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,960
You know, some of my early bosses who clearly recognised talent in me

869
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,960
that I didn't see because I didn't certainly see it for about two decades

870
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,960
that gave me the opportunities and, you know, instilled in me things

871
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,960
like thinking strategically, communicating,

872
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,960
all those things that we've really touched on on this call.

873
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
And then also, you know,

874
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
my former business partner who founded Emerge Capital.

875
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,960
If it wasn't for him, I literally wouldn't be here today.

876
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,960
As I shared with you offline, he deconstructed me from an institutional

877
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,960
and corporate person.

878
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,960
And, you know, I thank him every day to myself.

879
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,960
Probably not enough to him in terms of giving me the opportunity.

880
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,960
And then I just think lastly, Das, is just, you know, your friends.

881
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,960
You know, again, as you get to our stage in life,

882
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,960
you really do value, you spoke about Leon and your relationship with him.

883
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:37,960
I just feel blessed to have great friends that make your life just so much better.

884
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,960
And then lastly, mate, is, you know, I just can't thank my wife

885
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,960
and my son enough because they are, they're everything, right?

886
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
They are.

887
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,960
They literally are the good times and the tough times.

888
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,960
And my wife's just, you know, she's a superhero.

889
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:05,960
And I don't know anyone that should have to put up with me because I'm so intense.

890
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
But she's a very special person, mate.

891
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
So, yeah, there's a few.

892
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
And I'm sure everyone would have similar stories.

893
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
Well, beautifully said, Nathan.

894
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,960
It's something I do love asking because, you know, I know I'm sure your dad

895
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
and your family.

896
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,960
And your family and your mates will love hearing that because we don't often

897
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
take the time to do that, do we?

898
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
And I know I don't.

899
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,960
You know, I was going for a walk the other day and Bec asked me the same question.

900
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
He said, you're good at asking everyone else.

901
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,960
Over to you.

902
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,960
And it is, it puts you back in your reflective moment, doesn't it?

903
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
So great people in your life.

904
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
It's nice to take that time.

905
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,960
You do business around the world in a unique space to work through Asia and Europe

906
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,960
and the Middle East and incredible success across Australia.

907
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,960
We love collaboration in the elite world.

908
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
We find it's a bit of a superpower.

909
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,960
Has there been someone you thought of I could collaborate with on any part

910
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,960
of your life that would jump out, a name that springs to mind?

911
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
From all of those experiences?

912
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,960
From anything that appeals to you.

913
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,960
It's a diverse life you've lived.

914
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,960
Has there been a person you thought that's the person I'd love to spend some time

915
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,960
and collaborate with on any of your passions?

916
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Oh, Darce, I'm going to have to take a rain check on it because, you know,

917
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,960
when you just said all of that, I just had this vision of my life literally

918
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,960
run through me.

919
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,960
And when you're going through all those markets that I've worked in,

920
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,960
I mean, I've just met some profound people, like truly profound.

921
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,960
And when I was young in particular and I was put in these positions that I really,

922
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,960
you know, people shouldn't have entrusted me because I was just so young,

923
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
but it gave me the opportunity to meet.

924
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,960
You know, I'd read an article the other day about how Thaksin Shinawatra

925
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,960
has just moved back to Thailand after being in exile for 10 years.

926
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
I remember a dinner I had with her.

927
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,960
I don't know, probably 10 years ago when I was at Emerge Capital,

928
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,960
and I'd lived in Thailand, right?

929
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,960
And, you know, people get up in the cinemas, like before they start,

930
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,960
and they pay homage to the king and even to the leader.

931
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,960
And here I am sitting at dinner with Thaksin Shinawatra.

932
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
It was profound.

933
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,960
I mean, not that there was collaboration in that sort of dinner,

934
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,960
but I just come back to, you know, those opportunities and people

935
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,960
that I've met and have collaborated in.

936
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,960
There's so much we haven't touched on,

937
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,960
but some of the things that I did in China with some of the Chinese,

938
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,960
you know, I was there when they opened up.

939
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,960
They were admitted into the World Trade Organisation,

940
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,960
and, you know, I was working with Walmart, rapidly opening stores

941
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,960
because Walmart's the largest retailer in the world.

942
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,960
And, you know, just that collaboration with them, you know,

943
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
the Walton family flying in.

944
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,960
To China on their jets along with others, you know.

945
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,960
So, mate, so much.

946
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah, I'll just stop there because I'll just ramble.

947
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,960
Well, there's a three-part series in this, Nathan.

948
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
I loved it.

949
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,960
You just mentioned the Walton family and doing business in China.

950
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,960
We didn't even touch on India, so we might have to do a round two

951
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
at some stage.

952
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,960
It took a bit of work to get you to the table the first time round,

953
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,960
but we are really grateful to be able to collaborate with you

954
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
in the elitist space.

955
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,960
And you're a great champion for us and telling that story

956
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,960
as you did so beautifully today.

957
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,960
And I love, yeah, you spoke about people giving you an opportunity

958
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,960
when you were young when you probably didn't feel like looking back.

959
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
You had earned it.

960
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,960
But I love that you're passing that on to people the same way.

961
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,960
And a fascinating story.

962
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
Really appreciate you spending the time, Nathan, today.

963
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
There's been a lot of wisdom in it.

964
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
Thanks a lot.

965
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Thanks very much, Darcy.

966
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,960
As I said at the beginning, I appreciate the opportunity,

967
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,960
particularly to Matt and Stacey who run my groups.

968
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
I mean, I'm sure if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here.

969
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be in this position today with you.

970
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
So thank you.

971
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,960
