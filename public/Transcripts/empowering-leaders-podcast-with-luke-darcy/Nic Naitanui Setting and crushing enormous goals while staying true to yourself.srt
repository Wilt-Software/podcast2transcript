1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
I think that's been a good part, too, because sometimes, as you know, in this world, in

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,699
this game, your ego can get struck a lot of the time, and you can think you're bigger

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,939
than what you are, and it's always good to have those people sort of pull you back down

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,300
to your place and realize that you're just a person out there entertaining, and sometimes

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,359
you do it well, sometimes you do it not so well.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,660
Nick Natanui is this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,879
Nick is an absolute champion on and off the field, really inspired by the story he shares

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,240
of his mother looking after Nick and his twin brother in an immigration detention center

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,140
as a single mum following the tragic death of his father, how the Buller 3G spirit of

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,140
community and family shapes his outlook on life, and really all of the decisions that

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,560
he makes.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,719
He shares the dream that he, Michael Sonny Walters, and Chris Yarrant all had as kids

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,299
growing up.

14
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,240
In the same street in Perth of using AFL football to become the first members of their family

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,200
to buy a home, and wanting that for their mums more than any other goal in life.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,159
It's a brilliant story.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,140
Nick Natanui is an absolute champion on and off the field, and we are really privileged

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,599
to have Nick in Alita Connect.

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,579
He and Nick talk about how the diversity of his group, media producers, property experts,

20
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,859
social venture entrepreneurs, have all helped him in his life post-professional sport.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,379
Book a discovery call.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,280
We'd love you to join Alita.

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,700
Alita Connect, head to alitacollective.com.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Big thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,359
Alita athletes like Nick Natanui absolutely understand the value of getting a good night's

26
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,540
sleep.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,040
We spend a third of our life in bed, so having a look at a Temper mattress is something you

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,760
should check out today.

29
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,689
Nick Natanui's legacy as an Australian rules footballer is as significant as anyone in

30
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,250
the modern era.

31
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,510
The overall number two draft pick in 2008 of Fijian heritage went on to be a three-time

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,489
All-Australian, a two-time West Coast Eagle.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,530
He was best and fairest and played with athleticism and power the likes of which the game hadn't

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,209
seen before.

35
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:07,290
A genuine cult hero who from his very first game became one of the most recognised high

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,810
profile and loved sports stars in Australia.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,949
Nick, great to see you.

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,409
Congratulations on an amazing career.

39
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:13,150
Thanks, Stas.

40
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:13,650
Thanks for having me.

41
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,189
I love the intro.

42
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,550
I'll have to cut that out and put it at home, I reckon.

43
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,330
Well, mate, it's all true and it's such a great story.

44
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,370
It's one of the most enjoyable ones to tell from an AFL point of view.

45
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,969
Can I go back?

46
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,969
Mum and Dad were born.

47
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,710
You were born in a small village near Suva in Fiji.

48
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,330
Your parents emigrated to Australia and I understand you tragically lost your dad to

49
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,750
cancer, leaving your mum with you and your twin brother.

50
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,650
You're just one years of age at the time.

51
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,449
Can you describe how hard that must have been for your mum?

52
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:42,930
Yeah, tough transition.

53
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,030
I think as a child, you don't know any different and that's probably a credit to mum for making

54
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,810
it so seamless and you just think it's normal, your day-to-day stuff.

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,610
You don't think of what's actually happened or what's sort of transpired in the months

56
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:55,810
or years.

57
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,469
Yeah, it was tough.

58
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,969
I guess being in Australia at that young age, mum wasn't an Australian citizen.

59
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,389
She was still applying for a permanent residency, which I found out later on in life.

60
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,270
Having no Australian citizenship and my old man passing away meant we had to spend time

61
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,250
in a detention centre.

62
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,030
We spent a good part of a year and I'd love to tell you I remember it, I don't, because

63
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,370
I was only a toddler in there.

64
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:31,050
I was a kid in Sydney and yeah, just through the, I guess the grace of people out there

65
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,849
in the community who reached out and had a home in New South Wales looking after us and

66
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,830
helping us go through the sort of government and legal system and putting us up in their

67
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,770
house for a long time, we're able to be out in the community and I always look back at

68
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,349
those days and go, it must have been real tough for mum, but to get to where I am now,

69
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,370
it's been a long, long journey.

70
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:54,930
Yeah.

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,150
Yeah.

72
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,490
And Nick?

73
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,689
I understand it was a family in New South Wales that really supported your mum and the

74
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,169
family, as you said.

75
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:04,110
So a year in detention centre for your mum, coming to Australia to forge a better life

76
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,189
for you and your twin brother.

77
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:05,569
Yeah.

78
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:10,250
And then, as you said, the generosity of a family to really make life in Australia possible.

79
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,610
You must be grateful for that.

80
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,129
I am.

81
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,770
And it's something that I'm very passionate about away from football.

82
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,250
A lot of the immigration stuff and new migrants and I guess knowing how hard it is and how

83
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,970
hard it was for mum.

84
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,329
I always think back to not only was she trying to find a way for us to have a better life

85
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:25,810
in Australia.

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,829
But, you know, she's also grieving at the same time.

87
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,649
So to be able to do that with, you know, I've got two under two at the moment, not quite

88
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,670
twins, but to do it with twin boys who are running a mark would have been really hard.

89
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,470
But like you said, the generosity, I've always been a big one on giving back to those that

90
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,410
need it more.

91
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,569
Not those that need it, but those that need it more.

92
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,509
And yeah, that's always been mum's sort of mantra.

93
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,189
And I think, yeah, that's because it's come from those who did it to us when we were such

94
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:50,670
little kids.

95
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,930
Your mum, I believe, is she returned back to Fiji in later life?

96
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,149
Yeah.

97
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,689
Was that tour always back to her?

98
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,750
Her home and upbringing?

99
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:57,389
It does.

100
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:57,709
Yeah.

101
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,410
My sister had some kids, so she wanted to be around her grandchildren.

102
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,310
And yeah, I guess mum, you know, always had a connection with home.

103
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,449
We'd try to go back to Fiji whenever we could, back to the village lifestyle.

104
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,329
And, you know, I've got 300 odd family members in this one village.

105
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,769
So when they say it takes a village to raise a child, it actually does.

106
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,850
Because I find how tough it is over here when you're looking for a babysitter.

107
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,490
Over there, it's just, you know, drop them off at a house here, go there.

108
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,970
And mum always wanted to go back.

109
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,370
But, you know, she wanted to make sure that, you know, her boys were settled here in Australia

110
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,350
and had a good job.

111
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,689
So, yeah, I was about 24, I reckon, when mum moved back to Fiji.

112
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,389
And, you know, obviously in the AFL system for a number of years, mum thought, you know,

113
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,709
he's okay, he's set to go.

114
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,170
My brother finishes his plumbing apprenticeship and, you know, had a good job.

115
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,750
So she was back to the islands.

116
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,850
But, yeah, that was always on the cards for her.

117
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,170
And I'm glad she got to do it before, you know, before she passed in 2015.

118
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,290
You can't believe the commitment, can you?

119
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,410
Yeah.

120
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,470
Yeah.

121
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,490
Yeah.

122
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:53,509
Yeah.

123
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:53,569
Yeah.

124
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:53,589
Yeah.

125
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:53,610
Yeah.

126
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:53,670
Yeah.

127
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,689
Yeah.

128
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,189
Two boys are settled and then feel comfortable to go back home.

129
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,449
You eventually settle in Bushby Street, Midlands, which has become, Midvale, sorry, about 30

130
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,689
minutes out of the CBD of Perth, if I'm correct.

131
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:07,550
And it's become famous in the AFL world.

132
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,649
Can you share us about the unique neighbourhood that you eventually settled in?

133
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:10,990
Yeah.

134
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,029
People ask me about Midland and I try to explain Midvale, Midlands, the same suburb to people

135
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,370
in their respective states.

136
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,209
I think in Victoria, you'd say, oh, Frankston back in the day is Midland.

137
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,589
No disrespect to Frankston.

138
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,449
No disrespect to Frankston or Sunshine, those type of areas.

139
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,170
In Adelaide, it's probably the Elizabeths, those type of places.

140
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,189
Working class.

141
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,810
Working class, rough, solidly earth people, but yeah, very rough.

142
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,069
There's a lot of, you know, a lot of problems and issues in those places, but you also get

143
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,050
a lot of genuine, you know, raw reality of the way life is and the way, you know, but

144
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,769
for us, like I said, we had a pretty rough time and, you know, mum was always grateful

145
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:46,670
just to be in Australia.

146
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,470
So that stuff wasn't hard.

147
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,670
Like, you know, like growing up in a village with no hot water and, you know, and all this

148
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,149
sort of stuff.

149
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,610
And no TVs and no electricity.

150
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,670
It's, um, but anything was a luxury.

151
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,209
So I didn't, we didn't care, but it was tough.

152
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,790
We had a lot of people struggling around us, which I think was the biggest thing.

153
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,810
I think if we were in a better suburb, it would have, you know, sort of exacerbated

154
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,149
how poor, how broke we actually were.

155
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,910
But to have everyone struggling around you just made it feel normal and then made you

156
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,910
feel comfortable day to day.

157
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,449
And then you have this incredible stroke of genius from an AFL point of view where Michael

158
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,649
Walters, who's become a legend of the Fremantle Dockers and played 234 games.

159
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:22,769
Yeah.

160
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,129
Chris Yarram.

161
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,930
Chris Yarram was a number six overall pick and Nick Natanui in the same street to go

162
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,029
on and combine, be close to 600 AFL games.

163
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,290
It's, it's a lightning strike, isn't it?

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,550
Of growing up really.

165
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:34,870
Yeah.

166
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,329
It's like someone planted us there and it was there for a reason.

167
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,509
I always pinched myself because I don't think as well, if I didn't live next to those guys,

168
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:42,610
I'd be playing AFL football.

169
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,649
So, and it wasn't just living on the same street.

170
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:45,990
We actually all live next door to each other.

171
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,730
So yeah, I'm a bad advocate for Auskick football because we always skip training as kids to

172
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,649
play footy at home.

173
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:56,269
We used to use our rubbish bins, the green and yellow bin as our goals and shut the street

174
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:56,430
down.

175
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,310
My neighbors used to hate us, but it's funny when you go back, some of those oldies still

176
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,149
live there and they, they're the first ones to say, yeah, I loved it when these kids played

177
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,509
on the street, they claim and embrace us.

178
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,509
So they, they loved it.

179
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,370
But I remember they used to hate us and I don't blame them, but yeah, we used to, we

180
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,170
used to train and you know, it's funny.

181
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,670
There's always one guy that gets missed out.

182
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,490
The guy at the house behind us on the next street, but their back fence was on the back

183
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,269
of Chris Yarram's one was, was Jeff Garlett.

184
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,490
So, um, so we had a pretty talented little.

185
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,269
Little team, little street team.

186
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:30,290
And, um, yeah, as we sort of, uh, got talked into by a local coach to come down and, um,

187
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,690
you know, his wife worked at our primary school and said, come to this local footy club, Midvale

188
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,090
and, you know, learn how to get a bit of structure in your life.

189
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,990
But, oh, I'm so grateful that they came along because they taught us a bit about planning,

190
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,269
not just about football, but you know, how to budget that.

191
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,669
They brought my family in who, you know, we sort of kept to ourselves and little pockets

192
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,990
and taught us, you know, the Aussie way of life.

193
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,970
Um, and you know, what a barbecue was.

194
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:52,629
I didn't know what bangers were.

195
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,049
It was a mash, all this sort of stuff was.

196
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,330
And, but yeah, having those two boys next to me, um, probably, you know, reflects a

197
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,909
little bit on the way I played my football as well.

198
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,929
Your athletic ability could have taken you anywhere, probably to basketball or, you know,

199
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,169
with the Fijian history and rugby would have made sense, but you had these brilliant indigenous

200
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:13,470
Australians who, as you said, they played the game with a gift that you couldn't believe.

201
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,710
And you probably, uh, you know, a 200 centimeter version of that was probably how it played

202
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:17,909
out.

203
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:18,610
Is that how you feel?

204
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,110
Yeah, I think so.

205
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,330
Yeah.

206
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,490
I used to come up with a lot of flack over the years around not playing like a big man.

207
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,409
Like I could tap the ball and stuff, but you know, your rucks around taking marks around

208
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,710
the ground and doing those sort of things.

209
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,649
But I learned off those guys who are, you know, they're the zippiest small fours.

210
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,649
They're the civil realities of the, of the AFL.

211
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,470
And they were just so skillful and talented.

212
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,549
They had a ball on the string.

213
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,190
Like they made it look so seamless.

214
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:41,129
And, you know, you see guys, you know, of indigenous background who do the same thing

215
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,250
and they've been doing it for years.

216
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,809
So I picked up, that was my introduction to football.

217
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,570
I didn't have the structure and bouncing and the technique, um, down pat.

218
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,570
It was just go and have a bit of flair.

219
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,470
And, you know, we never had such.

220
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,649
Shots from 10 meters in front.

221
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,509
We used to try and dribble it from the boundary and things.

222
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,269
So sometimes, yeah, I used to get frustrated because I'm like, this is my version of footy.

223
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,769
It was never the, um, you know, the basic fundamentals.

224
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,850
It was always the Larry stuff, but it wasn't showing off.

225
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,750
It was just the way we learned to play.

226
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,470
And yeah, I'm, I'm so grateful for it because otherwise I think I would have been two, three

227
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,509
years into the game and I wouldn't have made it as far.

228
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,870
I think some of the highlights that I've been able to produce.

229
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,409
Yeah.

230
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,370
Sonny and Chris are probably the reason why.

231
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,129
And thank God no one got hold of you and bored you out of, uh,

232
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:22,470
existence.

233
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,929
Which probably would have happened.

234
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,429
You would have been overcoached and someone would have no Nick, you got to go and play

235
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:27,889
this way.

236
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,669
And you brought something to the game that makes us smile, uh, that no one else could

237
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,210
do before.

238
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,889
And, and, and when you were doing that at your best, you were unstoppable and we loved

239
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,289
every bit of watching it from, from afar.

240
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,809
The thing I've always, your athletic achievements are next level, Nick, but anytime I've ever

241
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,789
seen you or been lucky enough to be in your company, it just feels like you bring this

242
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:49,269
great energy and this happy, uh, vibe.

243
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,830
What do you think has been the key to being happy and successful?

244
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,330
Oh, I think it's just the Fijian way of life.

245
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,929
Like everyone's just the, the bullet smile is just like happy.

246
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,509
Like, I don't know.

247
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:58,669
It's funny living.

248
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,250
I always have to like base my life in Australia to my back, my life.

249
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,750
When I go home to the village where no one, I think the humility that you have back there

250
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,769
is a, is a big part of it.

251
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:08,309
No one cares.

252
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,250
There's no status.

253
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,129
There's no hierarchy.

254
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,370
You know, I go home back to my village and they'll chuck a mop or a broom and say, Hey

255
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,250
mate, like get to work.

256
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,250
Like, I don't care if you earn and, you know, a couple hundred grand or you're on TV on

257
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,389
the weekend, you come and you do, you come and chop some of the stuff in the, in the,

258
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,269
in the gardens and that.

259
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,149
So I think it's that sort of thing.

260
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,190
And everyone's so welcoming back home.

261
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,710
It's, it's, and I could go back to the start coming to Australia.

262
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:33,450
I'm just grateful to be over here and to be able to do what I've done.

263
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:38,149
So people reflect on my career sometimes and talk about the injuries and, you know, disappointments

264
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,210
in, you know, footy and things I missed out on.

265
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,769
But I always think of the things I got to do and some of the people I got to reach and

266
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,590
influence as well.

267
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,269
And I see that as just as, just as powerful, but I don't know.

268
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,970
Sometimes you can get caught up being so stressed playing this game because it is a big business,

269
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,470
but.

270
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,649
I love going out to, like, I just got back from a remote community, um, you know, a couple

271
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,070
of hours east of Broome and just seeing some of those indigenous kids in the bush who don't

272
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,789
have footy boots or just play footy for the love and passion of it.

273
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,289
I always thought that's what footy was about.

274
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:11,730
So yes, there's nice playing in front of 80, 90,000, but seeing the sort of grassroot,

275
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,289
like core essence of footy has always given me a drive and happiness.

276
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:18,909
So I always think back to that and that makes me the happiest person on earth.

277
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:21,110
I love your perspective, Nick.

278
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:21,909
And you're, you know,

279
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,990
a beautiful twin brother who's a plumber and I've heard you say it before, he's cleaning

280
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,049
toilets and I'm kicking footies for a living, getting paid really well.

281
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,529
And so sometimes we don't always have that perspective, but as you say, when you put

282
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,909
in the content, your worst day of a knee injury, isn't that bad when you think about it, is

283
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:37,029
it?

284
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,730
No, no.

285
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,090
And like I said, my twin brother was the first to say it all the time.

286
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,269
Like he was up at 4am, you know, elbow deep in someone's toilet, cleaning it out.

287
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,149
And you know, every time I'd whinge about, you know, I'd, I'd complain and I'm not gonna

288
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:48,409
lie to you.

289
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,509
I'd complain about someone coming up and bothering me for a photo sometimes, or,

290
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:51,889
you know, I'd complain about someone coming up and bothering me for a photo sometimes, or,

291
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,649
you know, we've got a session and then we've got to go and sit in a meeting for two or

292
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,429
three hours or something.

293
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,149
And he'd just laugh because he'd be like, mate, you don't know what the real world's

294
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:00,389
like.

295
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,129
And he laughs now that I'm finished, you know, that I'm, I'm out in the real world and I

296
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,009
see how hard it is.

297
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,250
You're not getting paid half as much as what you are as a footballer.

298
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,149
And, you know, you're required to work at least nine to five.

299
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,470
And, um, but no, I think that perspective and, you know, has, has kept me grounded and

300
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,389
having people at home that, you know, my football's not, my family's not a traditional football

301
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:19,730
family.

302
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,129
So we don't talk footy at home.

303
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:21,870
It's, you know, it's normal.

304
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,649
It's not normally rugby or something different.

305
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,509
So that was, I think, a blessing in itself as well.

306
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,490
And my brother, you know, he was, he still is an Adelaide Crow supporter.

307
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,129
He grew up loving Brett Burton.

308
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,330
He just loved the Birdman.

309
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,250
So his dream was to always see someone take a hang like he did on my shoulders.

310
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,009
And yeah, he never went for West Coast.

311
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,289
He supported me, but he didn't go for us.

312
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,730
And, um, yeah.

313
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,110
And all my mates, like we've got a range.

314
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,570
I don't expect people just to be mates to me because they're, you know, an Eagle supporter.

315
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,429
My best mates are, you know, Frio supporters or, you know, Bombers, whatever it is.

316
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,610
And I think that's been a good part too, because sometimes, as you know, in this world,

317
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,230
in this game, your ego can get struck, um, you know, a lot of the time and you can think

318
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,409
you're bigger than what you are.

319
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,269
And it's always good to have those people sort of pull you back, back down to your place

320
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,169
and realize that, you know, you're just a person out there entertaining and sometimes

321
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,269
you do it well, sometimes you do it not so well.

322
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:14,370
There's a beautiful humility to all of that.

323
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,330
And, you know, you, people wouldn't understand from almost the first or second game you play,

324
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,370
there was this intensity of fascination.

325
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,370
With you and WA being a footy mad town and the amount of attention and scrutiny that

326
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,009
came your way, you got to hand over the jumper to a young man called Harley Reid, number

327
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:36,350
one draft pick, who's probably captivated WA in the same way you did all those years

328
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,669
ago.

329
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,289
What, what advice would you give him?

330
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,090
Yeah, I catch up with Harley every, every sort of fortnight at the club.

331
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,169
Uh, and I speak to him.

332
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,190
I took him down to the beach for a coffee actually the other week to just talk about

333
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,929
the highs and lows of footy.

334
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:51,409
I was lucky enough that I caught up with Juddy when I was 17, 18 years old.

335
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:55,929
And he spoke a bit about the roller coaster and, and WA, you know, him and him and Cuzz,

336
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,230
who were the nine before me sort of, you know, we're in that same sort of spotlight and,

337
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,929
um, spoke about, you know, when you're up and you, you know, you're riding these highs,

338
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,669
you'll, and then you go down and you're losing and, or, you know, the articles are bad about

339
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,490
you, um, you can really affect yourself mentally.

340
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,629
So, um, he always talked about the roller coaster and I've always spoken to other guys

341
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,710
about it, but Harley in particular, you know, I was in the paper every second day in WA.

342
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,049
Harley's in the paper every day, like the back page every single day.

343
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:21,429
Yeah.

344
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:27,110
And it's become, uh, an obsession and cra- and a craze, which he's pretty level-headed.

345
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,350
He's a good kid and he understands sort of how it works, but I always just go in and

346
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,210
check in on him, but make sure that he understands how, you know, the footy media work and especially

347
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,669
in a fishbowl town like WA, uh, where there's only two teams and you know, all the other

348
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:43,669
sports are sort of dampened, um, so AFL takes priority.

349
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,669
Yeah.

350
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:47,669
It must be hard for a kid because when you're 18, 19, all you want to do is play footy,

351
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,049
hang out with your mates and all of a sudden this pressure's thrusted upon you.

352
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,049
Yeah.

353
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,149
So I feel for him, but I'm also happy because it means that I'm not on there, so I, um,

354
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,549
but he, he, he'll handle it really well.

355
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:01,649
He's, he's mature beyond his years, so no, I think he'll be, he's perfectly suited for

356
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,649
it.

357
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,169
Chris Judd said something that always resonated with me that he, you know, and I won't quite

358
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:10,870
get it right, but he said, why would I give away my sense of wellbeing by reading an article,

359
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
good or bad?

360
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,330
He said, the good sometimes is just as you read this stuff about you being superhuman

361
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,730
and then, and when you have a bad game, you read about yourself in a way.

362
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,669
So you know, he just ignored that.

363
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:24,429
You go, you're the trusted people in your world, your coaches and the handful of people,

364
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,889
but try and leave that outside, outside noise out of your life.

365
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,850
Is that, sounds harder to do than perhaps it is?

366
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,850
No, it's big.

367
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,409
And I feel bad sometimes saying it cause I, you know, I, I've always worked with closely

368
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,169
with people like channel seven and things like that, but I never watched the news.

369
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,169
I don't read the paper.

370
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,470
Like it's just, and not because I hate it or don't agree with it.

371
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,509
Like you said, it just, it's good for your mental health, especially when you're in it

372
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,509
in the spotlight.

373
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:50,470
A lot of the time, if you keep up to, you know, the date with what people are writing about,

374
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,629
saying about you every single day, you can really, you know, lose your way.

375
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,110
And I'm guessing someone that's in Hollywood or something like that, they're not reading

376
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,529
the tabloid media or watching the news or things like that, because if they did that,

377
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,210
um, either be full of themselves or they'd be really depressed.

378
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,470
So Jody's probably the man to, to thank for that.

379
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,630
He will never take credit for it, or maybe it will now, but, um, nah, he was pretty good.

380
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,069
And, and I've spent a lot of time with Kazi as well, um, you know, over his sort of roller

381
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,470
coaster of the journey, post football as well, and, and learn the right and the wrong things.

382
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,470
And we happily speak about it.

383
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,609
The right and wrong things to do, uh, especially in our town, how much bigger it is if you

384
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,970
do those things.

385
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,490
So that's, I've been lucky to have those guys, um, from the young age teach me and navigate

386
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,150
through, you know, the world of footy.

387
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,349
Your twin brother's right.

388
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:39,230
He said you're in the real world now, post the AFL and, and life changes, uh, immediately.

389
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,710
I know you've got a range of different interests, uh, a non-alcoholic seltzer called Alter is,

390
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,230
uh, is getting great traction around Australia.

391
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,970
Tell us about what you're up to post footy.

392
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,970
Yeah.

393
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,130
So, um, I've got a friend, uh, former teammate of mine that played at Brisbane as well as

394
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,009
involved and, and his mate Darcy, um, he's sort of the brains behind it.

395
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,210
Um, he's, uh, worked for a big company and, and understand the sort of beverage game.

396
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,210
I, I don't know.

397
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,210
I was reluctant at the start.

398
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,309
I know a lot of football is getting the fashion or drinks or beers or things like that, or,

399
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:12,089
and, um, don't really work well, but once I got into it, I started really looking, um,

400
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,970
into the nuts and bolts of it and understanding it.

401
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,470
And yeah, we're doing a healthy sort of seltzer and having all natural ingredients is, you

402
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,470
know, a big thing.

403
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,470
Um, the zero sugar and low calories is sort of the in thing at the moment.

404
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,130
Um, you know, everyone went through the kombucha phase and drinking that and, you know, we

405
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,589
thought, how can we replicate that and do it in a, a sparkling version that actually

406
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:31,829
tastes, you know, not like a health drink.

407
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,349
And I think we've nailed it.

408
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,430
Um, yeah, we've teamed up, you know, with some of your mates and, you know, the shiny

409
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,789
venues car with pubs and, you know, all the groceries and that are getting on board and

410
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:40,789
convenient.

411
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,710
So it's, uh, it's been, it's been a good challenge.

412
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,470
It's been a, a real, uh, learning curve because, um, like I said to you earlier, you don't

413
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,470
get handed anything.

414
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,470
Um.

415
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,849
You know, you played so many games of footy or did what you did.

416
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,430
They still make you earn it.

417
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,690
They might look after you a little bit, but, um, that's been the best thing I've been looking

418
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,009
for a challenge since finishing.

419
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,710
And this is that, you know, that little drive and challenge and sort of a test for me that,

420
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,849
that, um, that keeps me, keeps me going and keeps me sane.

421
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,890
And you're starting to use your brain in a different way to grow a dream, a really competitive

422
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,890
market.

423
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,890
As you said, Nicknado is going to open the door a few times, but your product's got to

424
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,890
be good.

425
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,710
And then your business model's got to be good.

426
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,410
And so you're finding that that's something you're enjoying, trying to pull those pieces

427
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,470
of the jigsaw together.

428
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,470
Yeah, for sure.

429
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,470
And, and I look at it, you're competing with, you can compete with the smaller brands, but,

430
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,970
um, I don't know, being footballers, you want to compete with the best.

431
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,029
So I look at Coke, I look at Pepsi, I look at, um, Red Bull V all of those and I think,

432
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:34,829
you know, how can we, you know, we don't have to do the same numbers as them, but let's

433
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:39,549
try and see their formula and what they do and try and, um, you know, get close to them.

434
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,230
So, uh, we'll see where it takes us.

435
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,390
I'd love to look back in, jump back on a podcast with you in a couple of years time and see

436
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,390
it doing well.

437
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,470
But, um, nah, I'll give it every, every shot I have.

438
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,470
And the fact you've got.

439
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,470
The, the supply chain.

440
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,170
I love, you know, where you've got to already and, uh, having tasted it, it, it is a great

441
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,170
product.

442
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,549
And, and I think that's where the market for the next generation don't drink like our generation

443
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:59,549
drank.

444
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,369
And so it feels like you guys have got a plan that makes sense.

445
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,569
We've been really privileged, Nick, to cross over with you in something we're really passionate

446
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:09,509
about, uh, a thing called Alita and Alita Connect, where we bring together people from

447
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,190
diverse backgrounds and different thinking in groups of five or six.

448
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,150
Can you tell us a bit about how that's been for you?

449
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,150
Alita's been good.

450
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,150
Been, been amazing.

451
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,470
You know, as, at a football club, I think only if you're a part of Alita, you know,

452
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,109
leadership group, you actually get to sit down and, you know, make decisions and talk

453
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,349
about some of the problems around the footy or around your footy club.

454
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:30,490
So to be able to do that away from the footy club, I wish I did it a little bit earlier

455
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,910
because it would have been very helpful with my day to day, you know, as a player as well,

456
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,029
just to get my mind away from it.

457
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,710
But I just have been able to connect my, my group in particular is got a range of people,

458
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,910
you know, we've got people that used to work for AstraZeneca who now moved to a new role.

459
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,470
Um, we've got a guy that runs, you know, some groceries, um, over here in Victoria and,

460
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,470
you know, we've got.

461
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,250
Producers, um, and there's just such a, a wide range of people, um, there's a lady that

462
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,349
runs like a, a charity, um, for, for women and empowerment with women or young women

463
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:03,329
and just to pick their brains and, you know, everyone has the same sort of issues and problems

464
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,089
and that, but everyone's got a different perspective on things.

465
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:11,029
So it's just been refreshing to bring out some topics or, or talk about things and then

466
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,410
someone either has an answer or they look at it differently.

467
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:18,450
So yeah, sometimes I reckon I get tunnel vision and just get real focused on the, you know,

468
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,450
on one thing.

469
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,690
Um, which, you know, is to my detriment, but to have the range of voices around you

470
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,690
is, is awesome.

471
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,210
And I wish everyone had a group like this or had a, you know, an, a leader group in

472
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,210
their life.

473
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,829
Uh, because it just, whether you, I don't know, I went in a bit skeptical at the start

474
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:37,170
thinking, I've done all these leadership things, I don't know whether it's for me and, um,

475
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,009
you know, and then actually getting into it, I don't, I don't want it to end.

476
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,690
So I'm looking at ways to keep it going forever.

477
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,329
And, um, you know, Don Pike, our CEO at the club at West Coast and John Worsfold and a

478
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,329
few others.

479
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:53,670
Justin Langer, there's been so many guys that are, um, have been a part of it and still

480
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,670
to this day, um, speak highly of it and still catch up as a group.

481
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,230
So it means it works.

482
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,109
It's a proven product and it's something that, that I've been so happy that I've been involved

483
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:03,109
with.

484
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,890
Very grateful to have you, have you part of it.

485
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,089
Um, what's Nick Nannanui like as a dad?

486
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,089
You've got two young kids.

487
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,369
Tell us about your leadership on the home front.

488
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,369
Family's been big for me.

489
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,089
Like it's always been a part of my, my makeup.

490
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:17,650
Like I don't know, I think it's probably just a cultural thing where looking after kids

491
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,849
is just a mark.

492
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:22,769
But given you don't get a choice, really, I've always had cousins and everything running

493
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:25,349
through my house and, you know, changing nappies from a young age.

494
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:29,730
So I'm not one of those dads that were grossed out by it even, you know, like, um, but it's

495
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,910
funny cause I, I've actually, retirement has been, you know, it was a difficult decision,

496
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,269
but it's also been one of the best things cause I get to spend time a lot more at home

497
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,529
and see my little ones sort of grow up and developmental changes over the course of months,

498
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,450
um, is, is, is amazing.

499
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,630
So to be able to see them go from crawling or saying their first word or talking as,

500
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,650
as being good, I've got Ezekiel and I've got Zuri.

501
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,829
So I always laugh because they both got the Zs or Zs in their name, but they don't catch

502
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:56,829
any Zs at night.

503
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:01,470
They're wide awake all night, they don't sleep and, um, they drive you mad, but then they

504
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,089
get up and smile at 5am and they just give you a big cuddle or a kiss and all is forgotten

505
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,089
for what happened the night before.

506
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,089
So, um, they're smart.

507
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,630
They know what they're doing, but two under two, there's no TV in my house, I think.

508
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,630
Um, yeah, we're, we're mad.

509
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,630
We, um, yeah, they'll be good.

510
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,630
Everyone always says they'll be great and close when they get older.

511
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,630
But, um, yeah.

512
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,630
Yeah.

513
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,630
Yeah.

514
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,269
I mean, at this point in time, we're in the trenches.

515
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,089
They're not older, they're young, they're full of energy and they want to want to do

516
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,089
things themselves.

517
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:28,769
And, but it's been the best thing like, and it's been a good learning curve and a lead

518
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:29,910
has been a big one for it.

519
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,549
Um, I've always had, I always am curious and wanting to know what to do.

520
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,509
And I always ask most of the time, people, you know, probably expect me to talk footy

521
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:40,789
or talk about, you know, business or things in my life that I've done.

522
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,069
But I asked a lot of parenting advice.

523
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:45,650
I'm like, oh, so, you know, some of the people in my group, we've got four or five kids.

524
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,410
You're like, how do you deal with this?

525
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,490
Or what did you do to do this?

526
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,950
when this was happening and everyone's got their own little hacks

527
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,750
and tricks to do it and you find your groove through that.

528
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,329
And there's not a lot of places you can go for parenting advice.

529
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,930
A lot of us have done it, but they're not really readily available.

530
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,269
I'm a bit like you, you're curious about.

531
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,450
It's probably the thing you want to do best in your life.

532
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:09,250
And I love what you said before, that Buller Fijian way with kids.

533
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,170
And anyone who's ever been to Fiji with their kids, it's magical over there.

534
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,509
The connection that the Fijian people have, even with kids that aren't their own,

535
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:20,029
it's hard to describe, but it's part of the culture.

536
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,589
It's amazing.

537
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:24,950
It's funny, obviously being wintery time now, this is going to sound gross,

538
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,130
but my family, any kid is their kid.

539
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,529
So my sister's kid, my sister and brother-in-law and uncles and aunties

540
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,150
will treat my kids like their own.

541
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:39,730
So I was away the other day and I get this video of my brother-in-law.

542
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:42,250
My little boy is clogged up, so he's so snotty.

543
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,910
And my brother-in-law just gets his mouth over his nose and sucks all the snot out.

544
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:46,509
It's the only way.

545
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:47,450
Because my little fella.

546
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,130
He can't blow his nose, so he's like, it's the only way to decongest him.

547
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:52,130
And everyone laughs.

548
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,829
And I said, that's the Fijian way, but I claim to be Australian when that stuff's happening.

549
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,029
I struggle to do it.

550
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,809
And I explain, you forget sometimes.

551
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,750
You've got things like snot suckers and that in the Western world now,

552
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:06,329
so you don't need to be doing it.

553
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,069
But everyone's just sort of, like you said, just dialed in to do those sort of things

554
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:12,890
because family is the number one most important thing.

555
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,849
And I find it as well.

556
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,349
There's no retirement villages back home in Fiji.

557
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,190
Your family get old.

558
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:20,529
They kind of live in the almost back room.

559
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:21,390
It's almost a granny flat.

560
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:22,369
They look after you.

561
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,150
You look after them when they're no longer able to look after themselves.

562
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,789
So that's always been the way.

563
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,049
So adjusting to community and family life here where it's all sort of set in stone,

564
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,789
where everyone sort of looks after their own is hard at times

565
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:37,210
because I've always been pretty big on just welcoming anyone and everyone.

566
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,769
And my mum was a social worker, so we had so many people who were homeless

567
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:42,950
and that come stay at our house.

568
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,410
Even if we didn't have anything, our door was always open.

569
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,609
I wasn't the biggest fan because I had a twin brother

570
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:48,710
and we always shared everything.

571
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,890
So then to share with others was always tough.

572
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:53,349
But no, I've always had that in my life.

573
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:57,589
So kids have just – they make you have to be selfless

574
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,549
and have to sacrifice a fair bit.

575
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,569
But I think I was well-equipped leading into it.

576
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,509
So life lessons and you go to a place like Fiji

577
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:06,650
or I love the Balinese in the same way.

578
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:07,630
It's all family.

579
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:08,289
It's all connected.

580
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:12,390
As you said, there's no retirement villages in any of those parts of the world.

581
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,450
Nick, I love sitting down with people like you.

582
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,049
You've got –

583
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,150
Yeah.

584
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,210
Yeah.

585
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:15,230
Yeah.

586
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,250
Yeah.

587
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,269
Yeah.

588
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,289
Yeah.

589
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:15,309
Yeah.

590
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:15,349
Yeah.

591
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:15,369
Yeah.

592
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:15,390
Yeah.

593
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,930
There's a lot of incredible patterns of success

594
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,430
and we see these dimensions of leadership we love talking about.

595
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,970
Starting with this idea, it's hard to lead anyone else

596
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,410
unless you understand your own self and self-leadership.

597
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,369
What does that mean to you, Nick?

598
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,829
Yeah, I think just knowing who I am as a person,

599
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,210
I think it's taken a lot of time over the years

600
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,150
just living in a place where your Fijian heritage,

601
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,829
whether it's accepted and it wasn't accepted in certain parts as a youngster,

602
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,789
but then embracing it as I got older and today,

603
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:44,390
that sort of diversity is accepted more than ever.

604
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,789
So I understand.

605
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:51,430
Understanding who I was and what I wanted to be about, having strong morals and values was big for me and sticking to it.

606
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:59,069
I think the unique thing with football is you deal with the CEOs and big corporates and the millionaires and billionaires of the country,

607
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:06,230
but you also deal with just the everyday person that is a consumer or buying a ticket or a membership, and you have such a big impact.

608
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:15,410
So I think finding who I am and not trying to lead like other leaders do, but finding my own niche and leading the way Nick Natanui leads has been the biggest learning for me,

609
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,150
and I'm still doing it, still learning and still developing, and having that at the forefront has helped me be who I am today.

610
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:25,450
And I can see that authentically, you being yourself, Nick comes out in everything you do.

611
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:32,009
We see leaders really conscious of having a positive impact on others every day in their environment, everywhere they turn up, and I can see that in you.

612
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,369
Is that something that you've thought about?

613
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:33,910
Massive.

614
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,490
Yeah, that's big.

615
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,069
I always want to have an impression on someone.

616
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:43,130
When they walk in the room, I've got a big thing on saying hello to every single person, whether you're the cleaner, whether you're a producer, whatever you are.

617
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:50,849
If you're in the room, I want to make everyone feel sort of special or part of things, and that's just the way I am, and it's something that gives me a lot of joy.

618
00:27:51,130 --> 00:28:00,150
And yeah, it's weird because football is a place where you're a role model and you have a lot of responsibility, and some people shy away from it, but I think it's such a privilege.

619
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,869
I went to the children's hospital with Harley Reid and a few other guys at West Coast the other week.

620
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:12,630
And there's a sick kid with cancer who won't eat their food or their veggies and stuff to help with their treatment.

621
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:22,309
The nurses and the mom and dad are telling them to do it, but as soon as a couple of footballers walk in and say, hey, you'll get big muscles and being as strong to do it, and they eat it, I said, that's the biggest power you have in the world.

622
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:32,950
It's superhuman in my eyes because you have so much influence and so much power, both positively and negatively, but to be able to do things like that and impact people's lives is amazing.

623
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,990
I had a guy last week come up.

624
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,690
Two weeks ago, sorry.

625
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,970
Come up.

626
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:41,069
He came up to me and speak to me about how grateful he was for me playing football, and I didn't understand why.

627
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:50,910
I thought he enjoyed the spectacle, but he spoke about he and his dad never had a really good relationship, and he said, oh, what I was able to do was buy a membership for us both.

628
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,369
And he goes, I got to sit next to my dad for two hours.

629
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,549
We used to fight for so long, but two hours every second week, I got to sit in the stands with him.

630
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:01,450
We didn't talk, but at least I knew that I was getting some quality time with my dad.

631
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,789
So he's like, thank you, because there was no other forum where we'd be able to sit in the same room together.

632
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:13,470
So there's different ways you get to impact people's lives in a positive way, and I'm so grateful that my job has allowed me to do that.

633
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,609
And I can see that, Nick.

634
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:19,390
We just walked down, you and I, to the local coffee shop before this started, and you stand out in the crowd.

635
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:25,890
There's no mistaking it, but you've got this sort of happy presence, and even the way you interact with the guy we bought a coffee from before.

636
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,609
You can see he had a smile on his face.

637
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,490
You probably don't even see it walking out.

638
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,309
It's brilliant.

639
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,930
See, leaders are really conscious of the visions that they have and how they go about creating.

640
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,589
And sharing it, you've obviously had some great success.

641
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:43,670
Have you thought about that and maybe going to this next part of your life, creating and sharing the vision that you want for yourself?

642
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,369
Yeah, I think so.

643
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:51,329
I've always been a big one on having a vision or having a goal, and that probably is derived from my mentors as a kid.

644
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,809
My local youth worker, Tony Maracci, was a big one.

645
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:57,309
He used to take us out and teach us the right way.

646
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,069
He used to show us what's going on.

647
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:05,569
There's guys doing drugs or doing bad things in the corner just down the road, but there's a pathway to go and do what you want to do.

648
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:10,529
And myself, Chris, and Michael Walters, we all sat down and wanted to buy our mom's houses.

649
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,269
That was our goal.

650
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,630
So having that vision, I thought it was unattainable.

651
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,369
I thought this is a bit far-fetched, man.

652
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:24,230
I just want to be able to help mom pay this week's rent and rent, not buy a house firstly, but having that end goal.

653
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,990
And there's no straight line.

654
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:33,490
You're always diverting and there's ups and downs, but as long as you have that foresight to go, I want to get to that, it gave me a bit of drive.

655
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,549
And that's sort of what I do now.

656
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,329
I have a vision of what I want to get to.

657
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,769
And I think the biggest thing is understanding that you will fail at times.

658
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:47,069
And if I'm not going to get there, at least I've given it my all and I knew I was doing the right things to put myself there.

659
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:53,309
I think I'd be more upset with myself if I didn't do that and I fell short because I'd just be floating through.

660
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:01,869
So having that vision has been big and sharing it as well and letting people know what I'm about and what I want to do helps open doors

661
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,509
and helps you get to where you want to do because people are out there.

662
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:06,470
They are willing to help.

663
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:14,569
So did you, Sonny Walters and Chris Yaron, as kids talk about wanting to be successful enough to buy your mom's houses to give them that security.

664
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:17,009
That's an amazing thing for kids to talk about.

665
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,809
Oh, it was awesome.

666
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:25,849
And it was our, you know, Frank Caviccio, who was our junior coach and his wife, Sharon, um, and, and, uh, Antonio Mirachi, those guys, they were, they put that in their heads.

667
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:32,009
They said, guys, you know, you can do what your cousins or your mates and they're doing down the road and have an okay job.

668
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,430
Or you can, you can be the first people.

669
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,450
And it was not only, it was bigger than just.

670
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:35,470
Yeah.

671
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:35,509
Yeah.

672
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:36,569
Buying a house for our family.

673
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,170
It was more being the first person in your family to buy a house.

674
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,849
That was a big thing.

675
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,069
No one, you know, no one in my whole family had been to university.

676
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,529
No one had, has been bought a house ever.

677
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:52,670
Um, so to be able to do that and I got to do it, you know, in my early twenties was, that was bigger than any footballing moment, anything.

678
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,950
I still get into those boys cause I got to do it first.

679
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,190
Um, you know, I said, you just, you boys say, but you didn't say it properly or your clubs weren't paying you right.

680
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:04,750
So I, um, no, it was always something proud and, you know, once we'd all ticked it off, it was awesome.

681
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,470
It was amazing.

682
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,089
So for me, I get the most pleasure from that.

683
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,609
And I'm so thankful that I was given a goal or a purpose to do it.

684
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,730
And now in life, I've got the same thing, you know, like I said, it just gives me purpose to do what I do every day.

685
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:25,769
And I think footballers in particular should have that, you know, whether they want to buy a house for their family or buy a new car, there's always a reason why you play.

686
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,710
Finding your why has been a big thing for me for so many years.

687
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:31,390
And I heard you in your retirement speech, you referenced that, didn't you?

688
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,930
You know, like, Oh, you can't take this house away from me.

689
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:35,390
The footy's given me this and I'll be great.

690
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,029
Grateful, regardless of the ups and downs.

691
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,529
It's incredibly powerful.

692
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,329
Curiosity is a word we hear and use a lot.

693
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,970
And we see people like you often really curious about life.

694
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,930
And through that, they try and get better all the time.

695
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,829
Does that resonate with you?

696
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,490
Oh, all the time.

697
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,190
I like to know people's stories, where they're from.

698
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:54,250
With the leader, we had a guy, Michael Hewitt, um, call in from, from Rome of all places.

699
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,430
And, you know, such a, an intellect, such a smart man.

700
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,230
And he spoke about how many books he's read over his lifetime and how many he's written.

701
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,190
And it really humbled me because I was like, okay, I need to step my game up here if I want to get.

702
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,549
You know, even scratch the surface of where he's got to.

703
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,910
And, um, he spoke a lot about curiosity, which is a big thing.

704
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,930
And I, um, yeah, the software of the brain and understanding.

705
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:20,630
Sometimes we, we think we know it all and we just, you know, we get, um, really fixated on just doing it the way we do it.

706
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,430
But, you know, speaking to other people and seeing, Oh, he sees it from that perspective or she, she sees it from that perspective.

707
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:31,809
Then you, you know, that curiosity helps you develop a better, um, outcome, I think.

708
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,450
Um, sometimes we just go in with, Oh, no, this is how it's been done for so long.

709
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,529
This is how it should be done.

710
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,829
And, and sometimes it'll work, but it's so much more powerful and better and allowing people to have input as well as is a big one.

711
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:52,210
I think being, you know, collaboration and letting people, you know, have an input and be curious about different things just makes a better working environment, better life environment.

712
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,269
And I've always been curious.

713
00:33:54,349 --> 00:34:00,569
I've always wanted to know how to, you know, I'm one of those people that will go on YouTube and watch, um, how to do things, not just get it done.

714
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:05,089
Um, then I'll, then I'll end up paying someone to do it anyway, but cause I know I'm bad at it.

715
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:05,230
Yeah.

716
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,289
Yeah.

717
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:05,309
Yeah.

718
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:05,329
Yeah.

719
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:05,349
Yeah.

720
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:05,369
Yeah.

721
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:05,430
Yeah.

722
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,450
Yeah.

723
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:11,429
I always, I always wonder how things work and I always ask questions on, you know, you know, how does a microphone work?

724
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,670
How does a helicopter spin or what, what, what kind of fuel does it run off?

725
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,210
Things like that.

726
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:22,710
So, um, sometimes it's a bit annoying, but I tell you, because I want to know people better and I've got a real genuine interest in, in, in humans and people.

727
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,789
Um, you know, I did a bit of anthropology, um, at uni for my first year and a bit.

728
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,750
Um, and it was something that I just really loved doing.

729
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,789
I've, I've had work with world vision and, um, United nations and, you know, being a.

730
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:54,809
Places like East Africa and, you know, I've been to Israel and to the border and Gaza, those type of places and just meeting with people and hearing their stories and hearing how they got to where they got, because I think that's a powerful way to learn a lot more about the world and, you know, broaden my perspective on the world as well, uh, not be so insular.

731
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,130
So now I've always been curious and I think it's, uh, it's the best trait that I, um, that I have.

732
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,829
I love it, Nick.

733
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,829
And I can hear it come out.

734
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:04,630
Michael, you're glancing, you referenced, um, lucky enough.

735
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,590
To record a podcast.

736
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,710
He's founded the school of thinking with Edward de Bono and lateral thinking.

737
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,929
I curious always about, uh, your ability to change the way you think through other people.

738
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,610
And you explained that really well.

739
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:19,449
You, you, you communicate, uh, really beautifully in your own way.

740
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:23,050
And if you thought about that, the way that you've been able to get your message out and how you communicate it.

741
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:23,889
Yeah.

742
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:32,949
I think the biggest thing is, um, you know, doing things like this, doing podcasts, like I've got a million things in my mind sometimes, you know, um, it's, it's a bad thing cause it keeps me awake at night.

743
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:34,469
But, um, you know, doing.

744
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:42,610
Podcasts or just having conversations with people is, is a great, is a powerful thing because it actually helps me articulate, um, you know, what's going on inside my head.

745
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,389
Cause there's no use having all these great thoughts in your head if you then can't push it out.

746
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:52,989
So finding different avenues to talk about it and do it is, um, oh, it's been so helpful in my life and the leadership part.

747
00:35:52,989 --> 00:36:03,909
I've always been a big advocate of, um, I dunno, as, as, as you know, you walk out into these big stadiums or football arenas and, you know, you do media and things like that, and you have so much.

748
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:04,610
Um,

749
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:15,590
I guess power to do or say whatever you want and people will respect and listen to it, but I was, I've always been a big one on, you've got to lead well at home before you can leave it, lead out in the real world.

750
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,929
And that's something that sometimes gets forgotten at times.

751
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:25,309
I think a lot of people are great leaders, you know, big CEOs and corporates and whatever, and, and good on them, but sometimes I forget to lead at home.

752
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,309
So that's something that I always reflect on.

753
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:33,469
If, if I'm going to be this good or people can see me in a good light out in the public and, you know, praise you for this.

754
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:34,630
How does my family talk?

755
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,929
Talk about me, you know, how did my kids, how did my missus talk about my relationship at home?

756
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:47,070
So that's always been a big one for me, not forgetting, you know, who I am or where I come from and, you know, still give that same energy out to the people that I don't know.

757
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:55,070
So, um, it's a constant battle and I, and I still, you know, I still struggle and learn along the way, but that's something that, you know, is always in the back of my mind.

758
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:02,429
It's such a, it's a brilliant, powerful thing you've just said, Nick, and I often have this discussion, you know, I turned 49, uh, in a couple of months time.

759
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,469
And, you know, like you, you see people that.

760
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:11,590
Excel in the outside world and have great business success, but maybe at the detriment of their home life and their family life.

761
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:20,130
And I think, you know, that's why I love the city across from this incredible Fijian champion who gets family values more than maybe anyone else does.

762
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,650
And you think at the end of it, when it's all over, they talk about the regrets of the dying, isn't it?

763
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:30,849
What would you regret more that I excelled and strive more to be a better CEO or gave more time on the home front?

764
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,949
It sounds like you've understood that at a young age.

765
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,170
Yeah.

766
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:33,449
Yeah.

767
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:34,570
Oh, from a young age for sure.

768
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:44,010
I think, you know, being present is a big part, you know, especially as a father, the, the issues a lot of people can have, um, later on in life is because of the neglect or things they haven't had as a youngster.

769
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:50,409
And, um, I've been very present and, you know, making sure that that's a big thing for me, but I don't know.

770
00:37:50,469 --> 00:38:04,530
I I'd love, like I said, I'd love for my partner to talk about me, you know, as, as well as, you know, someone who's in a commentary box does, um, you know, so I always feel that people have such big connection and big, um, you know, life.

771
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:12,570
Um, things that happen in their world, but I have it with, um, people at their workplace and they forget to have those moments with their own family.

772
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,349
So that's a big, that's a big thing, especially in the football world.

773
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:19,969
You know, you come home full of happiness because you're like, oh man, my mates, we, you know, we trained hard today.

774
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:22,570
Then we, we beat the Bulldogs on the weekend by a hundred points.

775
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:30,289
And, um, you know, you come back one point and, um, and you have, you know, you have all this elation and all this happiness and that.

776
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:34,489
And then, you know, you can go home to your partner who's, you know, been rocking the kids for, you know, seven.

777
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:39,150
Seven hours, you know, no TV, no stimulation, no adult conversations.

778
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:47,230
And I think that's a big part on, on myself and understanding that, you know, lead at home first and be the best role model you can be there.

779
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,090
And then go and translate that out in the, in the business world.

780
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:59,789
So, um, yeah, if you ever see me making a hundred million dollars, um, or 200, whatever it is, um, make sure you come and remind me about that.

781
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:04,590
Because I, I always am a person that seeks feedback and want people to remind.

782
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,869
Me of, Hey, don't just say what you say, actually practice what you preach.

783
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,190
So yeah, I think that's wishful thinking a hundred million, but you know what, I'll be happy with 1 million.

784
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,070
If my family's happy.

785
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,389
Yeah.

786
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:17,869
Beautifully said, uh, Nick, um, how important has collaboration been for you?

787
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:19,030
You mentioned it earlier.

788
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,170
What's it meant to you?

789
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:20,869
Big.

790
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:32,250
And I think, um, through any sort of aspect football and out there in the public, um, just letting people be involved or working with others just broadens your mindset and broadens your ideas.

791
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,610
Like, like I said earlier, you think, you know.

792
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:46,269
Everything, or especially as a young teenage boy, um, or an adolescent, you think, you know, how the world works and it's only until you sit down with a, you know, a 70, 80 year old person that had lived it, lived their life.

793
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:50,530
And, you know, has a wealth of wisdom that you realize that you don't know everything.

794
00:39:50,650 --> 00:40:04,530
Um, and you know, I had this conversation with, uh, probably don't, um, digress a little bit, but I, um, have this conversation with a company that builds, you know, indigenous housing, for instance, up north where I just was, um, a WA and, you know, some of those houses get

795
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:10,070
trashed because some of the communities are, you know, skinning kangaroos inside the house and 20, 30 people living in the house.

796
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:16,889
And I, I challenged them and I said, Hey, do you ever think about building a model that is, um, suitable for an indigenous community?

797
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:30,710
Because, you know, what works in the Western society down here in Perth or in Melbourne or Adelaide, wherever it is, doesn't translate to a, you know, a rural place that's off the grid, um, where these guys are, you know, traditionally nomadic people who live off the land.

798
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,349
They don't have a husband, wife, and kids that live in a house.

799
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,389
They traditionally have cousins.

800
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:40,449
Uncles, everyone passing by and staying in the house and, you know, they want a central meeting place where they can light a fire inside, inside.

801
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,230
So do you ever think about changing the model?

802
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:55,869
And I think, you know, people love hearing that because they, they don't actually sit down, you know, you can sit in a boardroom and throw a million ideas, but until you get amongst the people and, and see what their ideas are and, you know, collaborating with different groups, then you go, oh, I didn't think of that.

803
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:57,110
Like this, this actually might work.

804
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:03,210
So, and I've been a victim and been a, you know, a, a culprit of doing that myself, you know, thinking this is how it should work.

805
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,369
This is, this is the way you do it.

806
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:08,809
But until you work with others and see how, you know, you always have strength in numbers.

807
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,429
Um, and that's probably what becomes from football as well, where, you know, you're only as good as, as your worst player.

808
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:17,150
Like you need everyone to be giving their best on game day.

809
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:27,949
You, you know, you can have two superstars in your team, but, um, you know, if you don't have other guys playing their role and, and, and being a part of it or not buying into the culture, then it can easily be found out.

810
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,429
Yeah.

811
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:29,010
I love what you said.

812
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,070
There isn't, we're ignoring tens of thousands of years of history in remote indigenous communities with an arrogance.

813
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,349
It suggests that we can potentially do it better.

814
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:42,050
And that's the opposite of, of collaboration is an ignoring all the wisdom that's there.

815
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,250
Nick, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

816
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,889
Um, I, it's funny.

817
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:46,889
I thought about this question.

818
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:54,250
I, um, you know, I think of all these people, um, you know, I've had great coaches and, you know, John Worsfold and Adam Simpson and a few others.

819
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,469
And, um, you know, Robbie Wiley's, but you know, the footy world, but I think it's my mom.

820
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,369
I think it is.

821
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:08,329
I look at, I do love to say these guys who have, you know, helped me teach me things, but I don't think mom, anyone's taught me anything better than what mom has.

822
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:15,510
And the sacrifice, the, you know, reconciliation and also the, the understanding, like the forgiveness, I think is a big thing.

823
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,650
Like mom's been a one that could be salty.

824
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,469
A lot of people, cause you know, growing up, we lived in about 60 to 70 houses.

825
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,190
You know what I mean?

826
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:29,030
Like I got drafted to West coast and I was still living in about four or five different houses over that time trying to just, you know, pay rent.

827
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,869
I think the hardest.

828
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:31,070
And I think mom's been the biggest leader.

829
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:36,570
Like we never had, um, uh, Medicare or didn't have access to Centrelink or things like that.

830
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,869
Cause we weren't Australian citizens.

831
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:45,550
So I think mom struggled, but she made it, like I said, made life so seamless and, you know, like every other kid.

832
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:52,389
So, uh, I'd be, it'd be remiss of me to say that, you know, she wasn't the greatest influence and greatest leader in my life.

833
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:53,769
And it's funny.

834
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:59,650
Sometimes you, you think about that cause I, uh, I saw a question the other day and it was about little kids getting interviewed.

835
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:07,210
And it was like, and their parents get interviewed and they pulled them apart and they said, oh, to the mom and dad, who would you be your, you know, your two biggest dinner guests that you'd invite.

836
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:13,150
And yeah, so the parents would be like, oh, LeBron James and who else, uh, Steph Curry.

837
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,809
And they'd think of all these big superstars and their kids, you know, answer the same questions on the microphone.

838
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:19,630
They go, oh, mom and dad.

839
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,429
And you just like, sometimes you forget those who are just right next to you, the closest to you.

840
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:28,210
And they're the most powerful, most influential people in the world yet.

841
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,409
Sometimes we get fascinated.

842
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:34,809
And in awe of, I guess, the stardom and the glamor of those who are out in the, in the public eye.

843
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:36,730
So, mum, mum by far.

844
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,909
What a hero, your mum.

845
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:48,590
And I, you know, to come to Australia for a better life for her to, to go through detention center, to then not leave until she felt comfortable with you and your twin brother were, you know, that's the age 20.

846
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:52,789
Like it's, it's one of the great stories you could imagine, as you said, and to have that in your world.

847
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:58,349
And I can't imagine, as you said, moving from house to house and growing up in, in neighborhoods with the challenges.

848
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:58,989
It's, uh.

849
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:06,429
I'm not surprised at all that they, they, your values, we are a bit obsessed with collaboration, you know, leader, and you've described it as well as anyone I ever have.

850
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:09,789
Is there been anyone that you've thought you've got a range of different things?

851
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:15,190
I know your community work's really important and back in Fiji and now your commercial and entrepreneurial path.

852
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,730
There's been something you thought, God, that's, you know, Nick Nannan who gets access to a lot of people.

853
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,170
Is there been one person you thought you liked to collaborate?

854
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,130
Um, yeah, I, I go to the stardom again.

855
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:28,969
Nah, there's been some like, NBA people and that, that I'd love to, you know, work alongside or speak to and, and pick their brains.

856
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:32,489
Um, I don't want to be dropping names, but there's been some big ones, um.

857
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:33,750
That you've been able to get access to?

858
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,230
I've had access to, yeah, yes.

859
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,750
You've got to drop one for us here, Nick.

860
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,550
No.

861
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,630
I saw you give Mike Tyson a jumper the other day from the West Coast point of view and.

862
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:51,630
Yeah, we get some, yeah, I know Mike's manager, so he, um, yeah, Mike wants to come, come out to Perth and come out to Australia and, um, you know, he's a big boxing fight coming up.

863
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,929
I, I just think you get to meet so many, you know, good people, you know, and especially, you know, the Kelly Slaters of the world.

864
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:58,829
Those type of guys.

865
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,389
Who are just, you know, just the best of the best of what they do.

866
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:07,929
Um, and I've got a real interest in those guys, but I'm trying to think the UN, I've got a real, like I said, I've got a real passion for people.

867
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:11,590
So every year I try to go away to a place that's off the beaten track.

868
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:17,269
So I'll go to, um, refugee camps where there's like a million people in a, you know, the size of the Melbourne CBD.

869
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:23,829
Like just, I go to places like that and it's, you know, through the UN, like we were lucky enough to have Julie Bishop on our board at West Coast.

870
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:27,769
So she's opened up a few doors and allowed me to do some trips and through World Vision.

871
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:28,769
So I think collaborating.

872
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:47,030
With someone at that level where you're able to go into countries, but see sort of everything, not just see the tourist sites, but see how, you know, some of the hardships and that, um, you know, I went to a place where there was famine and no water and things like that in, in Africa and seeing, you know, how, how people were impacting their lives and doing things.

873
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,329
So my dream collaborator would be, yeah, someone of that sort of realm.

874
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,929
Um, and then on the flip side, yeah, I think just great leaders.

875
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,650
Like you see how powerful it is when someone like a Tom Brady comes to town.

876
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:58,750
Yeah.

877
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:03,489
Or, you know, Michael Jordan, if he ever came and did something, you know, how much you'd want to pick his brain.

878
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:06,269
So, um, yeah, I don't know.

879
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:27,670
I sort of go through a mixture of people dealing with, um, real life stuff, but then those who are actually, you know, living, I guess, a similar life to me where they're under, you know, the, the public eye in a, in a town, um, so small and every move is watch, you know, you fill up my car, you get a photo of someone, you, you go to get your shopping in the same sort of thing, you get stopped a couple of times.

880
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,730
So I like.

881
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:35,550
I like picking those people's brains who are in the same position, because then I can go and say, oh, I can implement this in my life, or this is how they did it.

882
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,869
It's not the worst thing, but this is how to do it.

883
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:41,730
But no, in terms of a specific person, I don't think I can give you, give you one.

884
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,570
I love what you said, Nick.

885
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:48,250
And there's, that's to me, sums up sitting across from this incredible athlete we all admired.

886
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:57,849
But I think understanding there's a humanitarian, there's a person who wants to be the best dad and the best partner and influence people, but also, you know, live the best possible life.

887
00:46:57,929 --> 00:46:58,650
It's a, it's a great.

888
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,530
It's a great story, Nick, full of admiration for you.

889
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,289
Appreciate you taking the time.

890
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:09,889
And I, as you said, I'd love to do this again, because I feel like the next chapter of your life might be even more exciting and you can impact so many people in a positive way.

891
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:10,530
So thanks again.

892
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:11,230
Thanks for having me.

893
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:11,610
Cheers, guys.
