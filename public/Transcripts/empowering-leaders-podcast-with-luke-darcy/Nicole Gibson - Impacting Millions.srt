00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,899
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:52,340
Nicole Gibson is a multi-award winning social entrepreneur

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,179
that prefers to be known as an unstoppable messenger

13
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,679
of love and human potential.

14
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,640
At 18 years of age, Nicole established a not-for-profit

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,600
and grew it to sustainability.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,879
At 20 years of age, she was a finalist for the Young Australian of the Year,

17
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,859
listed as one of Australia's top 100 most influential women at 21.

18
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,620
She is a fierce ambassador for mental health innovation and connection

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,560
after recovering from her own terrifying lived experience

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,980
with anorexia nervosa through her teenage years.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,280
Nicole is the CEO of the Rogan Roos Foundation

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,219
and recently completed three terms

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,879
as the youngest Commonwealth Commissioner for Mental Health.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,060
Nicole, it's a great honour and privilege to spend some time with you

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,200
and to catch up in person.

26
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:30,900
Thanks for joining me.

27
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:31,719
Thank you, Luke.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,159
That's an old bio, but it's nice to reminisce on where I was at at that time.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,060
Well, please update it because I want to be fact-checked.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,920
I found myself, Nicole, your own words so articulate,

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
which I really do, but I just feel like the best way to...

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,040
That was beautiful.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,799
...try and bring people back to you is to hear your own words.

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,920
And I have got a slab here, if you can bear with me,

35
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,319
and I want to ask you a question on the back of it.

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,540
But these are some of the words I found in research for you.

37
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,680
Growing up, I had the world at my fingertips.

38
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,780
Attending an excellent school for the arts,

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,599
I majored in theatre whilst pursuing modelling and fashion styling.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,379
An insufferable perfectionist, I was always trapped inside my own rigidity

41
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,240
and ideas of wrong and right.

42
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,060
Excelling at a young age and finding myself in elitist groups,

43
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,919
I could never quite grasp my own opportunities or potential.

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,659
I always felt like a slave to the voice inside my mind,

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,800
that would tell me you are not good enough,

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,020
spiralling me invisibly into an internal war

47
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,039
and engaging in self-destructive behaviours

48
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,039
that were not known by anyone on the outside.

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,900
At 16, and on the fringes of an emotional, mental,

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,219
spiritual and physical breakdown,

51
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,340
I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa,

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,060
extreme amount of anxiety and dissociative tendencies.

53
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,460
I was falling deeper and deeper into the dark.

54
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,539
My extremely low body weight made me feel like

55
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,020
I was walking through life in a haze.

56
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,500
Nothing was ever clear.

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,780
I never felt fully there.

58
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,400
Amazing opportunities were centimetres in front of me.

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,139
Yet I could never quite grasp them

60
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,379
because of my own inability to love myself.

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,159
It's a powerful statement.

62
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,379
I want to jump to your school principal sits you down.

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,520
What happens then?

64
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,419
Yeah, so I, obviously this story is so dear to my heart.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,360
And at that point in my life, I think, you know,

66
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,620
setting the context of how difficult it was

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,680
for people to approach me makes this story

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,060
so much more significant because you look at that situation.

69
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,659
He was a school principal.

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,500
Principal, really alpha dude, you know,

71
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,740
the least likely person actually that I probably

72
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,099
would have thought, you know, to lean in to that conversation.

73
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:34,000
But he approaches me at school and he was visibly nervous,

74
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,439
you know, visibly vulnerable and said to me,

75
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,419
please, can you come and have a conversation with me?

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,919
And I just remember feeling terrified

77
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,000
because no one had really confronted me

78
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,659
about what I was going through.

79
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,060
And I just had the sense that that's what he wanted to talk to me about.

80
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,039
And on one hand, I wanted so much for someone to see my pain,

81
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,060
you know, as we all do, I think, when we're in pain.

82
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,659
But as soon as there was someone right there in front of me seeing that pain,

83
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,500
I wanted to run a million miles in the other direction.

84
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,659
But I followed him to his office and the tension was so intense

85
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,099
that I couldn't even sit across from him as you normally would,

86
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,740
you know, in the principal's office like you and I are sitting right now.

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,319
So instead, just to manage my anxiety,

88
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,379
I went and sat in the corner of his office.

89
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,220
It was quite a big office.

90
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,180
So I could just get some physical distance from the tension.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,060
And I put my head in my hands like I was bracing myself

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,120
because I thought or I felt that I was going to get yelled at or told off,

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,220
you know, because I think the shame I was in,

94
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,639
that was like my assumption.

95
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,939
And I sat there in that position, very defensive position,

96
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,579
and he said to me,

97
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,019
the first words that came out of his mouth when he called him,

98
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:53,819
I'm not here to say that there's anything wrong with what you're going through.

99
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,519
I just want you to know that you're not alone.

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,660
And it's such a simple statement, right?

101
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,439
But it was so powerful for me in that moment.

102
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,639
It was a genuine feeling of like relief

103
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,079
because I always felt so responsible for other people's discomfort,

104
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,079
which was quite a common thing going through,

105
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,459
I guess,

106
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,819
a mental illness that was so physically confronting.

107
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,040
Unlike, I guess,

108
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,199
other mental health challenges,

109
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,699
which is somewhat a lot of the time invisible.

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,819
They can't be seen avertedly,

111
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,199
but anorexia is different.

112
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,920
And I felt like it was a genuine invitation for me to just come as I was.

113
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,899
And so I just cried,

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,500
cried and cried and cried.

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,480
And he just let me cry.

116
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,699
He didn't sort of come and tap me on the back and say,

117
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,420
it's all right, mate,

118
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,300
you know, stop crying.

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
He just let me be.

120
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,279
Which was very healing.

121
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,319
And then he asked me a question,

122
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,300
maybe 10 minutes,

123
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,500
20 minutes into that.

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,100
You know what my favorite thing to do after school is?

125
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,639
And I shook my head through my tears.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,680
And he said,

127
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,579
it always has been since I've been an educator,

128
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,639
is to have a beer when I get home.

129
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
And I was thinking in my mind,

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,980
like, why are you telling me this?

131
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,360
Are you going to say that that's the answer to my problems here?

132
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,439
Or, you know,

133
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,259
where are you going with this?

134
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:14,740
And,

135
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,000
and then he said,

136
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,899
I want to make you a deal,

137
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,420
Nicole.

138
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,600
And he got out a piece of paper from his desk drawer

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
and he wrote on the piece of paper,

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,139
like it was a contract.

141
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,319
I'm not going to have a beer until you hit your weight target.

142
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,399
And he signed it.

143
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,560
And then he got out some sticky tape

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,180
and he put it on the side of his desk.

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,160
And I just looked at it in complete shock,

146
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,639
thinking like,

147
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,500
why would someone sacrifice something they loved,

148
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,759
you know,

149
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,920
something they enjoyed for me?

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,519
And there was so many nuances as to why that was,

151
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,740
was such a beautiful approach.

152
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:46,980
You know,

153
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,079
he didn't directly say evidently is struggling with an eating disorder.

154
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,560
Clearly there's something wrong with you.

155
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,040
He just,

156
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,639
he gave me this commitment that I can see you're struggling and I don't want

157
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,379
you to do it alone.

158
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,360
And this is,

159
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,600
this is what I think I can do to help you feel less alone.

160
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:04,920
So naturally I just said,

161
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,240
why,

162
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,459
why would you do that for me?

163
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,379
And he said,

164
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,459
I'm not going to know what it's like to be a teenage girl going through this,

165
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,519
but I know what it's like to be a human who's struggling and who's struggling

166
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:15,959
alone.

167
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,860
And I just want you to not feel that way.

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,240
And that was a conversation that really in,

169
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,579
in every way changed the trajectory of my life,

170
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,360
potentially saved my life.

171
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,600
Um,

172
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
and it wasn't that it was a magical,

173
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:29,779
you know,

174
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,500
three,

175
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,740
two,

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:30,959
one,

177
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:31,579
now you cured.

178
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,040
It's that through what was a very difficult journey of recovery and

179
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,500
rehabilitation,

180
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:43,120
I had this light of someone who saw something in me that was very human,

181
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,620
that was very real.

182
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,540
And was a constant presence of doesn't matter how clinical this gets,

183
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,079
how many doctors you interact with.

184
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,720
I see you and I believe in you.

185
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,079
What a legend.

186
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:56,779
Legend.

187
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,500
What a,

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,420
what a story of incredible leadership,

189
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,060
as you said,

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,699
from an unlikely source,

191
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,040
you know,

192
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,779
we don't celebrate it.

193
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,160
There are educators enough.

194
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,660
I think when you find someone like that,

195
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,459
seriously to have,

196
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:10,459
you know,

197
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,740
I can imagine him being nervous,

198
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,699
but to,

199
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,420
to step up and do that for you and to get it so right,

200
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,920
I mean,

201
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,420
God,

202
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,620
you,

203
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:16,920
you,

204
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,319
you know,

205
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,519
it's,

206
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,120
it's incredible.

207
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,519
Have you spent time with him?

208
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,720
Is he aware?

209
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:20,920
I mean,

210
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,420
clearly your stories is a really well-known story now.

211
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,819
Is he,

212
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,220
is he understanding of how important that was?

213
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,620
Yeah.

214
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,920
Well,

215
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,120
I,

216
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,519
he's very,

217
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,319
very humble,

218
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,420
really struggles,

219
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,720
I think,

220
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,919
to maybe receive fully the impact that had on me.

221
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,419
And throughout the years,

222
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,720
we definitely saw each other multiple times,

223
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,620
even after I graduated and I would reinforce that.

224
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,820
And,

225
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,120
you know,

226
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,019
he would always say,

227
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:43,220
no,

228
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,620
that was,

229
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,519
it was all you,

230
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:44,820
you know,

231
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,120
I didn't,

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,419
I didn't,

233
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,419
I didn't do anything,

234
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:46,720
you know,

235
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:46,919
and I,

236
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,120
I think that is just a,

237
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,019
another testament to the leadership,

238
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:50,320
you know,

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,620
when you,

240
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,419
when you give,

241
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,120
make sure you're doing it from a place of really wanting to empower the other person.

242
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,919
I've taken so much from that in,

243
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,919
in my own leadership.

244
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,019
We find that the best leaders are,

245
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,620
humility is such a common trait is that they,

246
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,019
you know,

247
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,220
really don't want credit for any of their great examples.

248
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,419
And it doesn't surprise,

249
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,019
as you said,

250
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,620
you don't click your fingers in that conversation and you're healthy again.

251
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:13,919
It's,

252
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,620
can't,

253
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,320
imagine stepping into those shoes,

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,720
but I'm sure recovery from that had enormous amount of pain and ups and downs.

255
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,220
But I read with interest,

256
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,820
you spoke about a defining moment where you flipped your mindset from,

257
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:32,720
this is happening to me and I'm concentrating solely on myself to what can I give to others?

258
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,919
Can you,

259
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,220
can you tell me how you got to,

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
to changing your mindset in that way?

261
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,019
Yeah.

262
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,320
I can try and summarize that.

263
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,220
I think,

264
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,019
you know,

265
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,919
suffering,

266
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,220
well,

267
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,519
there's a distinction that,

268
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,919
that I've now learned to create in my life.

269
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,820
And that's pain really is inevitable,

270
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,120
but suffering is optional.

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,019
And I was in a lot of suffering,

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,019
a lot of suffering that was driven by,

273
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:57,620
yeah,

274
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,820
I think fundamentally this,

275
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,419
this self orientation.

276
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:11,320
And I don't think that's directly addressed enough with people that are struggling the way I was because can obviously seem like a very sensitive or controversial thing to say to someone who's in so much suffering.

277
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,519
You really thinking about yourself a lot,

278
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:13,919
you know,

279
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,320
but actually do think that that is the source of,

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,220
of much suffering,

281
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,519
you know,

282
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:18,720
in,

283
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,919
in people's experience,

284
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,820
because when you start to extend yourself,

285
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,220
all of those insecurities and those challenges of,

286
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,320
am I enough?

287
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
And what am I worth?

288
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,019
And you know,

289
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,620
what value do I have in the world?

290
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,019
It starts to dissipate because your focus is actually on,

291
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,919
on giving.

292
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,019
I think in my instance,

293
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,120
I was forced into this position where my condition was very critical.

294
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,720
So I could have,

295
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,820
I could have lost my life.

296
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:52,820
And I think there's a confrontation there that that's very difficult to explain unless someone's been in a similar situation.

297
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,120
But basically I had to ask myself the question,

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,919
am I actually prepared to potentially die for my idea of identity,

299
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,720
my ego and what else am I meant to do in this life?

300
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,220
You know,

301
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,220
and I'm so blessed that I did have this deep sense that I was destined for more than,

302
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,919
than anorexia.

303
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,620
And I was simultaneously so terrified to know who I was going to be on the other side of that,

304
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,419
because it was such a defining part of who I was at that time.

305
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,019
But I think getting to that place where I had to ask that question,

306
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,720
it was a,

307
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,620
it was in a way,

308
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,220
I guess,

309
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,019
like an awakening,

310
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:40,519
a realization that I didn't want to take that illness all the way through to the nth degree and potentially lose my life.

311
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,919
I wanted to do more with my life.

312
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,620
And my way of really understanding how to get out of myself,

313
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,720
I was so fed up,

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,019
you know,

315
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:55,519
so fed up with the way those insecurities just controlled me,

316
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,120
you know,

317
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,019
and giving was,

318
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,320
you know,

319
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,419
when I started to ask those questions to myself into life,

320
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,320
there was a fire that really started to burn very,

321
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,519
very deeply in me to want to be a value,

322
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,019
you know,

323
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:11,720
to others.

324
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,120
My,

325
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,620
you know,

326
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
I think it's amazing where you've taken that.

327
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Just going back a step,

328
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:15,919
it's,

329
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,220
you know,

330
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,419
I've heard it said before,

331
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:17,720
isn't it?

332
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,120
It's hard to be depressed or in a challenging situation.

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,519
I know this,

334
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:23,919
as you said,

335
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,220
it's a,

336
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,120
it's a hard thing to say,

337
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,419
isn't it?

338
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,620
Effectively you're saying to someone,

339
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,919
you know,

340
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,620
you're being selfish,

341
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:27,919
you know,

342
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,419
and that's,

343
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,419
and far be it from me to do that.

344
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,120
But I think you articulate,

345
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,419
well,

346
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,919
as soon as you start having to think about giving to someone else,

347
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,120
your mind's completely changed immediately,

348
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,419
isn't it?

349
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:37,919
As you said,

350
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,120
it dissipates you.

351
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,419
You,

352
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,720
you go from that extraordinary,

353
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,820
challenging situation to founding a not-for-profit,

354
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,320
um,

355
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,820
18 years of age.

356
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,120
You,

357
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,220
you,

358
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,019
you buy a yellow van from what I read,

359
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,220
and you decide to grab a couple of friends and take off around Australia.

360
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,820
You visit 300 communities,

361
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,419
um,

362
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:54,620
you know,

363
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,620
75,000 people with the idea that you're going to talk about emotional and mental health.

364
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,019
It's a,

365
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,620
it's a big call.

366
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,720
Um,

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,019
to,

368
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,220
what,

369
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,019
what did you discover on that trip?

370
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,220
It strangely seems like such a logical,

371
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,820
you know,

372
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,620
next move.

373
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,820
And I think that that's,

374
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,519
that's been quite,

375
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:10,820
um,

376
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,519
characteristic,

377
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,919
most of my pursuits is,

378
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,320
yeah,

379
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
I guess in hindsight,

380
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,820
it was very bold kind of proposition for me to have at that time.

381
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,120
But I,

382
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,519
I just,

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,220
I saw,

384
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,019
I saw it overcoming it myself.

385
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,620
I saw how many people were in that pain,

386
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:25,919
you know,

387
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,120
that,

388
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,220
that suffering and that there were these cultural reasons why that was the case.

389
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,419
And,

390
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,220
you know,

391
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,419
Luke going back,

392
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:32,620
you know,

393
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:32,919
10,

394
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,220
15 years,

395
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,720
there really was a very common opinion of what mental health challenges actually meant.

396
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
And it was very,

397
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,019
very clinically driven.

398
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:43,320
You know,

399
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,620
the,

400
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,419
the leading thought slash attitude was if you have a mental health challenge,

401
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:49,620
you know,

402
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,820
the best you're going to do is manage it.

403
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,419
You're probably never going to fully overcome it.

404
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,820
And it's most likely a biological predisposition.

405
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,120
Now,

406
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,620
because of the influence I had,

407
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,919
you know,

408
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,620
an amazing principal who's,

409
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,120
who acted as that leader in my life,

410
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,919
breaking free of some of those prisons in myself,

411
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,419
um,

412
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,620
which I'm so thankful for.

413
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,220
It gave me this,

414
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,419
this perspective that actually,

415
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,419
no,

416
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,620
this is for the most part,

417
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,720
cultural and environmental,

418
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,820
but that was not a common way of thinking,

419
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,120
you know,

420
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,820
back then.

421
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,320
And so that was a big part of my inspiration was to,

422
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,519
I didn't think I knew it all.

423
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,220
I wanted to validate that perspective.

424
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,019
And I thought the best way to do that would be to listen to people.

425
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:38,320
And a big part of how we facilitated those workshops during that,

426
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
what became almost a two year tour was to invite people,

427
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,019
into a safe space to share their story.

428
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:44,919
And,

429
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,419
um,

430
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,120
I did a lot more listening than I did,

431
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,620
did speaking and that deeply transformed me because I realized,

432
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,919
you know,

433
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,820
and interestingly,

434
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,519
like the tour went from having,

435
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:55,820
you know,

436
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,519
three,

437
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,220
three or four people,

438
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,419
you know,

439
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,019
maybe show up and kind of through gritted teeth,

440
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:08,120
start to share some of that vulnerabilities to watching this evolution eventually of like 30 people in a workshop,

441
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,019
50 people in a workshop getting invited into businesses.

442
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,820
And universities and watching this expansion,

443
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,419
eventually,

444
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:14,720
you know,

445
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,919
government seeing that we're not so different,

446
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,220
you know,

447
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,620
even,

448
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,320
even when the details of our life are technically different,

449
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,919
we come from different places,

450
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,320
different social class,

451
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,820
gender,

452
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,120
age,

453
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,220
whatever.

454
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,519
When you really give people the space to get down to the core of what's been affecting them.

455
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,720
It's this theme of I don't feel heard.

456
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't feel seen.

457
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,820
I don't know how to,

458
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,419
give love.

459
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:42,720
And I don't know how to receive love.

460
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,519
And it was uniform through every single story.

461
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,620
And once you see that,

462
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
I think anyone would come to the same conclusion.

463
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,720
If they had that exposure,

464
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,419
you realize,

465
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,220
well,

466
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,720
we have a world that's so focused on difference when actually fundamentally,

467
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,519
we all want the same thing.

468
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:57,820
Yeah,

469
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,019
it's an amazing,

470
00:15:59,019 --> 00:15:59,220
you know,

471
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,419
the way that you've summed it up.

472
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,120
You don't have to give love.

473
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,620
I don't have to receive love.

474
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,820
I'll get to love out loud.

475
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,220
And you're in movement.

476
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,519
You're creating the incredible book,

477
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,620
but I think it's what you pointed out,

478
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,519
was reminding people of the stigma of mental health.

479
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:12,919
Wasn't it?

480
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,919
It was just,

481
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,919
I won't employ someone who's got a mental health issue.

482
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,620
I won't,

483
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,720
you know,

484
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,519
that's bad luck that's happened to them.

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,820
They're not really quite right.

486
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,720
And we can hope to support them.

487
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,019
What you've been a huge part of is breaking down that stereotype.

488
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:28,720
And actually,

489
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,419
you know,

490
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:30,620
when you think about mental health,

491
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:30,919
it's,

492
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,320
it's,

493
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,519
it's a,

494
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:33,820
I suppose,

495
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,620
a paradigm or a,

496
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,220
some level,

497
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,220
we've all got a level.

498
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,720
We're all on that spectrum.

499
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,519
That spectrum is,

500
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:40,919
you know,

501
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,620
we wake up some days and we feel terrible.

502
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,220
And whether that becomes a clinical issue,

503
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,720
I think we're united by,

504
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,820
as you pointed out beautifully,

505
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,019
that desire for the same thing.

506
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,220
You move to,

507
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,620
as I said in the intro,

508
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,320
appointed as the youngest ever commissioner for mental health,

509
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,019
youngest commissioner ever by the Commonwealth,

510
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,019
21 years of age.

511
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,419
You serve three terms.

512
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:04,220
Tell me about that experience of going into the,

513
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,519
you know,

514
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,819
big government industry.

515
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,119
Yeah.

516
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,319
I mean,

517
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,920
that was a crazy juxtaposition,

518
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,220
right?

519
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
I went from living in my van.

520
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,519
And,

521
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,519
and working,

522
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:11,720
you know,

523
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,019
and living actually in,

524
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,420
in these remote communities,

525
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,319
which was so grassroots,

526
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,519
like I couldn't have got closer to the core,

527
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:18,920
you know,

528
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
of the essence of the,

529
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,220
the challenge on the,

530
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,119
on the subject of mental health through to advising a $30 billion budget,

531
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:29,420
you know,

532
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,019
and writing recommendations with my fellow commissioners on what that would look like.

533
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,319
It could not have been,

534
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:35,720
you know,

535
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,519
a polar side of that,

536
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,319
that spectrum,

537
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,819
which was incredible,

538
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,619
because having the background I had,

539
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,019
and I continued to do that work,

540
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:44,619
even,

541
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:45,420
even as a commissioner,

542
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,119
I was growing my foundation and visiting communities.

543
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,819
So I'd spend,

544
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:49,519
you know,

545
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,319
a week in a community and then be in Parliament House.

546
00:17:52,319 --> 00:18:00,920
And so I really got to see how the decisions that were being made on the highest level were disconnected from the realities.

547
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,119
And there's a lot I could say about that experience.

548
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,420
Some things were absolutely incredible.

549
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,920
Some of the things that I really walked away with though,

550
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,220
was this deep understanding that policy can change,

551
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,519
you know,

552
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,119
we can rewrite policy.

553
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,819
We can,

554
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:24,920
we can make it illegal to violate human rights or stigmatize people who are dealing with mental health challenges in the workplace.

555
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,819
But fundamentally,

556
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,019
these things don't actually change culture.

557
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,019
They really don't.

558
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,720
And I saw that in a very real way,

559
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,220
just like there are things that are illegal,

560
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,319
but it doesn't necessarily stop someone committing a crime.

561
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:38,720
And so there's,

562
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,720
there's a deep fabric there of what is inspiring or motivating human behavior.

563
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,319
And I really felt that that was not being addressed.

564
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,519
You know,

565
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:54,319
I realized that these issues like mental illness are not actually political issues.

566
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,519
Yes,

567
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,220
the government have a responsibility to build infrastructure and build support,

568
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,119
of course,

569
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,220
but a government cannot,

570
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,019
you know,

571
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,519
inspire a human being to treat someone else with kindness.

572
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,920
And that's where I really actually saw the true need.

573
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,220
That,

574
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,519
that to me is the true need,

575
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,319
but it's one of the most complex problems that you can set out to solve because why people do what they do.

576
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:19,819
Yeah.

577
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,619
There's so many variables to that.

578
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,519
Yeah.

579
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,119
It's a great conversation,

580
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,519
isn't it?

581
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:24,920
I mean,

582
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,220
you,

583
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,519
you,

584
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,420
you sum it up beautifully.

585
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,720
Again,

586
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,319
you can't inspire people to be kind.

587
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,019
We can't force people to be kind,

588
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,220
but you can lead the way.

589
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,519
Yeah.

590
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,319
Can have the example.

591
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,720
I think perhaps the,

592
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,519
uh,

593
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:34,720
the,

594
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,519
the great step was,

595
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,519
was actually getting you at 21 years of age onto a commission,

596
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,619
for 60 year olds and saying,

597
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:40,920
Hey,

598
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,519
we're least acknowledging it's some small step that we need to understand more about how it affects.

599
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:53,420
And I love that opportunity for us to learn from such different backgrounds and at least start there and have conversations,

600
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,220
hopefully like this,

601
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,920
where you're open-minded to,

602
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,819
to learn from people with a whole diverse range of backgrounds.

603
00:19:58,819 --> 00:19:59,619
One of the stories that I,

604
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,319
I love reading about was you sat down with your commissioners early day and you said,

605
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,319
take your shoes off,

606
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,420
uh,

607
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,920
you know,

608
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
come and sit in a acknowledgement circle,

609
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,220
I think,

610
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
is your term.

611
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,819
How was that received by that group?

612
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,519
You know what?

613
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,119
By the end,

614
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,019
it was amazing again,

615
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,819
because it doesn't matter what level you're working on.

616
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,420
There was so much resistance in the beginning,

617
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,720
but,

618
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,920
um,

619
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,119
when,

620
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,319
when you move past that,

621
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,519
you know,

622
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,220
um,

623
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,420
and I think as a facilitator,

624
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,019
what I've learned is you just have to have that much conviction in,

625
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,119
in what you're asking and what you're inviting people into.

626
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,019
And if you're relentless in that conviction,

627
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,019
people will,

628
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,519
you know,

629
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,319
even through,

630
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:36,819
um,

631
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,119
their resistance,

632
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,420
they'll come to the party most of the time,

633
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,920
you know,

634
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,619
like really most of the time.

635
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,220
And in that,

636
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,519
you know,

637
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:45,720
how,

638
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,420
how beautiful to see people that otherwise maybe see each other as,

639
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,519
as against one another or competition to each other to actually still see the humanness,

640
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:55,920
you know,

641
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,720
and the appreciation and what each party saw in the other,

642
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,119
that,

643
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,420
that is the most transformative thing.

644
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,619
You know,

645
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,420
it changes the way people make decisions.

646
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,819
It changes the way,

647
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,519
people work together.

648
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:09,920
And,

649
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
um,

650
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,019
I think fundamentally challenges is imperative.

651
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:20,319
We need systems that have enough polarity and enough difference of opinion that there's no group think,

652
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,420
and we need to be brave enough to challenge each other.

653
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,519
But to be against each other is,

654
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:24,720
uh,

655
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,420
I think a very destructive path.

656
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,920
And,

657
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,720
um,

658
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,220
these activities is my,

659
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,519
you know,

660
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,220
one of my ways of trying to help people overcome that idea that I have to win,

661
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,519
you know,

662
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,920
at the expense of you.

663
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,720
Or I have to be against you in some way.

664
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,119
Yeah.

665
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,319
So again,

666
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:42,819
another,

667
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:43,420
um,

668
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,019
you know,

669
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,119
amazing thing that you're doing,

670
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,619
your community is about all of that,

671
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:46,819
isn't it?

672
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,319
Building a community based on love.

673
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,119
And I,

674
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,519
I'm working my way towards that,

675
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,119
that specific conversation.

676
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,519
But there's another point that I think you sum up really well.

677
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,220
You talk about two choices in life.

678
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,019
You can either live in,

679
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,319
I think you describe it as judgment,

680
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,119
which equals fear or acceptance,

681
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,319
which equals love.

682
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,720
Can you expand on,

683
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,819
on that a bit?

684
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:07,619
It feels a bit like the essence of what you're talking about.

685
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:07,920
Yeah,

686
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,420
totally.

687
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,519
I mean,

688
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,420
so looking at that,

689
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
that model,

690
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,319
um,

691
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:12,720
which is,

692
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,019
you know,

693
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:13,220
it's,

694
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,519
they,

695
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:13,819
they're,

696
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:14,619
they're big concepts.

697
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:16,819
It's my attempt to sort of simplify it.

698
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:17,420
Judgment,

699
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,619
we,

700
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,920
we need to ask ourselves where it comes from because judgment,

701
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,420
our judgmental mind has actually served us really well through our evolution as animals.

702
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
When we were in a state of fear,

703
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
we needed to hunt,

704
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,720
you know,

705
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,319
we were in danger.

706
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:37,220
We move away from the prefrontal cortex and into the most primitive part of our brain so that we can make quick judgments.

707
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,519
You're not,

708
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,920
wanting to stand there for lines,

709
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,720
chasing you and contemplate the meaning of life.

710
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:41,920
You know,

711
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,319
you want to make a very fast judgment.

712
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,019
The challenge is,

713
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:47,519
um,

714
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,720
as we've evolved into a modern day society,

715
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,619
we don't have those physical threats,

716
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,019
you know,

717
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:52,519
as much,

718
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:59,920
but we have a lot of overstimulation and I think a lot of people are feeling consistently unsafe emotionally and psychologically.

719
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,220
You could,

720
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,519
you know,

721
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,720
that's a whole podcast in and of itself,

722
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,119
but what that has created is the same kind of response where people are not,

723
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,819
um,

724
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:13,619
then that they don't have access to the part of them that can accept,

725
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,019
you know,

726
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:14,420
because,

727
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
um,

728
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,619
yeah,

729
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,519
they're under so much stress all the time,

730
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,619
which is the path to more expansion and more unity and,

731
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,619
and more,

732
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,119
more compassion.

733
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,019
And so judgment,

734
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,720
ultimately it's a,

735
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,819
it's a protection and it's a sign that someone's actually in a state of defense and it's a sign that,

736
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:32,119
you know,

737
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,319
they're,

738
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,119
they're needing to protect themselves from something.

739
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,920
But then when you look at how that plays out in society,

740
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,619
it,

741
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,619
it really is quite shocking how many people are in a judgment of themselves,

742
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:43,420
of one another.

743
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,019
And actually there's,

744
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,420
there's nothing to be against,

745
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,720
you know,

746
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,019
when you really were to break it down.

747
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:49,220
Yeah,

748
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,519
there's,

749
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,420
there's nothing,

750
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,220
there's nothing.

751
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,220
That's right.

752
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,420
And you,

753
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,819
and you,

754
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:53,720
and you catch yourself.

755
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,819
Sometimes you sort of walk into a crowd and just,

756
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:56,119
you know,

757
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,819
your brains,

758
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:57,119
you know,

759
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,420
summing people up that,

760
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,519
sizing them up in a second.

761
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:00,819
And,

762
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:01,420
and,

763
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,819
you know,

764
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,420
you stop and you pause and,

765
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,619
you know,

766
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,920
often they're the most interesting people as it turns out.

767
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,220
And,

768
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
and it's,

769
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,420
yeah,

770
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,220
there's a reflex part there that is,

771
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,519
totally,

772
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:10,819
you know,

773
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:11,420
there at the time,

774
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,119
at times that doesn't feel that helpful.

775
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,619
I suppose,

776
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:13,920
you know,

777
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,319
I will go there because,

778
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:15,519
you know,

779
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:15,920
it's a,

780
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
it's a common question.

781
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,119
And I,

782
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,720
and I want to ask you about,

783
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,819
with all the algorithms and social media,

784
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,720
it seems to have turbo charged that,

785
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:23,920
you know,

786
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,319
I speak about my teenage daughter a lot,

787
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,819
particularly when I come across someone like Unicole,

788
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:30,319
because you see,

789
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,019
and the boys too,

790
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:31,420
you know,

791
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,720
teenage boys and that constant,

792
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,220
you know,

793
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,119
judgment is there.

794
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,019
Every second of your day.

795
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,619
And so comparing to unrealistic imagery,

796
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,420
that feels as though it's a quantum shift in what,

797
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:44,619
you know,

798
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,819
the next generation are dealing.

799
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,619
What's your answer to that?

800
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,319
It's a world that we can't put the genie back in the bottle.

801
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,720
What do you make of that?

802
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,519
I think we really need to truly evaluate.

803
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,720
It's almost like we need to,

804
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
how would I say,

805
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,920
we need to extend this conversation because I think this conversation in,

806
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
in some ways has kind of been capped at,

807
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:05,920
well,

808
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,420
we know social media is damaging and then that's the extent of the conversation.

809
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,519
So I just see,

810
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,420
we need to expand that conversation and increase.

811
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:14,619
See,

812
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:15,720
I think it's brilliant at one level.

813
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
I don't operate on it,

814
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
but I love watching how they connect with their friends.

815
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I love how,

816
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,319
you know,

817
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,619
from the year I grew up,

818
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:25,319
how hard it was to organize two people together.

819
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,420
They're amazing communities they form and,

820
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,220
and when it works well and everyone's accepted and included,

821
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,519
it's brilliant.

822
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:31,819
Yeah.

823
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:32,819
It's just the,

824
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:34,619
the one that I look at,

825
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,019
you know,

826
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:36,220
is Snapchat.

827
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,619
I see it through my kids.

828
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,519
It is a drug.

829
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,819
It's amazing.

830
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,420
And they all know where each other are.

831
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,920
Yeah.

832
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,720
And,

833
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,519
and then you sort of think,

834
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,720
what if you're the one person that's being excluded in real time?

835
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,619
You can sit there on your phone and watch everyone else getting together.

836
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:51,319
Like that,

837
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,019
that has got a touch of evil in it that it's hard enough.

838
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,319
And even when you're my age,

839
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:55,720
Nicole,

840
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,019
and you miss out on an invite,

841
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,119
everyone likes to be included,

842
00:25:59,119 --> 00:25:59,420
you know,

843
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,819
it's,

844
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:00,319
it's a,

845
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,420
but when you're 15 or 16 and it's,

846
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,019
it's brutal,

847
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:04,420
isn't it?

848
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,819
Yeah.

849
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:05,220
But I,

850
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,319
we've got to actually ask,

851
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:06,519
like,

852
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,720
what is the,

853
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,920
what is the true longterm effects,

854
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,319
you know,

855
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,319
of these algorithms that essentially reinforcing.

856
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,619
So there's a social component.

857
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,119
And then I think there's,

858
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,720
there's a component of this conversation,

859
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,220
which is really shaping the psychology,

860
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,519
you know,

861
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,019
and the mindset of,

862
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,420
of an entire generation,

863
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:32,619
which is this mindset of having all of what you currently think reinforced consistently.

864
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,220
And I think that's the true danger.

865
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,519
Yes.

866
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,319
There's,

867
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,720
there's challenges with how young people are affected by exclusion,

868
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,019
you know,

869
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:40,819
online bullying,

870
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:43,019
that that's an important conversation,

871
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:52,920
but I almost think that raising a generation that are going to find it increasingly difficult to be present with a difference of opinion.

872
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,019
That to me is,

873
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:58,119
is a very dangerous kind of path that,

874
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,819
that algorithms and the way social media works is,

875
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,920
is reinforcing.

876
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,819
It basically knows what you like,

877
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:06,220
and it will only feed you what it thinks you like.

878
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,119
And so that's not an accurate depiction of reality.

879
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,319
You know,

880
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:10,819
growing up,

881
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:16,220
surely you remember having to listen to people you didn't agree with needing to have those conversations.

882
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,420
It's a,

883
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,720
it's an important part of development.

884
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,519
I think the world at large is actually struggling with this a lot.

885
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:21,920
You know,

886
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,319
the,

887
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:29,319
the willingness to actually listen to people you don't agree with and the push towards convenience,

888
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:29,720
you know,

889
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,319
is,

890
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,920
and the echo chambers that that creates,

891
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,220
I think,

892
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,420
is costing us way more than what it's,

893
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,019
what it's saving us.

894
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:37,319
Yeah,

895
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:37,619
it's a,

896
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:38,920
it's another big discussion.

897
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,720
We've got four podcasts to do with Nicole because all of them,

898
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,519
and I agree,

899
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,019
it feels as though they're out of debate.

900
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:47,619
And having a friend that you have a totally different view on a,

901
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,920
on a matter with used to be the great thing you did together,

902
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,519
catching up,

903
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,420
and then you learn from each other and you're now,

904
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
we hate that person.

905
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,920
We want to cancel that person.

906
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,319
Totally.

907
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,019
We,

908
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,119
you know,

909
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,920
had a federal election recently and people put up their billboards and,

910
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,720
and support and then you're going to,

911
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,119
you know,

912
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,819
graffiti on them,

913
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:06,019
you know,

914
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,119
like you don't have this opportunity now to sort of meet somewhere in the middle.

915
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:10,519
What's,

916
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:10,819
it's,

917
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:11,220
uh,

918
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,619
how can we evolve as a species?

919
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:14,220
If that's,

920
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,519
um,

921
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,619
if the push is always towards having a right opinion and trying to force everyone to,

922
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,420
to think the same,

923
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,619
I think that's,

924
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:22,019
it's,

925
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:22,519
uh,

926
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,619
one of,

927
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,819
one of the most primitive ways actually of,

928
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:27,220
of,

929
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
of operating,

930
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,720
you know,

931
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,420
and I'm going to,

932
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:29,720
um,

933
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,220
I promise you,

934
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,519
I'm getting there to you.

935
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,519
I love this conversation.

936
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,119
We've got a community that you're building,

937
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,119
which is incredible.

938
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,420
And some tech that I want to talk to you about in a moment as well,

939
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,420
which is an incredible,

940
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,720
um,

941
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
creative,

942
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,119
you know,

943
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,119
part of the puzzle,

944
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,619
I think that's missing that,

945
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:43,920
uh,

946
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I know you're in town,

947
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,420
um,

948
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,720
you know,

949
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,819
working on at the moment here in Melbourne.

950
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:49,819
I did just want to ask you a question.

951
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:50,819
We lived through,

952
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:51,319
uh,

953
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:51,819
in Melbourne,

954
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:52,519
the city,

955
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,019
um,

956
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:55,519
I think the longest lockdown in the world.

957
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,819
So that's a stat that's,

958
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:57,119
that's,

959
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,720
that's there.

960
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
And at the end of that,

961
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,819
Nicole,

962
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,420
there was some alarming numbers of eating,

963
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,319
eating disorders in teenage girl explosion.

964
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,519
I think in the last 12 weeks of lockdown,

965
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,420
the numbers,

966
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,720
and I,

967
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,319
you know,

968
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,420
I won't get this quite right,

969
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,220
but it was a six or 700 a week being diagnosed.

970
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,220
And I saw lots of people in my community,

971
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
particularly young girls that were healthy before that,

972
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,920
that weren't to,

973
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,319
to,

974
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,420
to young people listening to this or to parents who've had that on the back of,

975
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,920
um,

976
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,119
of what they've been through you having found your path through,

977
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,920
what would you,

978
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,819
what would you say to them?

979
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:32,319
I've,

980
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:32,920
my heart,

981
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,420
you know,

982
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,720
is,

983
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,819
is obviously so connected to this,

984
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:36,619
to this challenge.

985
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:38,319
And the first thing I'd say is I just,

986
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,819
I,

987
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,720
I really acknowledge and feel every family that's going through that.

988
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,220
And,

989
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,319
um,

990
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,319
it can feel impossible at times,

991
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,319
but just don't,

992
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,720
don't lose connection to seeing that that loved one is healthy and well,

993
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,920
that's the first thing I would say.

994
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,019
The second thing I suppose on a more societal level is we really need to start

995
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,119
asking the question,

996
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,519
why,

997
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:04,920
um,

998
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
why?

999
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Because these things are symptoms,

1000
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,119
you know,

1001
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,720
these things are symptoms of something that's going wrong culturally,

1002
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,319
societally.

1003
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,420
Like it's really no wonder you look at the DNA of an eating disorder.

1004
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,220
Characteristically,

1005
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,019
it's because,

1006
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:18,819
uh,

1007
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,519
someone's feeling out of control.

1008
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,019
And when you,

1009
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,119
when you look around at the world,

1010
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,920
it's no wonder we have a generation of girls and boys that are probably feeling

1011
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,319
so uncertain about what's ahead,

1012
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:29,720
you know,

1013
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,819
or what to expect.

1014
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:31,819
And that's a,

1015
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:33,819
a manifestation of,

1016
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:34,720
of that.

1017
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,519
Um,

1018
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,819
we got to address that.

1019
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,819
Otherwise we're just constantly putting out spot fires,

1020
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:40,119
you know,

1021
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,819
where we're trying to just apply band-aids to something so much deeper.

1022
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:45,319
Uh,

1023
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,519
and how bad is it going to get?

1024
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:46,819
You know,

1025
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:47,119
like,

1026
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:47,319
uh,

1027
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,819
I was reading these,

1028
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,019
uh,

1029
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,220
statistics recently around youth mental health in Australia during,

1030
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,619
during COVID and the effects of the lockdowns.

1031
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,720
And it was eating disorders.

1032
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,920
It was suicide attempts.

1033
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,519
It was calls to kids helpline,

1034
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:00,819
you know,

1035
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:01,619
and I think we've got,

1036
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,319
we've also got to evaluate the,

1037
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,019
the broader impact of,

1038
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:05,819
um,

1039
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,619
increased drug abuse and alcohol abuse in,

1040
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:13,619
in the family dynamics because people were out of work and no,

1041
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:13,720
it's,

1042
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,420
it's such a myriad of challenges.

1043
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,519
Domestic violence increased.

1044
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,220
Um,

1045
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,920
at what point do we start to critically evaluate the effect of these,

1046
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,019
of these decisions in a balanced way?

1047
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,119
And I don't think enough people have been brave enough to have that

1048
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,319
conversation at all.

1049
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:29,819
And in fact,

1050
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,519
that conversation is in a,

1051
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,720
in a convenient conversation.

1052
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
So no one wants to have it because,

1053
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,019
you know,

1054
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,619
it doesn't suit the narrative that those decisions were there to keep us safe.

1055
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:39,220
And you know what?

1056
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,420
I'm sure some of them were,

1057
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,819
you know,

1058
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,019
but as a consequence,

1059
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,019
these things happen and they're not being spoken about out loud.

1060
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,019
They happen in our community.

1061
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,019
And if it,

1062
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:50,119
you're lucky enough that it wasn't your family,

1063
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,920
it was probably luck in some ways,

1064
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,319
you know,

1065
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,019
eight or nine suicides a day,

1066
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,519
Lou that's,

1067
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,019
that's,

1068
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:56,420
and it's,

1069
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,920
I think that was pre COVID.

1070
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
So that's the number one killer,

1071
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,519
22 to 54 year olds.

1072
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,019
In Australia,

1073
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,220
when you think about more than anything else,

1074
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,319
it's been get to the point to take their own life.

1075
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,720
The people that attempt to do that,

1076
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,619
the numbers are catastrophic as well.

1077
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,420
Your solutions,

1078
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,119
maybe too big a word,

1079
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,619
but your contribution to this love is the solution.

1080
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,119
It is just for everyone listening.

1081
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:20,819
There you go.

1082
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:21,220
Exactly.

1083
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,920
Love out loud.

1084
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,220
And again,

1085
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,019
I'm going to use your words because I,

1086
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:26,220
I couldn't go anywhere near doing the job that you do.

1087
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,519
Love out loud is a cutting edge,

1088
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,220
global movement that's shifting humanity's paradigm of fear and painting

1089
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,119
a possibility with a vision to facilitate the world's largest love based

1090
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,920
movement in human history.

1091
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,519
Love is an actionable skill set that can be taught,

1092
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,819
applied and cultivated in each moment.

1093
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:42,720
No exceptions.

1094
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,119
It's time.

1095
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,220
We stopped seeing love as a romanticized cliche and begin to harness its

1096
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,119
power to transform,

1097
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,619
heal and create.

1098
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,220
It's a,

1099
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,519
it's,

1100
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:53,119
it's a incredible vision.

1101
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:53,819
Tell me about it.

1102
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:54,420
Thank you.

1103
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,819
Yeah.

1104
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,119
I mean,

1105
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,119
having the background that we just spoke through,

1106
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,920
it really wasn't this utopian.

1107
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,119
It sounds like a very utopian vision and I suppose it is in essence,

1108
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,920
but it really was through deep observation and evaluating this,

1109
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,619
um,

1110
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:09,920
the,

1111
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,420
the condition we've found ourselves in societally and listening to enough

1112
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,519
people,

1113
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
hundreds of thousands of people over,

1114
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,920
over the years.

1115
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,319
This is the answer.

1116
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,619
It really,

1117
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,720
really is because we can have sophisticated systems,

1118
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:25,920
you know,

1119
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,619
as mentioned,

1120
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,319
we can change policy.

1121
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,619
We can have all of the funding shifts,

1122
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:31,119
you know,

1123
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:31,920
uh,

1124
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,519
we can have more billions of dollars invested into,

1125
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,720
into these challenges.

1126
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,319
But fundamentally,

1127
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:38,619
if,

1128
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,119
uh,

1129
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,019
if we have a world that's void of love and compassion,

1130
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,819
this won't heal.

1131
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:46,619
And so we need to see these things as,

1132
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:47,519
as a skill,

1133
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,319
just like we learn to feed ourselves and,

1134
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:50,720
you know,

1135
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,019
we learn to read and write.

1136
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,019
And this is a,

1137
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,220
this is a skill just like any of those things.

1138
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,019
And anyone that has people in their life that they love,

1139
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:00,420
you would know that it's not always easy,

1140
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,720
easy to love the people you love.

1141
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,519
You don't always like the people you love.

1142
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,119
Um,

1143
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,619
but if you really love them and there's a commitment there to work through

1144
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:09,519
difficulty,

1145
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,519
you're going to find a way to meet them,

1146
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,119
you know,

1147
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,320
in,

1148
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,119
in the middle.

1149
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,619
And this is a very important skill that,

1150
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:15,820
uh,

1151
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,619
that I fear we're at risk of,

1152
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:20,519
of losing for a myriad of different reasons.

1153
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,119
It takes an extension of yourself.

1154
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,619
I think it takes a level of self security to actually love,

1155
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:27,019
you know,

1156
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:27,920
because it's vulnerable.

1157
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:29,320
Um,

1158
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,219
and I don't think this,

1159
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,420
this should be dismissed at all in,

1160
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,820
in the global context of what we really need to start looking at,

1161
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,119
because we can discuss these other major,

1162
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,019
you know,

1163
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:41,219
global challenges,

1164
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,519
um,

1165
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,619
in different areas,

1166
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,219
whether that's governmental or environmental or,

1167
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,219
but really if you were to strip even,

1168
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,619
even all of that back,

1169
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:51,219
um,

1170
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,820
if someone's really in a,

1171
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,920
in a true state of,

1172
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,219
uh,

1173
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,019
awakening,

1174
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:55,519
you know,

1175
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:55,820
and,

1176
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,019
and love these cease to be significant,

1177
00:34:59,019 --> 00:34:59,820
challenges.

1178
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,719
Um,

1179
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:04,219
and yet if you try and address those challenges with fear,

1180
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:07,619
if you try and wrong people or punish people again,

1181
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:08,019
you know,

1182
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,019
because it's void of love,

1183
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,119
we don't respond to it.

1184
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,119
And one of the things that I've seen doing this work now for,

1185
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,420
for many years is a lot of us,

1186
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,219
I think have been conditioned to have this core belief that humans are innately selfish.

1187
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,619
And if we were left to our own devices,

1188
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,019
we would destroy ourselves.

1189
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,519
And I've experienced the opposite.

1190
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,519
Truly when,

1191
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,519
when I've seen people held,

1192
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,119
um,

1193
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,920
beyond restriction and given full safety and love,

1194
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,119
people become more of themselves.

1195
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,820
They come out of themselves more that the best parts of themselves,

1196
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,019
you know,

1197
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:48,519
come online and it's in that place that they have more energy to,

1198
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,019
to be a selfless and to be generous and to,

1199
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
to do the right thing.

1200
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,219
But if they're being held constantly in a frame of contempt or fear,

1201
00:35:58,219 --> 00:35:59,519
or judgment,

1202
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,719
there's no space in that,

1203
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,119
you know,

1204
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:01,420
to,

1205
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,820
to,

1206
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,719
to become more and to become better.

1207
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:16,119
And I love your thoughts about treating it as an actionable skill or something that needs to be,

1208
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:16,619
uh,

1209
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:17,219
practiced.

1210
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,019
And,

1211
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:18,519
uh,

1212
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,619
I can align with that.

1213
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:19,820
I,

1214
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,420
I,

1215
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
if you don't mind,

1216
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,219
I share my own version of,

1217
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,119
of this.

1218
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,420
And I,

1219
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,820
um,

1220
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
a father of four,

1221
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,219
Nicole,

1222
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,619
and I think that the emotion around your own kids is always perhaps the,

1223
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:32,119
you know,

1224
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:32,320
the,

1225
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
the point that the guest,

1226
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,420
you know,

1227
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,019
I remember we had,

1228
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:34,320
you know,

1229
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,920
a health issue with one of our kids and I was at home and I was,

1230
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,619
uh,

1231
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,019
you know,

1232
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,320
not known as a great crier,

1233
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,719
Nicole,

1234
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,519
not a badge of honor,

1235
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,320
but my wife always says boarding school took a fair bit of the emotion out of,

1236
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,719
uh,

1237
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,219
out of you.

1238
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,119
I grew up in a,

1239
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:48,719
in a beautiful,

1240
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,820
incredible relationship.

1241
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,519
My dad,

1242
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,420
my mom turned 70,

1243
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,119
couldn't have had a more brilliant upbringing.

1244
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,719
So beautiful parents.

1245
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,119
But,

1246
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:55,519
um,

1247
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,619
and I just remember thinking,

1248
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:56,920
God,

1249
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,219
my commitment to my own kids,

1250
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,719
but I don't use the word love.

1251
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,019
It wasn't something that had been part of my,

1252
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,119
now I never feel unloved,

1253
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,820
by anyone.

1254
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,119
In fact,

1255
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,019
quite the opposite.

1256
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:06,119
I,

1257
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,519
I felt like I had a really loving upbringing,

1258
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,019
but I made this sort of commitment to myself.

1259
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm going to use that word because I don't.

1260
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,320
And so,

1261
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,119
how long ago was that?

1262
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:14,420
Uh,

1263
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,619
this would be 14 years ago,

1264
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:17,219
13 or 14 years ago.

1265
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:18,320
So you've been on the journey.

1266
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,219
I have.

1267
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:20,519
And it just became this thing.

1268
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,820
I just kept saying to myself and the three boys,

1269
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,119
I love you,

1270
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:23,519
mate.

1271
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:23,719
You know,

1272
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,119
my daughter,

1273
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:24,420
Sienna,

1274
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,219
I say,

1275
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:25,420
you know,

1276
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,119
my beautiful daughter,

1277
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:26,619
I love you.

1278
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,119
You know,

1279
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,719
the most,

1280
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,119
you know,

1281
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:28,619
uh,

1282
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:29,920
and they sort of roll their hearts cause I,

1283
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,219
you know,

1284
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:31,719
say it so often.

1285
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,619
They'll look back on it.

1286
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,019
So often at the time,

1287
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,619
but this is how funny it got in the car.

1288
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,019
Cause I can remember I was practicing,

1289
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:37,119
you know,

1290
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,119
I was practicing saying,

1291
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,820
and even to bet,

1292
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,019
you know,

1293
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:42,119
my wife and an old mate rang and I've been saying,

1294
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:42,320
yeah,

1295
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,519
I love you,

1296
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:42,820
mate.

1297
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,119
I love you,

1298
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,219
mate,

1299
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:43,719
to the boys.

1300
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,519
And so we had this conversation at the end of it.

1301
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,719
I said,

1302
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,820
unbeknownst to me,

1303
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,219
I love you.

1304
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:50,320
I didn't know that I'd said it.

1305
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,820
Hang up.

1306
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,719
I get this call back three minutes later,

1307
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,420
it rings back and he says,

1308
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:54,619
mate,

1309
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:55,719
I just want to say I really love you too,

1310
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,219
mate.

1311
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,119
And I was like,

1312
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,519
this is what changes the world.

1313
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,619
I was like,

1314
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,119
that was a really weird experience.

1315
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:02,320
You know,

1316
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,519
that was not the language that we would use,

1317
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:04,920
but,

1318
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,320
uh,

1319
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,719
it's,

1320
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,219
it's powerful.

1321
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,019
Our youngest,

1322
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:08,519
uh,

1323
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,019
little Maxie's 12 cause he's been born.

1324
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,920
He just expresses that so freely.

1325
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,219
And to the point where it's almost,

1326
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:16,320
you know,

1327
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,920
on the way to school,

1328
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,119
you get six hugs and six,

1329
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:18,420
I love you,

1330
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,719
dad.

1331
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,019
It's like,

1332
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:19,320
Maxie,

1333
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,619
you know,

1334
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:20,719
can you say it too often?

1335
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,019
Maybe Nicole,

1336
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:22,320
I don't know,

1337
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,219
but it was a practice,

1338
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:23,719
you know,

1339
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,320
sort of forcibly try,

1340
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,820
but there's your result right there.

1341
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,619
Your youngest,

1342
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:28,920
your youngest is the,

1343
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,519
you're probably right.

1344
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:29,820
Yeah.

1345
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,019
You know,

1346
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,920
you're practicing probably on the first ones.

1347
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,119
You're working your way out of it and might,

1348
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:34,320
you know,

1349
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,119
fake it to your mate,

1350
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:35,719
not your fight,

1351
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,420
the love for your kids,

1352
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,219
but being the discomfort.

1353
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:38,820
That's right.

1354
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,320
The discomfort.

1355
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,719
Yeah.

1356
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,519
There is a,

1357
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,619
an uncomfortable people with my year and probably people have any really,

1358
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:43,920
isn't it?

1359
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,219
It's always vulnerable.

1360
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:45,619
Yeah.

1361
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:46,019
Yeah.

1362
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,019
And you can practice it.

1363
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:51,920
And is that part of the community you're saying is we got to teach people again that this is,

1364
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,320
you know,

1365
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,820
yeah,

1366
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,320
it's like,

1367
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,619
uh,

1368
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:53,920
that,

1369
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
that's a really nice way of simplifying,

1370
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,019
you know,

1371
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:57,320
the,

1372
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,019
the core message.

1373
00:38:59,019 --> 00:38:59,320
Um,

1374
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,820
I think like the way that I've learned to familiarize myself with love is it's,

1375
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,519
it's actually visceral.

1376
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:06,920
You know,

1377
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,119
I,

1378
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,619
I think about it now is in my body and then,

1379
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:10,820
you know,

1380
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,519
that's a whole other conversation and how many people don't actually have a connection to what they feel.

1381
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,719
And that's seriously problematic for a lot of reasons.

1382
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,420
But when you're in a,

1383
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,619
when you're choosing love,

1384
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:22,820
you feel expansive.

1385
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,420
You feel,

1386
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:23,719
yeah,

1387
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,619
there's a discomfort,

1388
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:26,320
but you feel there's a,

1389
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,920
there's a way for you to actually become expanded.

1390
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,219
There's a,

1391
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:29,920
there's a person.

1392
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,320
And that's,

1393
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,019
that's the ultimately the feeling.

1394
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:35,219
If you can bring that feeling into more of your choices,

1395
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,519
it's not just a better parent or,

1396
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:37,820
you know,

1397
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,519
brother or sister,

1398
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,119
you're a better boss.

1399
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,719
You're a better coworker.

1400
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,320
You're a better stranger on the street.

1401
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,219
You're a better customer to barista.

1402
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,119
Like just being in that expansive state,

1403
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,019
moving out of a state of defense,

1404
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,119
moving out of a state of attack,

1405
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:52,719
which is fear,

1406
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:52,920
you know,

1407
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,219
that contracted state,

1408
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:58,219
the need to judge others really often for no reason,

1409
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,119
just because you don't feel,

1410
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,420
you know,

1411
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,219
good or safe,

1412
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:00,519
you know,

1413
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:04,119
moving away from that way of being which,

1414
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:04,320
you know,

1415
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
when you look at our world,

1416
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,320
that way of being has infiltrated so much of our systems,

1417
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,719
how our,

1418
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,519
how our world's actually been built.

1419
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,719
It's control regulation,

1420
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,519
order punishment.

1421
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,119
If you do the wrong thing,

1422
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,920
there's a whole nother way to live,

1423
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,119
you know,

1424
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,119
and it doesn't,

1425
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,719
it doesn't equal chaos.

1426
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,219
Actually,

1427
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,219
like love is,

1428
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:28,519
is very good at holding boundaries and being fair and being,

1429
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:28,820
you know,

1430
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,820
righteous when it needs to be.

1431
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,719
It's not,

1432
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,019
I think people have this concept that love is kind of airy fairy.

1433
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,019
It's pie in the sky.

1434
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:37,519
Like when,

1435
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,619
when it comes down to it,

1436
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:39,420
it's never going to work,

1437
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,719
but actually think about the love you have for your children.

1438
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,119
You would do anything to make sure that they were safe,

1439
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:45,320
you know,

1440
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,820
and that's the,

1441
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,119
that is the power of love.

1442
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,519
It's actually very strong and it can be soft when it,

1443
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,320
when it needs to be,

1444
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,420
can also be really firm when it needs to be.

1445
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,219
I think we have culturally so many misconceptions around what love is,

1446
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,920
and that dilutes people's connection to its,

1447
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:03,920
to its power.

1448
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:04,920
Yeah.

1449
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,719
Beautifully said.

1450
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,320
Um,

1451
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,219
I hate to take this to where I'm about to now,

1452
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,420
but my mind is,

1453
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,420
is we're in a week and,

1454
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:12,619
you know,

1455
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:14,420
hopefully this conversation will be timeless,

1456
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,019
but we had another horrific mass shooting in America.

1457
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:23,320
An 18 year old lunatic goes into a classroom and murders 18,

1458
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,619
you know,

1459
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:26,320
less than 10 year olds in the most horrific way.

1460
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,019
And I think it is juxtap,

1461
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,519
supposing what you're talking about.

1462
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,219
You're talking the,

1463
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,719
what happens when you,

1464
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,619
you spread love,

1465
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,420
but what do you think when you,

1466
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,019
when you see it in the crazy and,

1467
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:38,420
and then what happens on the back of it,

1468
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,719
it becomes,

1469
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,019
you know,

1470
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,219
the NRA come and,

1471
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:41,519
and,

1472
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,519
and hold rallies for more guns.

1473
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,320
And it's just more anger and more divide.

1474
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,019
And surely,

1475
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,619
surely everyone could unite around school kids getting murdered with assault

1476
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:52,119
rifles.

1477
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,219
And it's the craziest thing in the world and most horrific.

1478
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,619
I mean,

1479
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,119
when you're building a community based on,

1480
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,119
on love,

1481
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,019
what do you think when you say that?

1482
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,320
I mean,

1483
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,719
the first thing that I,

1484
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,920
that I always feel present to is how have we found ourselves at a,

1485
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,420
at a point where it doesn't really seem to matter how tragic or yeah,

1486
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,320
just,

1487
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:23,719
unfair the circumstance is the response can still lack so much humanity and,

1488
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,320
and sensitivity is just what my question is.

1489
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,420
What will it take,

1490
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:27,719
you know,

1491
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,820
for people to actually just,

1492
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,019
you know,

1493
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:36,519
step away from force and actually just to acknowledge and,

1494
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,219
and truly be present with,

1495
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,820
with that circumstance,

1496
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:47,119
because if you're truly present with that circumstance and you connect to just how tragic that is,

1497
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,920
I think that is the transformation that we need to go through as a,

1498
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,019
as a humanity,

1499
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:53,320
not to get,

1500
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,619
you know,

1501
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:54,119
straight away,

1502
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,820
at least on our high horses,

1503
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,719
but to actually face.

1504
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,719
That situation to feel that situation.

1505
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:07,619
Otherwise we risk just always being in this place where we're not humanizing these,

1506
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,019
these experiences.

1507
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,719
We're seeing it as a,

1508
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,320
I don't know,

1509
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,619
just like another statistic.

1510
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,019
You see it in mental health all the time too.

1511
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,719
It's just another statistic and no,

1512
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,219
it's not,

1513
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:19,519
it's,

1514
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,519
it's stories,

1515
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,219
you know,

1516
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:24,219
that there's 18 families.

1517
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:26,619
That's a community.

1518
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:28,420
That would extend to thousands,

1519
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:35,019
if not tens of thousands of people that would have been directly impacted and affected by that tragedy.

1520
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:40,519
We need to learn to actually open our hearts to that because this is what will,

1521
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,119
I believe,

1522
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,820
or what I've seen through my work,

1523
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,619
create real change,

1524
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,420
not seeing it as an opportunity,

1525
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:47,719
you know,

1526
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:48,719
to,

1527
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,719
to have our opinion heard or it happens too much,

1528
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:54,219
I think.

1529
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:54,820
And yeah,

1530
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
I think there's,

1531
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,619
there's a lot of complaints,

1532
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:57,719
a lot of complexity as to why.

1533
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,019
I think people are,

1534
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:00,019
I think deep down,

1535
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,719
probably afraid to feel,

1536
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:01,920
you know,

1537
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
the realities of that.

1538
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,119
There are realities in our world that are really hard to feel,

1539
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,119
but we won't evolve beyond these things.

1540
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,719
We won't evolve beyond violence,

1541
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:12,119
you know,

1542
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,119
war,

1543
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:13,820
corruption,

1544
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,320
until this happens.

1545
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,619
Yeah,

1546
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,119
well said.

1547
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,320
It's,

1548
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,619
yeah,

1549
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:21,820
it's just a extraordinary thing to even get your head around,

1550
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,019
isn't it?

1551
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,420
When you stop and pause and,

1552
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,920
and you're right.

1553
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,219
It's sort of,

1554
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:26,219
it can be,

1555
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:27,619
you can dissociate from it,

1556
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:28,119
you know,

1557
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:38,320
until it's someone connected to you or until it's your family or until it's your daughter with a mental health issue or your kid in a school that's practicing drills so they don't,

1558
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:38,920
you know,

1559
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,820
get shot by a mass shooter.

1560
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,820
It's,

1561
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,519
it's crazy.

1562
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,019
I love,

1563
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:44,519
I love,

1564
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:45,219
love out loud.

1565
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,420
I love the word flow.

1566
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,719
The word flows when you're around you,

1567
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,019
Nicole.

1568
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:54,920
And I think what you explained to me when we spoke a few weeks ago,

1569
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,119
using tech,

1570
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,320
to actually measure this,

1571
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,519
it's,

1572
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:00,920
it's a brilliant creative thing that you're undertaking.

1573
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Can you explain to us what you're,

1574
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,420
what you're trying to do using technology for love?

1575
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,019
Yeah.

1576
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,119
So,

1577
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:07,519
I mean,

1578
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,920
definitely people,

1579
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,719
I think had,

1580
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:11,519
some people had question marks when they,

1581
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,019
they heard that I and the company wanted to move into,

1582
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,519
into tech because it can seem,

1583
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,119
I think the stereotype is that it's so,

1584
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,920
so opposite to,

1585
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,519
to work of humanity.

1586
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,219
But I definitely got to a place where I recognize,

1587
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:25,519
you know,

1588
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:26,820
this message,

1589
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,420
this way of being is,

1590
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,719
it has infinite scale,

1591
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:30,719
but we need a,

1592
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,820
a pathway of distribution that can facilitate that infinite scale.

1593
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,719
And so naturally tech comes into the,

1594
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:38,719
comes into the equation.

1595
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,820
Our vision is that we have 4%,

1596
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,019
which is in physics,

1597
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:44,019
they say critical mass.

1598
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,320
When you have 4% of a population,

1599
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,119
the rest of the population shift.

1600
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,820
So it's sort of hundreds monkey theory style,

1601
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,519
collective consciousness research,

1602
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,219
which is amazing.

1603
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,420
Say 300 to 300,

1604
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,219
350 million people.

1605
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:01,420
If we had that many people engaged and truly living this way,

1606
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,219
we will change the world and it will shift the paradigm of how we,

1607
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,519
how we operate.

1608
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,420
The biggest pain point in our previous model,

1609
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,420
purely just focusing on community building and events was scale.

1610
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,820
And so the question became,

1611
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,019
how do we,

1612
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:19,320
how do we take the essence of what we're really trying to awaken in people

1613
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,320
and put that into a technology that people can replicate and have whenever

1614
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,619
they need it in real time,

1615
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:27,619
which was another pain point.

1616
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,119
We had,

1617
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:28,320
you know,

1618
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,119
we can't hold people in a retreat 24 seven,

1619
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:31,619
you know,

1620
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:32,019
all day,

1621
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:32,420
every day,

1622
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,219
365 days a year.

1623
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:35,920
And that,

1624
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,820
that challenge became a challenge that I was obsessed by,

1625
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,119
you know,

1626
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,219
what if we could give people that power to test the alignment that they have to,

1627
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:50,219
to the decisions that they're making to actually measure integrity.

1628
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:53,320
One thing that my work had historically taught me,

1629
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,119
which I'm so grateful for,

1630
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,420
is concepts like love and truth and integrity can be physiologically measured.

1631
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,519
When you are telling the truth,

1632
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,719
there's a physical response.

1633
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,119
You know,

1634
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,420
there's a somatic response that we can measure when you're in deceit.

1635
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,619
There's a physical response that we can measure.

1636
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:18,119
And so this is taking things that have historically been very elusive and,

1637
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,119
and making them tangible.

1638
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:24,320
And so our tech is basically seeking to measure those things.

1639
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,920
So imagine,

1640
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,420
as a user,

1641
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,619
you can type in a statement.

1642
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:30,920
So maybe the statement is I'm in perfect health.

1643
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,619
And then to actually be able to get a score that will help you understand how in alignment to that statement,

1644
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:38,119
are you,

1645
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,420
because from a conscious mind perspective,

1646
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,420
the conscious mind is only 10% of our experience.

1647
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,420
The other 90% is our nervous system,

1648
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,119
somatic response and our subconscious mind.

1649
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,820
And so a lot of the time,

1650
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,820
what the resistance,

1651
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,420
that people experience,

1652
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,719
you know,

1653
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,019
my passion is obviously the connection to love and fear or,

1654
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:01,219
you know,

1655
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,320
acceptance and judgment,

1656
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,420
but it could be anything,

1657
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:03,619
you know,

1658
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:08,019
like I'm trying to lose weight and I'm going to get up every morning at 6am and go for a run.

1659
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,519
Your snows alarm goes off.

1660
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,519
So your alarm goes off and you press snows.

1661
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,320
And then you wonder like,

1662
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,420
why can't I,

1663
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:15,719
you know,

1664
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:18,719
do the thing that I want to do to get the result I want to get.

1665
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:21,519
And it's not only because you know,

1666
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:23,019
you're lazy or you know,

1667
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:24,119
whatever you tell yourself.

1668
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:24,519
Actually,

1669
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:24,719
there's,

1670
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,820
there's a conflict in your system.

1671
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,719
There's something that your conscious mind is telling you you want,

1672
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:31,519
but in us on a subconscious level,

1673
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,920
there could be a series of beliefs.

1674
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,519
Like I'm not worthy of feeling great,

1675
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,320
for example,

1676
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,519
or I don't know.

1677
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,219
It could be anything.

1678
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:43,920
The subconscious is is a bit of a labyrinth of what you study it.

1679
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,719
And so it's always been very,

1680
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:53,820
I think difficult for human beings to harness the true power of their own consciousness to have a system that's working.

1681
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:59,420
In alignment with itself to get this the conscious subconscious and the body all on the same page.

1682
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,820
That's a space where you don't experience resistance where things actually become easier.

1683
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:14,119
And so our tech is is basically giving people the ability to facilitate that and to to inspire choice,

1684
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,119
you know in in a in a greater way.

1685
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:22,019
I think a lot of people would have noticed in my work is they feel life's happening to them.

1686
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:23,619
They don't feel like they're in the driver's seat.

1687
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:26,119
Of their their life and their destiny.

1688
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,820
And I I know that if people have a tool that helped them actually successfully achieve,

1689
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,119
you know,

1690
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:40,019
the outcomes that they want in their life and they can identify what's blocking them and they can move into a state of flow and alignment with that very quickly.

1691
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:46,519
People are going to understand I'm really powerful and we need a civilization that understands,

1692
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:46,820
you know,

1693
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,119
you're not you're not disempowered as disempowered as you think you are.

1694
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,219
You're powerful and you can make change.

1695
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:53,519
And so,

1696
00:49:53,519 --> 00:50:04,619
that's that's the the mission of the tech is to just be that I guess bridge or training wheels to give people the an insight into their true power.

1697
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:04,920
Yeah,

1698
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,619
it's amazing isn't it?

1699
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:06,219
The idea,

1700
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:06,519
you know,

1701
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:11,119
we're all holding these smart devices in our hands and I think anyone who's felt,

1702
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:11,320
you know,

1703
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,019
the love for a partner or for a child or you can tangibly feel that,

1704
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:16,219
you know,

1705
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:16,820
you're floating,

1706
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,320
you know,

1707
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,119
and to be able to make good decisions based on knowing that feeling because I think your point is a good one when you've lost that feeling.

1708
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,219
Yeah,

1709
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,820
you've got to relearn that feeling again.

1710
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,820
And if you can make decisions in your life based from being close to that feeling,

1711
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,820
I think it's a brilliant extraordinary initiative that you're undertaking and I look forward to seeing it.

1712
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,719
Yeah,

1713
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:42,420
Nicole so much to talk to you about and I could go on for so many different areas,

1714
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,920
but we've been asking range of different lessons.

1715
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,619
This is one of our great passions and the way we're doing it.

1716
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:52,119
A leader Nicole is connecting with just like you did with the,

1717
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,820
the Mental Health Commission to have voices that have got a very different and diverse background.

1718
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,820
And so we're sort of seeing dimensions of leadership that we think are common traits of great leadership.

1719
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:08,519
Your leadership story to me is as powerful as I've heard from 16 years of age to what you are currently doing.

1720
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,920
So please expand as much as you like on any of these answers or as little as you like,

1721
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
but we think all leaders are really got a sense of self-leadership and your journey is full of self-leadership.

1722
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,219
What do you think when I talk to you about self-leadership?

1723
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:21,920
What does it mean?

1724
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,820
Yeah,

1725
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,119
self-leadership.

1726
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:25,519
I mean,

1727
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,420
yeah,

1728
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,820
you're so right that I feel like there's so many ways that you can answer that question.

1729
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,119
The first thing that arises for me,

1730
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,420
I guess that I've had to learn is true.

1731
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,519
Integrity is what you choose when no one's watching,

1732
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:39,920
you know,

1733
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,019
like what will you choose to still live?

1734
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:43,619
You know what?

1735
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,219
What your message is even when you know externally,

1736
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:51,619
there's no reason to and the deeper.

1737
00:51:51,619 --> 00:52:00,519
I've gone into that process and that practice and really devoted myself to what I believe I'm here to do.

1738
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:04,719
These other these other things that I think are important in the subject of self-leadership,

1739
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,420
like like discipline like,

1740
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:06,719
you know,

1741
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,420
effective decision-making and values alignment.

1742
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:17,519
I think all of that starts to sort itself out when you really committed devoted to that message

1743
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:18,920
and it's not it's not always easy.

1744
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,820
I fail all the time,

1745
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,119
you know,

1746
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:21,119
I fail to be loving.

1747
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,420
I failed to be honest when I when I felt really scared at times,

1748
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:33,019
but the mark I think of that responsibility is are you willing to write those wrongs?

1749
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:37,420
Are you willing to have the humility to come back onto the path?

1750
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,019
And the more I've done that,

1751
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:40,619
you know,

1752
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:48,019
the the greater I feel I've been trusted with bigger and bigger responsibilities,

1753
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:50,920
I suppose because I'm proving,

1754
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,219
you know,

1755
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:53,519
my character in those moments.

1756
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:54,420
No doubt about that.

1757
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,619
What an incredible answer.

1758
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:56,219
I love that thought,

1759
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:56,619
isn't it?

1760
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:02,119
It's when no one's looking at you living those same values as a as a sense of self-leadership is incredible.

1761
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:06,019
We see leaders are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment

1762
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,320
and really focus on that.

1763
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,519
You're creating a movement to change global consciousness.

1764
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,320
That's a fair,

1765
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,119
you know thought about positively impacting others.

1766
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,619
So is that really where the essence is for you?

1767
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:20,719
You consciously feel like you're four percent of the population.

1768
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,119
Get these concepts.

1769
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,019
You can really,

1770
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:24,320
you know,

1771
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,619
shift the world in a in a pretty powerful way.

1772
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:26,820
Yeah,

1773
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,719
I believe that like that's that's so real inside of me.

1774
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,320
And it I think definitely makes me on probably,

1775
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,619
you know from the outside sometimes delusional because it's it's already done,

1776
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,920
you know inside of me.

1777
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,119
Yeah,

1778
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:50,619
I think the biggest reminder actually is is to really just love every step and not not always see it.

1779
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:53,219
As I think it as a visionary,

1780
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:53,420
you know,

1781
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,019
maybe you can relate or someone listening can relate.

1782
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:58,519
Sometimes you see things as you know,

1783
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:05,519
the puzzle pieces required to get to your vision and I've had to really actively practice not seeing things as that,

1784
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:05,820
you know,

1785
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,719
and being in my experience and enjoying where I'm at now and not living,

1786
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,920
you know in the in the future of where I want things to be that remains,

1787
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,320
you know,

1788
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,019
a very difficult challenge daily.

1789
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:18,119
Yeah,

1790
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,519
incredible thought that you've got.

1791
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:21,420
And you know,

1792
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,719
the next dimension of leadership.

1793
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,219
We talk about Nicole is leaders.

1794
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,519
You're thinking about how they go about creating and sharing your their vision.

1795
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:29,420
And you know,

1796
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,920
you've done that through a love out loud through your book and through the community.

1797
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,820
You're building it.

1798
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,719
How have you gone about sharing that vision?

1799
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,820
Speaking is like by far.

1800
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:47,519
I think my joy like when I when I can be with people and I can just like this share what's on my heart.

1801
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,320
That's when I feel most in flow.

1802
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,619
When I talk about my vision.

1803
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,019
Um,

1804
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:54,219
yeah,

1805
00:54:54,219 --> 00:54:54,519
I mean,

1806
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:55,119
I think as a leader,

1807
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,320
you've got to be cross-disciplinary as well.

1808
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,820
You've got it.

1809
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,420
You've got to share it across the board.

1810
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:05,820
You've got to consistently be there for your team and remind them what the vision is and,

1811
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,119
you know,

1812
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:10,219
write it effectively and I also make music,

1813
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:10,420
you know,

1814
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,219
that's another outlet.

1815
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:13,619
Yeah,

1816
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:19,219
but I definitely think is as a leader know your sweet spot because the impact I can make speaking to an audience.

1817
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:19,920
I know is,

1818
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,119
is,

1819
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,519
far greater than,

1820
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:21,820
you know,

1821
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,920
other maybe modes of communicating that vision.

1822
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:34,619
And so I'm always striving to spend more time in that sweet spot where I can where I feel I can affect the biggest transformation.

1823
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,619
And we know you read the research,

1824
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:38,619
which you do a lot Nicole,

1825
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:39,019
and you know,

1826
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:49,719
when you know in your organization or any organization or any community that when you create a space with people generally connected and feel like you care about them or love to use your terminology,

1827
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:53,320
that not only makes them more productive and happier and more connected,

1828
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,519
but it goes straight back to their home life and to their family.

1829
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:03,420
And the research will just say that that improves the next generations.

1830
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,019
And so when you're in a position where you can impact people regularly,

1831
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:15,420
it's a massive opportunity and a responsibility and the opposite goes to doesn't when people feel detached from what they do day to day,

1832
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,920
it has an incredibly negative effect.

1833
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,519
So I love the way answer that we see.

1834
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:24,719
Curiosity as a common word that leaders are using and through curiosity,

1835
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:27,420
that's how they approach their their learning and development.

1836
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,719
Does that resonate with you?

1837
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,320
Yeah, to me,

1838
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,519
that's like acceptance of a judgment,

1839
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:31,820
you know,

1840
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,719
when you're when you're away from judgment,

1841
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:45,320
I definitely I'm so curious like I've actually had to learn that my curiosity is maybe a bit atypical because I'll become so interested in in things and it's very innocent,

1842
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:45,619
you know,

1843
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,420
and people I think who haven't learned how to,

1844
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,119
to approach life.

1845
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,519
Curiously can find it intense because we don't have a,

1846
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:53,920
you know,

1847
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,119
I think a population of people generally that have that curiosity,

1848
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,619
but it's so important like a child is so curious and that's that's the sweet spot.

1849
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:04,619
That's when you're learning.

1850
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:10,619
That's when you're absorbing the most insight and information.

1851
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,519
So what do you mean when people find it intense your curiosity?

1852
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:15,320
What's an example of of that?

1853
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,619
I think people if they're not used to it,

1854
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,019
maybe think that it's,

1855
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:19,920
um,

1856
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,420
like there's something behind it,

1857
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:21,820
you know,

1858
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,519
like why are you so interested or but I really do take interest,

1859
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:26,820
you know,

1860
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,420
if I'm spending time with people,

1861
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,619
it doesn't matter,

1862
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:29,920
you know,

1863
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,519
who you are,

1864
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:32,420
what walk of life you're from.

1865
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,820
I'm genuinely fascinated.

1866
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,519
I want to know.

1867
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:42,820
I want to know your story and I actually think that's been one of the greatest assets because it's allowed me to learn so much.

1868
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:48,719
Curiosity really has been that the bridge there to learn when you're not curious.

1869
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:50,119
You're not inquiring,

1870
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:50,320
you know,

1871
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,719
you're not reflecting and not,

1872
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,519
you're not really present.

1873
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:54,920
Yeah,

1874
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:00,320
I think that it's so important as a leader and anyone everyone should practice more curiosity.

1875
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,119
I think well,

1876
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:08,619
I can say that from experience even just the communication we've had in setting up today and and having the great pleasure to talk to you a couple times.

1877
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:09,519
You can feel that in you.

1878
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:15,619
You can generally feel that you're listening and and you're interested in everything and it's it is rare.

1879
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:16,820
That's it's it's you're right.

1880
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,920
There's a presence about that.

1881
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,619
That is pretty special.

1882
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,719
That clearly is a huge part of you.

1883
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,619
We see leaders are very conscious of communicating with clarity.

1884
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:32,219
You need to go and check out Nicole's Ted talk and and that's why I use your language today because it's incredibly clear.

1885
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:33,719
Is that something that you know,

1886
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,320
you've developed in terms of the way you communicate not actively?

1887
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,820
No,

1888
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:43,019
I really it was never something I tried to to have honestly,

1889
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:47,619
I probably would say that it's because I spent so many years listening.

1890
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:52,420
Before I started talking and that's there's something in that,

1891
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:52,619
you know,

1892
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:58,820
I think a lot of the people I look up to have said similar things learn to listen more than you you speak.

1893
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,119
And if you do that,

1894
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,820
there's there's a natural clarity,

1895
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,219
you know that you didn't you're not trying to prove anything,

1896
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:07,019
you know,

1897
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:14,420
like I think that's a big big part of having people receive you as clear when you're clear in your energy,

1898
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,420
you know when you're speaking because you genuinely have something to say,

1899
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:22,719
you genuinely feel like you you can add value to a conversation.

1900
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,119
It then it's it's less convoluted than if you're you know,

1901
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:35,219
trying or forcing or having something to prove and I don't I don't actually think that that clarity is about level of articulation

1902
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:37,619
or having the right words,

1903
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:37,820
you know,

1904
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,920
the perfect words.

1905
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,420
I think it's a it's an energy that everyone you know,

1906
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:47,320
so if you because I've been asked that question before and I feel sometimes,

1907
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,119
when I've been asked that people have been afraid to step into leadership

1908
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:56,119
or lead a conversation because they don't feel like they're articulate enough

1909
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:58,820
or intelligent enough or clear enough,

1910
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,619
but just know that when you are really connected to what you're saying,

1911
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:03,820
you know,

1912
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:08,019
and you really believe in what you're saying people will hear you.

1913
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:08,119
Yeah,

1914
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,619
and you mentioned it twice here the capacity to listen and you know going on tour to listen to people

1915
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,820
and and it's a lost skill really isn't it?

1916
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,320
Totally.

1917
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,219
We spend most of our time,

1918
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,320
so much,

1919
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:24,019
waiting for the last word to finish so we can get our next word in if we're not interrupting someone in the first place

1920
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:25,420
and you can see organizations now,

1921
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,719
smart ones are actually teaching their people going back to listen and understand.

1922
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:32,420
I think that's part of being heard isn't it?

1923
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,119
If you work in a space where that is a skill,

1924
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,320
it's you know,

1925
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,920
I'm not surprised to hear that's been a really important thing for you

1926
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,219
and you can you can feel it and being your presence again.

1927
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:43,619
Thank you.

1928
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:46,219
Collaboration is something we see,

1929
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:50,219
these range of great leaders are really focused on these days.

1930
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:52,219
Collaboration is super important.

1931
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,219
How do you go about collaboration?

1932
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:55,119
Collaboration,

1933
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,420
so hard to do effectively isn't it?

1934
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,719
It is definitely a buzzword.

1935
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,719
What could I contribute to that conversation?

1936
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:04,820
I would say listening.

1937
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,119
Why do you say it's so hard to do effectively is it?

1938
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:16,320
I mean I've worked with a lot of communities right and a part of my job has been to help people collaborate and humans,

1939
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,719
each have a perspective,

1940
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,019
you know,

1941
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:22,719
bringing those perspectives into some kind of unity and Harmony.

1942
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,219
There's always going to be a challenge in that,

1943
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:25,519
you know,

1944
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,219
I experienced it in my team too.

1945
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:32,619
I think collaboration is so powerful when you can get it right,

1946
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:33,119
you know,

1947
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:43,119
of course because the alternative is I guess more of an orthocratic style of being and operating as a company or a community,

1948
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,119
which is one person's mind versus many people's.

1949
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:53,219
Minds I've learned to do it effectively intentionality is really important.

1950
01:01:53,219 --> 01:02:00,420
So having specific times where you where you discuss ideas and then specific times with where you've delegated,

1951
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:00,719
you know,

1952
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,820
and there's actually things that need to be executed.

1953
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,619
Otherwise collaborative leadership models.

1954
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:11,019
I guess what I've noticed is the risk is decisions become really hard.

1955
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,719
So having clarity,

1956
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:13,019
you know,

1957
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:16,119
so that decisions can be made and things can actually be moved forward.

1958
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:20,719
And people I think as a as a leader,

1959
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,920
maybe that wants to be collaborative in your approach.

1960
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,019
You got to remember that the people you're leading also need directiveness,

1961
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:29,320
you know,

1962
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:35,019
sometimes and assertiveness and then there's a balance there that I can't claim to have mastered that,

1963
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:40,019
but I'm very aware that that's something I would like to to master through my leadership journey.

1964
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:40,719
Yeah,

1965
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,219
it's it's it's again a great insight into you're right,

1966
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:44,519
isn't it?

1967
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,219
At some point,

1968
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:45,619
you know,

1969
01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:49,420
if you're running an organization that's got the vision that you've got,

1970
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,820
you've got to make the calls at some point in time,

1971
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:56,519
but that sense that the people who are working with you have a voice and feel like they're being heard.

1972
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,119
That's that feels like the skill to me.

1973
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:58,519
Yeah,

1974
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,219
where the best idea can come from anywhere.

1975
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:02,420
Yeah,

1976
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,920
and if you're not open to hearing that then people don't feel as though and I,

1977
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,219
you know,

1978
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:08,219
we've all worked in places.

1979
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:14,219
I've been around places where it feels like there's only three people that have got all the ideas and everyone else misses out.

1980
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:15,219
So I think,

1981
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:16,219
yeah,

1982
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:17,420
that's pretty limiting.

1983
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:23,019
I've been asking these two questions Nicole to everyone and I'm fascinated with this with you.

1984
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:27,289
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1985
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:28,489
Definitely my principal.

1986
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:29,489
That would be yeah,

1987
01:03:29,489 --> 01:03:30,590
that would be one.

1988
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,489
Um,

1989
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:37,090
who would I say?

1990
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,590
I mean on a personal level,

1991
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:42,190
he's he definitely there's no other leader that's impacted me as much.

1992
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:42,789
Yeah,

1993
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:43,789
pretty hard to go past that,

1994
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:43,989
isn't it?

1995
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:44,190
Yeah,

1996
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,989
it's a very defining for me.

1997
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:46,489
Yeah,

1998
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,690
you still teaching?

1999
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,090
No.

2000
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,690
Yeah.

2001
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,090
Yeah.

2002
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:49,389
Yeah,

2003
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:51,090
retired or is he on a farm?

2004
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:51,489
Really?

2005
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:51,889
Yeah,

2006
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:53,389
living life.

2007
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:54,190
Yeah.

2008
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:59,989
One of the things we really want to do through this format actually is celebrate great educators and you know,

2009
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:01,789
the we think it's under sold a lot.

2010
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:02,690
Um,

2011
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:02,989
my,

2012
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:03,590
uh,

2013
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,989
my great friend Matt Waterwood.

2014
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:16,789
So we started a leader leadership is a great educator and don't feel like we in Australia quite do that well enough and other parts of the world.

2015
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:17,489
Um,

2016
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:19,190
there's a lot more respect for,

2017
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,090
yeah,

2018
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:22,489
people who change people's lives like your principal did.

2019
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:23,690
It's it's it's undersold.

2020
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:24,989
Sometimes in this part of the world,

2021
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:26,989
teachers are expected to be so much,

2022
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:27,590
you know?

2023
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:27,889
Yeah,

2024
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:31,989
I think that that's a big conversation to um,

2025
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:32,690
huh?

2026
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,190
And I think so much needs to change and I do think it will change.

2027
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:46,289
I think we were going to most likely see a huge transformation of a lot of our systems and I hope education is is one of them because what worked,

2028
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:46,690
you know,

2029
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,889
200 years ago training kids,

2030
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:49,590
uh,

2031
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,190
um,

2032
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,090
go into different sort of batches of this factory style education.

2033
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,590
It's just not going to work for how the world is.

2034
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:00,289
And so teachers are naturally not going to be inspired.

2035
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:04,889
I think working in an environment that actually isn't contextually relevant.

2036
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,489
Yeah,

2037
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:08,190
it's disruption for sure.

2038
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:13,989
Does that if you could collaborate in the in the spirit of collaboration going with anyone in the world on anything,

2039
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:14,389
Nicole,

2040
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:14,690
clearly,

2041
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,289
you've got great passion.

2042
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:18,789
Is there is there someone that,

2043
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:22,190
that jumps out at you that you would like to collaborate with?

2044
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,289
That's a huge,

2045
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:24,789
that's a huge question.

2046
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:25,989
Um,

2047
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,789
and depending on,

2048
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:28,090
you know,

2049
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,190
the the space you've got,

2050
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,989
um,

2051
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:32,389
you know,

2052
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:35,090
I think some of Elon's ideas,

2053
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:35,889
um,

2054
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:36,590
in,

2055
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:36,789
you know,

2056
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:41,590
technological advancement and what it's going to take to evolve the human race.

2057
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:47,690
I think he is such a genius and I feel that the message of love out loud and our tech,

2058
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:48,190
um,

2059
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,889
which is called in truth.

2060
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:53,989
I feel like if some of that thinking was to merge with with some of his thinking,

2061
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:58,989
there'd be this amazing kind of hybrid that came out of needing,

2062
01:05:58,989 --> 01:05:59,289
you know,

2063
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,889
to merge human consciousness with artificial intelligence.

2064
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:10,690
I don't think that that has to be the way I don't think we need to lose what's fundamentally true about the human spirit to to evolve.

2065
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,190
So I'd love to start,

2066
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:12,489
you know,

2067
01:06:12,489 --> 01:06:17,690
working in that space more and this is my next big challenge,

2068
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:17,889
you know,

2069
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:25,690
as a leader is to be young female tech founder wanting to take on really like some of the most powerful people in the world.

2070
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,889
And I've got a book coming out in a couple of months,

2071
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:28,989
um,

2072
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:43,889
titled legacy disorder and it's written for some of these characters in the world that I just feel maybe need to rethink what legacy means and to really start asking deeper questions about how their ideas of legacy,

2073
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:44,889
uh,

2074
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:47,489
influencing the direction of our evolution.

2075
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:48,989
Yeah,

2076
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:50,989
I can't wait to read that.

2077
01:06:50,989 --> 01:06:51,389
I mean,

2078
01:06:51,389 --> 01:06:53,489
Elon comes up as semi regularly.

2079
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:53,789
Really?

2080
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:54,090
You know,

2081
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:54,489
I think,

2082
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:55,289
uh,

2083
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:55,590
you know,

2084
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,190
there's not,

2085
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,289
he's on the leading edge.

2086
01:06:57,289 --> 01:06:57,989
That's why.

2087
01:06:58,289 --> 01:06:58,690
Yeah.

2088
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:03,690
And he's transformed things that other people thought was way too hard to go.

2089
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,289
I mean,

2090
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:04,590
you know,

2091
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:11,989
all the car manufacturers had the electric car available to them and everyone sort of laughed at him with Tesla and launching,

2092
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:12,389
uh,

2093
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:14,789
SpaceX and taking on NASA and,

2094
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:15,289
you know,

2095
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:17,190
there's clearly some genius there,

2096
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,489
isn't there?

2097
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:17,590
Yeah.

2098
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:18,190
Huge.

2099
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:18,489
It's,

2100
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:18,989
um,

2101
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:20,389
and so committed,

2102
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:20,690
you know,

2103
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:21,090
you can,

2104
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,989
you can see in everything.

2105
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:22,889
One of his interviews,

2106
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:23,789
he's given,

2107
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:27,190
he has given so much to his,

2108
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,289
his vision and his mission.

2109
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:29,989
Yeah.

2110
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:31,190

2111

2113
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:33,489
for the love out loud world and,

2114
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:33,889
uh,

2115
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:35,389
and what you're doing in the tech space.

2116
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:35,789
Um,

2117
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:35,989
you know,

2118
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:38,789
I feel like when you have the great pleasure to spend some time with you,
