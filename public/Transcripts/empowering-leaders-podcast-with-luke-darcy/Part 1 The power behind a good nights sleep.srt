00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello and welcome to a very special episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,019
We are constantly inspired in the work we do at Alita by the great people in our community,

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,000
many of whom have appeared on this podcast and the common threads that appear when you

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,980
speak to people who've had successful lives.

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,660
We are really passionate about growing this Alita community.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,780
We bring together groups of five to six people from diverse backgrounds to come together

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,359
to learn and to connect and to share.

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,399
We'd love to collaborate with you if you're interested in joining our Alita Connect community

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,640
have a look at our website head to alitacollective.com book a discovery call today love to chat to

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,479
you and one of those common threads is the idea that great sleep is really important

11
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,859
for a successful life.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,920
Couldn't believe in recording this sleep special that if you're lucky enough to live to 90

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,020
years of age 30 of those years will be asleep so understanding sleep, sleep routines and

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,000
sleep health might be the most important thing you listen to this year.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,380
Way back many thousands of years ago in my studies sleep being one of the three

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,000
pillars of health and well-being a lot has been uncovered about the role of sleep in not only

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,680
optimizing brain health but health in all aspects of the body it's just as important as daily

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,459
exercise there is nothing more necessary to a human than sleep that's it sleep is the most

19
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,280
underutilized natural performance enhancer that we have we're going to hear from dr elise face

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,019
a child's phd who works with elite athletes

21
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,219
including the melbourne storm the oracle green edge cycling team secure to football club and

22
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:42,060
also business leaders through her work at monash university as the founder of peak sleep to elite

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,599
with a focus on optimizing sleep and body clocks for better health mindset and performance it was

24
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:54,680
great to have elise join us dr troy flanagan phd has an aerospace engineering background and also

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,459
is the head of high performance for the nba's milwaukee bucks had the privilege of interviewing

26
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,299
troy on the podcast earlier this year.

27
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,900
and it was excellent to get him back as part of this special to enlighten us on the sleep regime

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:13,419
of some of the best athletes and astronauts in the world dr shanta raja atnam professor of sleep

29
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,960
and circadian medicine is one of the world's globally renowned sleep experts and researchers

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,060
whose focus on designing treatment approaches for sleep disorders caused by biological clock

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,620
disruption is a world-leading voice on this topic and you're going to enjoy the conversation

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,300
with shanta dr daniel.

33
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,080
dr troy flanagan phd has an aerospace engineering background and also is the founder of peak sleep

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,000
better known as dr golly pediatrician and former chief resident medical officer of the royal

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,080
children's hospital dr golly has worked with thousands of babies and parents over more than

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,159
a decade of practice guiding whole families towards a full night's sleep and he is a very

37
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,120
important voice on this topic mark bunn joins us as well former afl player and now ayurvedic health

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,780
leader who has written one of the world's leading novels on ancient wisdom for modern health

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,360
he gives us a great insight into combining those worlds of eastern health and modern health

40
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,780
and western science bringing forward the understanding lessons learned from thousands

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,000
of years of humankind trying to get the best possible night's sleep and you think of evolution

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
it's not as though people need less sleep a thousand years on it's something that we all

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,280
require and mark's a great voice on this topic i always thought traditionally that i was a really

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,280
good sleeper but i have to say these conversations have fundamentally changed the way i think about

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
sleep and now talking to my kids about how they can approach sleep in an even better way than

46
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,680
i have in the past i'm hoping that by listening you'll also gain a lot of insight on how you can

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,680
optimize your own sleep in order to improve your life in a profound way this sleep special is

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,539
proudly brought to you by temper mattresses adjustable bases and pillows the difference

49
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:52,180
is temper huge thanks to jason nicholas and the team from temper for their ongoing support

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:00,500
and it is a mattress like no other we began by discussing the importance of sleep and what it

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,659
means to us humans and shanta got straight to the point

52
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:12,599
we devote about a third of our lives to sleep if we live to the age of 90 we will spend about 30

53
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:21,639
years asleep throughout the course of evolution this function has been preserved it must play a

54
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,360
critical function to preserving our health otherwise it would have become redundant

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,639
but it hasn't and so that suggested to me that we have a long way to go

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,800
in our discovery about the importance of sleep health over the past three decades or so

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,060
a lot has been uncovered about the role of sleep in not only optimizing brain health

58
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:56,459
but health in all aspects of of the body and so we know now that sleep plays a critical role

59
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:03,339
in maintaining our cognitive functions our mental health but also

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,379
every system in the body is affected by sleep disturbance and sleep plays therefore

61
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,860
an important role in preserving you know from everything from cardiovascular health

62
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,560
to metabolic health and so on mark barn as someone that has studied health in depth

63
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,939
how important a role does sleep play oh absolutely fundamental does way back many

64
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:33,199
thousands of years ago in my studies um ayurvedic medicine they actually had texts that

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,139
went into great detail about sleep being one of the three pillars of health and well-being obviously

66
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,720
things like diet and is very important but you know we can all appreciate in our modern world

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,480
we have a very strong focus on activity and performance and high level performance and

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,360
when we take a step back and consider sleep from that level we um can look at mother nature and

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,600
mother nature has these two core pillars and that is rest and activity you know we need winter to

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,699
balance summer we need night to balance day and night to balance day and night to balance day and

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:11,019
so from many traditional cultures and long-living cultures they have just as much respect and

72
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:17,079
honor and acknowledgement of the importance of deep rest as they do for dynamic sort of

73
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,800
outward activity so um really important someone once described sleep deprivation to me as

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,860
being almost worse than smoking or alcoholism that the continual lack of sleep is incredibly

75
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,699
detrimental to your health is that something you subscribe to absolutely yeah and even if you're

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,040
on a diet and um research over the last decade or two they now have an understanding what's known as

77
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,779
functional holes in the brain so we think of the brain we think of a sort of solid mass but in terms

78
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,980
of neuron neuronal connections and how the brain functions you can actually have or develop holes

79
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,660
in that you know long-term cigarette smoking drug abuse and sleep deprivation is right up there with

80
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,560
that so we still have a brain the neurons are still there but they just don't communicate with

81
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
each other so um

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,180
yeah no i'd definitely uh back that up and dr golly let me turn to you people have always said

83
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,939
in the past you've just got to grind your way through everyone goes through it and you've

84
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:17,199
effectively got to suck it up but we know sleep deprivation is incredibly bad for your health and

85
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,939
your overall well-being is that how you view it there is nothing more necessary to a human

86
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:31,839
than sleep that's it you know i do a lot of talks at um football clubs uh basketball clubs netball

87
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,699
we i've given talks about sleep deprivation and sleep deprivation and i've given talks about sleep

88
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,839
and sleep deprivation and sleep deprivation at orica and l'oreal and you know publicist these

89
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,680
companies are understanding more and more and sporting clubs when we're talking about high

90
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,180
performance are understanding more and more that sleep is paramount you know for a corporate to

91
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,019
turn around and say we are going to bring you in to talk to our new families and expectant families

92
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,180
about the importance of sleep you know they're onto something so if you can improve your sleep

93
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,839
it's a no-brainer it improves performance

94
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,300
statistics that come out of the research into how much businesses lose because of their staff

95
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,720
having poor sleep in terms of sick days, in terms of mistakes being made, and poor retention as

96
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,879
well. It's absolutely undeniable that sleep is paramount. Anyone who's a parent, anyone who's

97
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,339
gone through poor sleep for whatever reason will tell you that their performance suffers.

98
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:35,299
There's no question. It's equivocal, you know, the effect of sleep deprivation with being drunk

99
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:42,720
or having really, really uncontrolled ADHD. Performance absolutely drops, cognition drops,

100
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,139
recall drops, everything drops when we're not sleeping well, not to mention the fact that

101
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,700
we're more likely to get sick and then have days when we're not working. So the answer to your

102
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,320
question is a definitive yes. At least it used to be considered somewhat a badge of honor to say

103
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,200
that I don't need sleep or I can get away with little or no sleep. People used to boast about

104
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,139
it, didn't they, in a way? It was, as you said, like a badge of honor. I think the tide has turned

105
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,279
a little bit on that one. And I think in elite sport, that is a real area where, you know,

106
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,240
it's good for individual athletes for their own performance and health, but athletes, elite

107
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,100
athletes can act as role models for the community and for other people around them. And if we look

108
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,000
at, you know, how LeBron James talks about his sleep and how he prioritizes

109
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,220
it and how much time he spends on it, think how many people that gets disseminated to and then

110
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,940
that think more about their sleep. So I think there's a lot that us scientists and researchers

111
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,679
and consultants can do, but it's important as well to acknowledge that the reach that some

112
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,940
elite athletes have can have a real impact, similar with, you know, mental health in sports

113
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,299
and how Simone Biles has, you know, openly and a lot of other athletes have openly spoken about,

114
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,500
about their troubles and how that is helping to kind of normalize and allow other people to share

115
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,759
their story as well. I don't know if you know this one, how many hours does LeBron James sleep a night?

116
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,879
I know he invests enormous amounts of money in his own, you know, routines and habits. So let

117
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,440
me have a guess. I don't know, but nine hours? More.

118
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,519
10? More.

119
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,639
He's sleeping more than 10 hours a night. 11 hours, LeBron?

120
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,899
Kind of.

121
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,960
Sleeps about 10 hours a night. Obviously, I'm not studying him. I'm not going to try and claim that

122
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,779
this is, this is just what I've heard, but around 10 hours and then has a nap during the day as

123
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,820
well. So total around 12 hours, maybe over a 24 hour period.

124
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,279
So he's going to spend 45 years asleep, LeBron, the way he's tracking as a professional athlete.

125
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,940
Well, we look at the success he's had.

126
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,539
At his 40 years of age and still playing at the top of his game. And when you're working with

127
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,279
elite athletes to improve their sleep.

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,259
What are the common things that you're often sharing with them to improve sleep?

129
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,899
I feel like the sleep field, well, for one, sleep in sport has become huge over the last

130
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,139
five to 10 years. You know, everyone has seen this really big increase in the

131
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:19,019
interest in sleep and a push towards integrating sleep into high performance and considering it.

132
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,139
What I think is still missing is there's been quite a generalized approach. And we see this

133
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:27,279
with sleep health.

134
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,620
In the general population, but also in, in elite sport is that there's very kind of generic

135
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,159
advice and recommendations that are given, you know, sure sleep a certain amount of time and

136
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:46,600
at these times. And I really think that what most, I think all sleep, sleep researchers would,

137
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:53,379
would agree. There's no one size fits all. As we move towards more of individualized medicine,

138
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:57,259
sleep needs to go with that as well. And it really,

139
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,000
really depends on the individual in terms of what their sleep presentations are or their

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
difficulties with sleep and then how you manage it.

141
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,299
Elise, how big a benefit can you get as a high performing athlete or in life in general by

142
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,259
achieving really good sleep? How, how, how big a factor is it in your mind?

143
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,960
I think this is said quite a lot and I do use it quite a bit, but I think sleep is

144
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,519
the most underutilized natural performance enhancer that we have.

145
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,299
The funny thing is, I think sleep is the most underutilized natural performance enhancer that we have.

146
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:32,399
It's free. You know, it's not on the anti-doping. It's not illicit substance. It's not,

147
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:39,360
you know, any of those, those things it's free and we're not using it enough, I think. And

148
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,559
especially in elite sport, most athletes, you know, are going to be in that range of

149
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,480
pretty good, healthy sleep. Probably, you know, you will, you'll have a small percentage that

150
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,500
have a clinical sleep issue that needs to be managed, diagnosed and managed.

151
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,399
But a lot of athletes are in that kind of good sleep range. What we want to look at is

152
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:10,679
how we can optimize that. Like, can we increase that a little bit to then try and improve recovery

153
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:17,519
and performance? And if we think of it just in terms of proportion of time that you spend sleeping

154
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,559
versus other activities, you know, 33% of our time we should spend sleeping. So to put that

155
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,440
in proportion across...

156
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,720
If you live until you're 90, 30 years of those, you'll be sleeping or expected to be asleep.

157
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,899
And if we look at that in proportion to other activities, like time you actually spend

158
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,980
exercising, training, competing as an athlete, that's probably a couple of percent. If we look

159
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,059
at the number of minutes that you're in the gym or out on the ground or on the court compared to

160
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:54,700
the time that you're spending sleeping, that is a huge difference. So I think we haven't tapped

161
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,879
into that enough.

162
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,419
And again, in your role as the head of high performance at the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA,

163
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,279
your bedtime with the team can be any time between 1am and 5am, depending on the schedule

164
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,960
and the roster and the travel. You've got elite athletes that mightn't get to bed until 3, 4,

165
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,419
5am after a game. So what do you do the next day with elite athletes so that they can function

166
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,639
on that sort of schedule?

167
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,899
The short answer is they have what we call an NBA nap. And it really depends on

168
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,679
what they need. Do they need physical recovery? Well, that determines what type of nap they have.

169
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,000
Or if they need cognitive or brain recovery, that determines what type of nap they need.

170
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:48,980
And so the shorter naps, under 30 minutes, are more about the physical side. The 30 to 60 is

171
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,580
more of your deep sleep type of nap. And that's where you start to get a little bit more physical.

172
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,379
But then...

173
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:04,279
And the 90 minute, like a full sleep cycle, that's where you get the whole physical and mental and

174
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,899
brain function recovery. So it really depends on what you're looking for as to what type of nap

175
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,320
that you have the next day. But even a 15 minute nap, where you just go into the first phase of

176
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,799
sleep cycle, that we call it the light or the non-REM light phase, that can just totally change

177
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,720
your energy levels. And so...

178
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,100
So there are different types of naps that you can take. And it's okay to do that. But one of the

179
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:40,820
things I find as a busy executive is sometimes it's the middle of the day. And there's no other

180
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,200
place to put it. And we're on the road with the team. And you just kind of feel guilty that you're

181
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:53,059
taking a 15 minute nap when you perhaps should be working. And so you really have to have a plan

182
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,480
is kind of the number one thing. And you have to periodize.

183
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,740
What is my schedule coming up? And where am I going to catch up knowing that I'm going to be in

184
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,120
deficit on day two and day three away? And then you can start to schedule it and feel okay about it.

185
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,419
And do you think, Troy, we need to actually have a better conversation around sleep? If you're an

186
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,620
exec that's had to work overnight or be at a late function or work on a schedule like you,

187
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,899
you're seriously going to be more effective with that 15 minute power nap the next day.

188
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,940
Do we need people to understand actually what you're doing

189
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,220
or productive by having that nap than trying to push through? Is that a conversation we need to

190
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:38,700
have? Yeah, I think it's just as important as daily exercise and periodizing when you're in

191
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:48,480
sleep deficit or sleep debt. It's okay to structure that during a lunch break or when we go into the

192
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,539
morning. As soon as we get back and have lunch, we send all the players to bed and they try and

193
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:56,460
get through a full.

194
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,320
Sleep cycle. And then they come back, get back on court, play a game that night. And they're

195
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,480
highly structured in the way that they do that and super effective at doing it. And when they

196
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,200
don't get it, they actually get quite concerned. And so I think that we empower people, particularly

197
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,539
an NBA team, to go and get rest because we need you at your best tonight at 9 p.m.

198
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,900
So Troy, to break that down a little bit, I think we've all been in that scenario where you've lost

199
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,480
some sleep. You might jump into bed during the night. You might get up in the morning and you're

200
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,819
like, okay, I'm going to sleep for the rest of the day. Is sleep maybe what feels like a bit too

201
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:33,980
long? And you wake up and you never can get back on the right foot for the rest of the day. Are you

202
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,599
really detailed in, right, this is a 60-minute sleep or a 90-minute sleep? And do you put alarms

203
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:47,519
around making sure that you don't sleep too long? Yeah. So I think I have to just quickly describe

204
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,059
the different types of sleep. So just to go into it really simply, there's light, moderate, and

205
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,480
deep sleep, right? So light is between moderate and deep sleep. And then there's light, moderate,

206
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,559
you know, one to five minutes or up to 15 minutes of sleep. That's that quick nap that you might

207
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,819
take as your plane's taking off. You just fall asleep for 15 minutes and wake up when you take

208
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:12,200
off, right? The moderate is kind of like the 10 to 25 minutes. So that's the nap that most people

209
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:20,259
will take. And then the deep sleep is between, you know, 20 to 40 minutes. And that's where you

210
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:26,259
can actually wake up and feel a little groggy. And so that's the nap that we usually try and

211
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:32,579
avoid. And then there's a full sleep cycle, which is going from light to moderate to deep,

212
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
and then REM sleep, which is like the super deep, where you get all your brain recovery.

213
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,960
That's a 90-minute nap. And so most of the recommendations around napping is under 30

214
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,539
minutes or a full sleep cycle, which is 90 minutes. And so if you want physical recovery,

215
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,019
it's under 30 minutes. If you want the full physical and cognitive recovery, it's 90 minutes.

216
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,799
And Dr. Golley, for me,

217
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,980
the other type of elite athlete that we should discuss definitely here is the parent and

218
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,460
especially parents with new babies. It is the most important thing. You know,

219
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,519
we talk about sleep. It's almost become a bit of a throwaway term. You know, oh, yeah,

220
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,299
you got to get good sleep. You got to get good exercise. You got to eat well. Everyone means

221
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:18,720
to do it, but people don't give it the amount of attention that it really deserves. And I think

222
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,119
individuals as well as organizations are coming to the party. They're realizing more and more

223
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,779
just how important it is. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really

224
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:27,319
important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And when you throw the curveball

225
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:33,500
of a new mother into the conversation, what people and especially mothers don't appreciate enough

226
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,339
is that when you arrive at the stage of welcoming a newborn, you know, for us dads, it's a hell of

227
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,099
a lot easier. We just get a newborn placed into our arms. But what women have to understand

228
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:53,240
is that they are coming to that point in their life on the back of nine months of pregnancy,

229
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,740
most commonly, which is extremely,

230
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,559
exhausting and depleting physically and emotionally. And in many cases, you're talking

231
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,380
about a conception journey as well for those who go through IVF and other forms of, you know,

232
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,220
if they're having fertility issues. So there is a huge amount of sleep debt and exhaustion that

233
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,339
people come to a newborn with. And then they're dealing with all of these issues, potentially of

234
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:23,000
breastfeeding problems, lack of sleep with an unsettled baby, so many different pieces of the

235
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,640
puzzle. And so, yes, sleep is important, but it's also a lot of work. And so, yes, sleep is

236
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,380
important, but it is a hundred times more important for a new parent, especially a new

237
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,460
mother. I'm going back 21 years, taking home our first born. It was two days after the birth.

238
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,059
You're literally, the system seems to want to get you out of the hospital as quickly as possible,

239
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,400
which I understand at one level. But I remember just that terror of like, what do we do? Like,

240
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,339
no understanding, no education, exhausted, you know, Beck, my beautiful wife, and then,

241
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,099
yes, sleep immediately. First 12 weeks, I remember thinking, this is crazy. And there

242
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,740
isn't that village of support around. Is that something that you see a lot of and

243
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,660
why it's such a tough path these days in the West for young mums in particular?

244
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,980
Yeah, you're a hundred percent right. It's not something I see a lot of. It's all that I see.

245
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,900
You know, we do, we live in a completely different world to where we lived a hundred years ago in

246
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,859
terms of the lack of village and the lack of support. We live in silos. We're all independent.

247
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,400
We've all got our own kitchen. We've all got our own bathroom, our own bedroom,

248
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,660
whereas it used to be much more communal. And so we're doing this by ourselves. But it's even

249
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,160
harder now because there are so many more dual income families. So we've got mums working.

250
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:41,480
We've got mums with careers who are trying to juggle two things. So many times people are

251
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,039
often starting a new business. They're at the depths of their mortgage stress. It all seems

252
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:52,079
to happen at once. And it's almost like a perfect storm. We are seeing an enormous amount of pressure

253
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,519
on young families. And the thing that I see,

254
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,319
most commonly, is that the couple who have prepared for weeks, potentially months on a

255
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:08,440
birth plan, they know all of the options in terms of pain relief, in terms of vaginal birth, Caesar,

256
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:13,279
all of the things, they've got their plan, the way they want things to work, their contingencies.

257
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:19,099
And this is wonderful, but they haven't made a baby plan. As you said, you get home two days

258
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,440
later, three days later, and it's like, okay, what do I do now? I haven't thought about this

259
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,559
part. I haven't planned that. And that is where,

260
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,859
my work begins. That's where I've devoted all of my attention into those first few weeks

261
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,440
so that you can really thrive and not just survive that period.

262
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,460
So Elise, let me ask you, what should we be doing at night? And how do we go about making

263
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,019
sure that we get better sleep, particularly in regard to light exposure?

264
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:52,019
Yeah. And light exposure is the biggest factor that influences our body clocks.

265
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:55,420
And that's why getting light exposure,

266
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,180
a bright light in the mornings, resets our body clock every day. And that's what's really good

267
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:07,420
for us. The other end of the day in the evening, limiting that light exposure, essentially what's

268
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,980
happening is we have evolved to be diurnal, which means day active. We're awake when it's light,

269
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,420
and we're normally asleep when it's dark. And what we did when we invented artificial light

270
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,619
is essentially the sun goes down, we used to go to sleep then, and then we turn on the

271
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:31,180
light switch and we extend our days into the night. And what you're doing there is telling

272
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,539
your body to be awake. You're essentially signaling to the body to still be awake. It's

273
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:43,500
still daytime, it's active time. And that's why switching the light switch off and then going to

274
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,380
bed, your body is saying, I'm still awake. I've been told, I've got the signals that it's daytime.

275
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:55,500
And so it's quite hard to then fall asleep. So I think preparing your body for sleep in that few

276
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,599
hours, that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of

277
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,500
hours before you want to go to sleep and limiting your light exposure as much as you can. There's

278
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,019
some really simple things, you know, do you need to have the overhead lights on? You know, do you

279
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:12,460
need all this glaring light in your house in those evening hours? If not, can you just use a side

280
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:20,539
light? On your phones, most phones now have a function to be able to modify the color of the

281
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:26,279
screen. So on an iPhone, it's called night mode or night shift. And you can actually modify,

282
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:32,720
you can turn it on so that at a certain time in the evening, the color of your screen changes to

283
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,420
more of an orange color and that our eyes are the least sensitive to that kind of light. And so that

284
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,640
can help as well. Shanda, it seems to me that we're surrounded by more and more bright light on

285
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,420
our phones and we're stimulated by our screens more than ever before in human history. Are you seeing

286
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,680
from the research you're doing that that bright light exposure is having a negative effect on

287
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,160
people's sleep patterns? Look, I'm glad you asked about light. Light is a critical time cue for the

288
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,819
circadian system and the circadian process that I referred to earlier. Now, light, we have evolved

289
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:19,640
as organisms to be responding to a natural light-dark cycle before the advent of electricity.

290
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:29,559
And artificial light, we had a light-dark cycle where we had exposure to light from pretty much

291
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:38,380
from sunrise to sunset and then darkness thereafter. Now, we're able to control our own

292
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:46,359
light and dark exposure and electronic devices have compounded this because now we hold a device

293
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,880
very close to our eyes that is emitting light.

294
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,039
And so we're now regulating our own light-dark cycle in a very different way to two or three

295
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:02,500
hundred years ago, what we have been exposed to. We know that the light that is emitted by those

296
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:10,720
devices, the circadian system is responsive to. And how it responds is that it boosts your

297
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:19,779
alertness, your arousal level. It reduces your sleepiness and therefore it disrupts your sleep.

298
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,400
It delays your sleep. And so we're now regulating our own light-dark cycle in a very different way to

299
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
two or three hundred years ago, what we have been exposed to. We know that the light that is emitted by those devices, the circadian system is responsive to. And how it responds is that it boosts your sleep.

300
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,140
It delays the timing of your sleep and it disrupts your sleep.

301
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,299
Now we know that there are big inter-individual differences in the sensitivity to light. Some

302
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:34,839
people are much, much more sensitive to the effects of light than others. So we need to

303
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:41,400
keep that in mind. There is a spectrum of sensitivity. However, in general, as a part

304
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:50,319
of that sleep hygiene I referred to, I would certainly recommend the avoidance of light-emitting devices,

305
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:57,680
electronic devices, close to bedtime and particularly in the hour or so before bedtime.

306
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,359
And Troy, you're the head of high performance at the Milwaukee Bucks, but also have a background

307
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,220
in aerospace engineering, a PhD on that subject. Tell us a bit more about what you're seeing

308
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,079
in the sleep world from that perspective.

309
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,839
Yeah, it's one of the areas where we've done a lot of investigation. So, and if you look

310
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,160
in the space industry, astronauts who are out of space, it's kind of like the same all

311
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
day, right?

312
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,319
So how does an astronaut go to sleep out there? And one of the things they use on the International

313
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,500
Space Station in the past has been blue light filters. That's where all that technology

314
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,079
kind of came from. If you get a big blast of blue light right before you're trying to

315
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,740
go to sleep, your brain actually thinking it's the middle of the day. And so if you

316
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,400
want to delay your bedtime or your natural bedtime, blast it with that blue light. And

317
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,279
so a lot of people these days are filtering out blue light in their bedrooms and the bedside

318
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,160
tables and lamps.

319
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,839
And so they use blue light, and they use blue light on their screens in order to allow that

320
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:59,460
natural process that happens about one to two hours before they go to sleep where it

321
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,380
gets dark, one of the glands in the body starts to produce a hormone called melatonin, and

322
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,160
that starts to reduce your body temperature, which also reduces blood pressure, reduces

323
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,900
cognitive function, and makes you sleepy so that you go to sleep at that right time. And

324
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,319
but blue light is actually something that really interferes with that. And it's something

325
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:25,319
that I always encourage people to start to play with. On the flip side, you know, when

326
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,319
it's cold and wet in Milwaukee, and you want players to come into the training facility

327
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,759
like this, you actually want a lot of blue light. So we actually put a lot of blue light

328
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,700
into our training facility behind us in order to wake the players up and make them feel

329
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,819
alert in the middle of winter.

330
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,700
So if you're wanting to go to sleep, you jump on your phone for half an hour as you're sitting

331
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,240
in bed and you fire off those last six emails that you couldn't wait to not get to. And then

332
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,039
you wonder why it's very hard then to switch off and go to sleep. Is that a problem you think a lot

333
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,759
of people haven't worked out yet? Yeah, I think so. It's definitely,

334
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,460
you can get like little filters that go onto your screen. You can get glasses. There are

335
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,500
technologies that do that. And Mark, tell us about the

336
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,339
understanding of light and the A of 80 perspective of understanding that's relevance to sleep.

337
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll come at it from two angles. One is the more traditional understanding. And that is that

338
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,039
my training, Ayurvedic medicine, which is a six, 7,000 year old sort of tradition of knowledge.

339
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:35,859
It talks about the body going through six, four hour cycles each day when our body's designed to

340
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,180
do different functions. And I like the analogy of a surfer. If you've got a wave on the ocean,

341
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,380
if as a surfer, you can time it. So you catch the wave at its peak. The wave does all the work

342
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,319
for you as a surfer.

343
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:51,920
It's fun. It's enjoyable. You're cutting back, hanging 10. It's like, well, it's fantastic.

344
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,460
If you're getting the wave at the wrong time, like I do when I usually go surfing,

345
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,400
the wave's crashing down on top of your head. And so bad timing equates to stress,

346
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,640
mouthful of water, never going to surf again, not good. And so if we can understand these six,

347
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,019
four hour cycles and understand particularly that at 10 PM till 2 AM is when the body goes

348
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,319
into its natural rejuvenation cycle to deep sleep.

349
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:23,319
To do everything we want a good night's sleep to do. But back ended on that is that the early

350
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:29,420
morning cycle, when the sun's just coming up in the sky is when we're designed to wake. And if we

351
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,299
get that natural light, that particularly sunlight, but even natural light when it's winter, that is

352
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:40,579
what regulates and stimulates the appropriate neurochemistry to send us to sleep at night.

353
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,460
From a modern perspective, the circadian rhythm is similar, but just understanding the different

354
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,319
sort of hormonal patterns.

355
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:53,000
And the cortisols that cycle during the day. And a fascinating study that's just come out in the

356
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,299
last 18 months ago, Stanford University, many of your listeners will know Andrew Huberman,

357
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:05,160
great podcaster. So we need between two and 10 minutes of that natural light early hours of the

358
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,819
day to stimulate the appropriate cortisol response, to increase our focus and attention during the

359
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:17,039
day. It starts the melatonin response that we need. And it also syncs our circadian rhythm so

360
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,319
that by the end of the day, we're going to be able to sleep at night.

361
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:23,420
By the end of the day, we actually can go into our natural sleep cycle. So circadian rhythm is just

362
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:29,480
like that wave on the ocean. There's an inbuilt timer, if you like. And if we can sync our body

363
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,460
clock with that timer, then not only sleep, but proper digestion of food, proper elimination of

364
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,119
wastes, the whole thing just comes into sync and balance.

365
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,579
Well, for mine, we have just started to scratch the surface of sleep health, better sleep,

366
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,099
and what it means to live.
