1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:05,849
There is nothing more necessary to a human than sleep.

2
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:07,030
That's it.

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:13,330
If we live to the age of 90, we will spend about 30 years asleep.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,890
Way back many thousands of years ago in my studies,

5
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,570
sleep being one of the three pillars of health and well-being.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,969
Sleep is the most underutilized natural performance enhancer that we have.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,289
It's just as important as daily exercise.

8
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,149
Hello and welcome to another special episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,890
Over the past year, we've featured conversations

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,310
with a diverse range of incredibly talented creatives,

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,490
academics, athletes, philanthropists, and business leaders.

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,609
And as always, some common threads have appeared.

13
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,210
One of which is the idea that great sleep is maybe more important

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,149
than we ever realized for a successful life.

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,869
Many of these guests we've had on the podcast are members of our leader community

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,350
and we are constantly inspired by the work we do working alongside these people

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,130
in our city.

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,670
This is our signature Elita Connect program,

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,549
where we bring together groups of five to six people from diverse backgrounds

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,629
to come together to learn, to connect, and to share.

21
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,890
And we would love to collaborate with you.

22
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,349
So if you're interested in joining our leader community,

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,030
have a look at our website, head to elitacollective.com,

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,170
book a discovery call today.

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,730
We would love to chat to you.

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,629
There is a brilliant study that I've had a look at recently

27
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,909
of Division One Stanford basketball players

28
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,930
who by simply adding two hours sleep a night

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,930
saw tangible improvements in sleep.

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,609
Free throw, three point percentage, reaction time, VO2 max,

31
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,390
and general mood among other markers.

32
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,469
Same study has been repeated in tennis players and swimmers

33
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,829
with similar results.

34
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,870
And it's now been shown that even just 45 minutes extra sleep per night

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,049
for just three days can have a significant impact

36
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:53,209
on an athlete's performance, including a 20% reduction in cortisol

37
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,670
and losses of body fat.

38
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,290
If it can have that big an effect on elite athletes,

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,030
imagine what it can do for you.

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,010
And your life.

41
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,390
And with amazing data like that out there

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,290
and that common clue that sleep leads to success,

43
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,229
I wanted to dive in more.

44
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,830
So we assembled a panel of world-leading experts

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,949
who have genuinely helped me understand

46
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,750
that probably the greatest opportunity to improve your life

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,689
is through improving your sleep.

48
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,090
In our first sleep episode last week,

49
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,030
The Sharpest Minds in Sleep highlighted

50
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,250
how important sleep is to your personal wellbeing,

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,310
your career, and what a huge predictor of success

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,550
it is in any given field.

53
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,030
In this episode,

54
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,789
we focus on the practical advice we all need

55
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,509
to help us create the best sleep habits

56
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,129
that we possibly can.

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,009
We'll cover light exposure,

58
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,789
body and bed temperature,

59
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,990
hygiene practices,

60
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,830
schedules and consistency,

61
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,210
stress prevention,

62
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,409
and some advice for parents and expecting parents,

63
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,629
perhaps the most sleep-deprived people of all.

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,509
Our experts over these two specials are

65
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,629

for sleep disorders,

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,409
caused by biological clock disruption,

83
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,669
a global expert in every sense.

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,430

93
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,830
Big thanks to Jason Nicholas

94

and his team at Tempered Bedding.

95
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,110
This sleep special is proudly brought to you

96
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,870
by Tempered mattresses,

97
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,830
adjustable bases and pillows.

98
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,610
The difference is temper.

99
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,069
The conversations I had with this panel

100
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,409
have fundamentally changed the way I think about sleep.

101
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,590
And I'm hoping that by listening in,

102
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,530
you'll also gain a lot of insight

103
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,590
into how you can optimize your own sleep

104
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,930
in order to live the best life you can.

105
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,730
The final part of our panel's discussion

106
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,730
is here for you today.

107
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,370
And I began by asking Dr. Elise Faceford Childs,

108
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,110
who specialize in taking people from good sleep

109
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,350
to high-performing sleep,

110
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,689
what are some of the things we can all do to optimize sleep?

111
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,310
To optimize our sleep in a more powerful way.

112
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,410
I mean, a lot of people,

113
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,930
like looking at basic sleep habits and behaviors

114
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,930
kind of at the simple level.

115
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,689
And this is things that people are probably all aware of,

116
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,069
you know, managing,

117
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,850
making sure that you're getting enough sleep opportunity.

118
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,310
So the time that you're actually in bed,

119
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,689
for some people, you know,

120
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,149
I'll say I went to bed at 10 and I got up at six.

121
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,149
So I slept eight hours, but that's not quite true.

122
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,889
That's how long you were in bed.

123
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,529
So you're already in bed.

124
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,870
You're already shortening the time

125
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,889
that you're probably spending asleep.

126
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,290
So making sure that you have enough sleep opportunity,

127
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,310
and that should be based on how much sleep your body needs.

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,870
And that varies between individuals.

129
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,769
So that's, what's really important.

130
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,069
And where the generalization I think comes from

131
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,449
is some people like, oh, I need to sleep eight hours.

132
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,189
And then when they don't, that can start,

133
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,829
you know, having an impact.

134
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,769
Some people and athletes,

135
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,949
we see tend to need a bit more sleep.

136
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,029
Some people need a bit more sleep than the general population,

137
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,829
maybe just because of the mental and physical load

138
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,490
that they're going through.

139
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,870
Other things in terms of your maintaining kind of good habits

140
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,870
and behaviors around your sleep environment,

141
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,029
the temperature, things like light exposure

142
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,029
is a huge factor that I think is not talked about enough yet.

143
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,029
So managing your light exposure in the morning

144
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,529
compared to limiting it in the evening.

145
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,870
Lots of little things like that,

146
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,870
but it can be significant in isolation.

147
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,709
If you add all of those together,

148
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:06,449
you can often see this improvement in sleep.

149
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,829
For the average person listening

150
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,529
that wants to have better sleep,

151
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,750
what are some key things they should look at

152
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,209
to achieve better sleep?

153
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,410
One of the things that's recently come out

154
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,569
in the research that is quite interesting

155
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,629
and getting a lot of attention at the moment

156
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,949
is your consistency in your sleep.

157
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,870
So that is going to bed and waking up at a similar time

158
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,370
and keeping regular with you,

159
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,410
with that day to day.

160
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,370
That's something that lots of people we chop and change

161
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,610
because of our social schedules, you know,

162
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,990
and at the weekend we have social activities that we go out

163
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,170
and then our sleep timings change

164
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,329
and then maybe we sleep in.

165
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,290
But sleep regularity or sleep consistency

166
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,329
has started emerging as a really important factor

167
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,709
that is linked to health and performance outcomes.

168
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,170
If that was just one thing that I would say is trying to keep,

169
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,410
a regular sleep schedule, maybe not to the minute,

170
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,250
you know, we're doing some research around

171
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,790
what's the optimal window that you can vary

172
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,589
with your sleep regularity,

173
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:12,370
but trying to keep as consistent as you can

174
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,550
and not chopping and changing between the days.

175
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,509
That would be, that would be my number one.

176
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,009
Dr. Troy Flanagan, we often say you spend a third

177
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,370
of your life asleep if you add it all up.

178
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,790
So I wanna ask you about how important the right bedding is

179
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,470
given you've worked extensively with Olympic athletes.

180
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,129
And this year we saw a number of athletes,

181
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,509
a number of Olympians in Paris,

182
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,430
literally turning up with their own beds

183
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,829
to make sure they could get the best night's sleep possible

184
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,329
and replicate their home set up.

185
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,970
So how important to you is having the right bedding?

186
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,790
I think it's really important for,

187
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,589
you know, firstly for comfort and also for hygiene.

188
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,250
It's one of the things that, you know,

189
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,430
sleep is also related to your immune system.

190
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,790
So making sure that you get the right amount of sleep,

191
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,329
but also you're sleeping in a hygienic environment.

192
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,750
It's the one thing that we have to continually remind

193
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,089
young athletes.

194
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,829
This is, you know, have a very strict routine

195
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,889
on changing over bed sheeting and things like that

196
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,329
so that they stay in a hygienic environment.

197
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,750
Another intervention that we're doing at the moment,

198
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,670
particularly to enhance deep sleep and REM sleep

199
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,009
is to cool the bedding.

200
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,470
And so there's some really smart beds these days

201
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,209
that I actually have this on my bed at home.

202
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:27,430
And what it will do, it will start to learn about your sleep

203
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,230
and it measures sleep as you go,

204
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,009
and it manipulates the temperature of your bed.

205
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:34,090
So we know that when you go into deep sleep,

206
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,889
your body temperature drops.

207
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,429
And so it starts to cool you and to get you into that deep sleep.

208
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,129
And it will manipulate and start to play with the up and down.

209
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,509
Oh, he's going to deeper sleep that work.

210
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,889
And the smart bed actually starts to enhance

211
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,809
the amount of deep sleep you get and REM sleep that you get.

212
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,190
And so there's so much technology coming out in this area.

213
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,029
The bedding and it's really exciting and quite interesting

214
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,730
to start to look at and see how your bed's getting smarter

215
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,690
and affecting you over time.

216
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,690
Exposure to sunlight during the day

217
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,649
is another one that is really important.

218
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,190
I think exercise in the morning or early afternoon

219
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,950
is really good.

220
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,429
I wouldn't exercise too close to bedtime

221
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,610
just because of the processes, the waking up processes

222
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,889
that happen with exercise.

223
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,070
But I think it's really important.

224
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,110
I think there's lots of interventions to stay up

225
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,110
with what the latest is.

226
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,909
But really try and think like a physiologist

227
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,649
in how we plan and periodize training.

228
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,309
You should be planning and periodizing your sleep.

229
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,950
So even things like caffeine, Troy,

230
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,029
understanding when the last time that you have that before sleep

231
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,870
are all those factors you said diet, exercise, sleep, sunlight.

232
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,570
It's the whole gamut.

233
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,269
Yeah, I think caffeine is definitely a stimulant.

234
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,909
If you habituate it, it's less of a stimulant.

235
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:59,789
But I think having strict rules around caffeine.

236
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,750
And caffeine does actually take 48 hours

237
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,529
to clear out of the body when you have a cup of coffee.

238
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:11,149
The half-life of caffeine is two days before it's completely zero.

239
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,149
And so don't think that, oh, I had one at 3 o'clock.

240
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,210
All the caffeine's gone.

241
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,149
It's still there.

242
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,789
So if you're getting into deficit,

243
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,669
maybe that's when you go off caffeine for a couple of days

244
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:26,710
until you catch up and then go back on it.

245
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,210
But golly, for parents, and in particular expecting parents out there,

246
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,210
can you give us a snapshot of what a healthy plan looks like

247
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,289
when you bring a newborn baby home

248
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,710
and you're wanting to get the best sleep possible?

249
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,990
What are some tips that you can give us?

250
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,909
For me, the number one thing is prevention.

251
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,570
So prevent stress.

252
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,450
And one example of that is know what is to be expected.

253
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,250
One of many examples is knowing what a newborn rash is,

254
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,029
knowing that all babies get these little red dots

255
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,289
all over their bodies in the first few days of life,

256
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,049
and it's completely harmless.

257
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,590
But if you've never heard of or read about

258
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,710
or seen a photo of a newborn rash,

259
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,629
you could automatically think that your child's got

260
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:08,250
some sort of bacterial infection, and then you panic,

261
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,590
and then you lose hours of sleep.

262
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,669
And you lose the ability to enjoy that period

263
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,210
because a three-day-old,

264
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,490
you should just be wanting to eat them.

265
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,330
They're just so gorgeous and adorable and angelic,

266
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,629
and you don't need to be spending your time and energy

267
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:25,669
worrying about things that are completely normal.

268
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,909
So that's the first thing is being prepared,

269
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,090
knowing what's normal,

270
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,129
and knowing when you need to call for help.

271
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,830
And I think also in terms of setting up for success,

272
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,289
it's all about trying to get into a good rhythm.

273
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:40,009
I don't talk about sleep routines under six weeks of age.

274
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,509
I talk about a good rhythm,

275
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,009
and that is something you can achieve

276
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,129
in the first few days and weeks of life,

277
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,549
which is discrete feeding time,

278
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,129
discrete sleeping time,

279
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:53,330
and then other, which is play, bath, changing, et cetera.

280
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,509
And I see a lot of moms, dads, and dads, and they say,

281
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,809
okay, now you've come up with a pretty good routine,

282
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,090
and they call it a day.

283
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,309
It's where you have to be prepared

284
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,590
to get there sooner rather than later.

285
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,970
That's the basic thing,

286
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,450
and I think that if there are any concerns

287
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,809
aboutuvoirts fighters or dads, or couples,

288
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,409
getting into problems where they are cluster feeding

289
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:13,950
their snack feeding,

290
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,789
and there's often a very simple reason

291
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,289
as to why that's happening,

292
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,409
and they're in a bit of a snack cycle,

293
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,090
it's not a difficult thing to break.

294
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,830
And, as I said, that's where I put all of my attention,

295
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:31,110
six weeks, five kilograms sleeping through the night. So if you can get through that period

296
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,110
with sleep deprivation and all the stress just for six weeks, you can then, you know, there's

297
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,789
a light at the end of the tunnel. There are lots of people I see who come to me in my rooms

298
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:47,549
four months, even four years later, and they've just said, well, I haven't slept since my child

299
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:53,350
was born. And that kind of thing, I just, I hate when people write off that period. It doesn't

300
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,009
need to be like that. You can sleep, you can expect to sleep. And there is always a reason,

301
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,970
and there's always something we can do to help that baby and then help the parents and all

302
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,370
members of the household. Mark Barn, you've written books and are a world-leading expert

303
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,289
on Ayurveda. It's a whole body system of medicine that began in India thousands of years ago.

304
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,990
What are some of the traditional methods of improving sleep quality that you bring forward

305
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,009
from Ayurveda? What are some of the traditional methods of improving sleep that we can learn

306
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:23,330
from this?

307
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,970
From an Ayurvedic perspective, we always ask the question, what's causing the lack of sleep? So

308
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,409
there's not one size fits all, but there's a number of really key and common sort of

309
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:39,529
considerations with most people today. One is the understanding that lack of sleep generally

310
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:47,490
is due to an overexcitation of the nervous system. And it's an accumulated effect of many things.

311
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,049
It can be, you know, caffeine, obviously, stress at work. And one of the big things that's coming

312
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:59,909
out in the last five, 10 years is a disconnection from our natural cycles or natural rhythm. So

313
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:04,269
when I speak about people getting better sleep, I actually try and rephrase it,

314
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:10,549
that we have to get back in tune with what's called circadian health. All the great traditions

315
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,649
of knowledge, the long-living cultures have understood that, you know, the cycle of the sun,

316
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,789
particularly, which emits a certain frequency of light through the eyes and stimulates the

317
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,649
pineal gland that then stimulates our neurotransmitters.

318
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:28,570
And the melatonins that we all hear about is absolutely fundamental to good sleep. So getting

319
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,470
in tune with a circadian rhythm, you know, waking up at the right times, getting early morning

320
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,490
sunlight. So it sort of sequences our neurotransmitters so that we can fall asleep

321
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:45,129
effectively at night. And then this sort of second sort of understanding of just reducing that

322
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:51,009
often excessive mental stimulation, what's sort of aggravating the nervous system. So when it's

323
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,009
time to sleep, the mind's not sort of racing at 100%.

324
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,710
Miles an hour and we toss and turn and can't get a good night.

325
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,529
So Bunny, if someone's listening to this, they are struggling with sleep. I know it's not one

326
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,490
size fits all, but could you give maybe two or three or four things that would make sense to

327
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,909
help someone achieve better sleep? Yeah. So basically start first minute

328
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:18,049
of the day. We can go through a daily clock if you like. So if they're not getting outside in

329
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:23,029
the early hours of the day, and that's within usually 30 to 60 minutes of sunrise, they

330
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:29,629
want to readjust their bedtime. And a lot of research now on good sleep is getting to bed

331
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,889
and waking up at roughly the same time a day, because that's what resets that circadian rhythm.

332
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:40,289
So getting outside, most of us today live in artificially lit homes. Many people go to

333
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:45,429
workplaces that are artificially lit, and then they come home at the end of the day, artificially lit

334
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:50,549
homes. So we're what's called mal-illuminated. We need that natural light, particularly sunlight,

335
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,029
if it's out. So 5, 10, 15,

336
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:58,149
minutes, early morning, outside, walk the dog, do some stretching, whatever it is, make some phone

337
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:03,970
calls, be productive, all good. But that's really going to set up the whole hormonal sequence for

338
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,350
the day. At the end of a workday, which is often when we get that overexcitation, we need to sort

339
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,870
of switch off from the day. One thing I'd really recommend is some form of earthing or grounding.

340
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,389
Again, many of your listeners will be familiar with this term, but we now know that connecting

341
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,029
to nature,

342
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:28,350
particularly directly, so taking the shoes and socks off at the end of the day and just

343
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,370
walking down the beach, if you're near a body of water or the ocean, even at home, just sitting

344
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,909
outside having your glass of red wine or your de-stressed beer at the end of the day, having

345
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:46,889
lunch in a park, anything we can do to connect to the earth itself. We know douses the inflammatory

346
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:53,029
fires that line our tissues, but it also profoundly earths the body. When we think of not being our

347
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,730
sleep, we often use terms like, I'm spacey, I feel airy, and I'm away with the fairies.

348
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:05,769
What's the exact operatives of space and air? It's earth or ground. So looking to that,

349
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,630
there's even indoor earthing products now that people can buy where they have bed sheets or

350
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,970
earthing pillowcases where you're basically earthed, even when you're indoors. And a lot

351
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:22,289
of people find them really helpful for insomnia. And then probably the last one would be around

352
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:31,009
6 p.m. is when the ancient understanding is that we transition from the day cycle to the night

353
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:37,410
cycle. And that's when the body's really trying to slow down in readiness to deep sleep. So

354
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,190
anything we can do to reduce the overstimulation of that time is really, really helpful. We've

355
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,950
all heard about blue light from our laptops and our iPhones. So where we can is trying to jump

356
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,829
on a desktop at night if we have to do some work.

357
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,430
Because it gives us a bit more distance. Screen protectors, blue light filtering glasses,

358
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:04,930
all those things, even looking into dimming the lights in people's homes, or even looking at what

359
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,130
they now call circadian lighting or smart lighting, where you can actually get different color hues

360
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,509
that come on in the evening to actually reduce that blue light exposure and promote good sleep.

361
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:22,450
And probably the final one is just using aromatherapy in the bedroom. I'm really

362
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:28,490
trying to be practical when I talk about sleep. People are so busy that I don't often have time

363
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,430
to do foot massages and meditate for an hour and all that sort of stuff. But getting a really good

364
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,470
quality diffuser, put it in the bedroom at seven o'clock at night, you go and put some really

365
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,349
relaxing, calming essential oils. And then once you're in the bedroom, you get seven or eight

366
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:51,750
hours of benefit of this powerful effects of aromatherapy, reducing that mental stimulation

367
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,930
and just relaxation.

368
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,450
And obviously in the lounge room as well at night, if the other people in your house are okay with

369
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,769
the smells you're putting out there, but that'd be a few key ones I think can really help.

370
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:06,910
And finally, Shanta, you're one of the world's leading experts and researchers in sleep. Over

371
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,230
many decades, you've been on research panels around the globe. For people listening, can you

372
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,369
share a few tips that are maybe universal to achieving better sleep? And what would you

373
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,950
suggest to people they can do right now to help them sleep better?

374
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,109
So Luke, I would refer to three...

375
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:29,670
We now refer to three dimensions of sleep health to maintain optimal health and performance.

376
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,849
The first is duration. That's what we were talking about first. Everyone's aware that

377
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:43,269
you need to get a good, adequate amount of sleep to be able to recover, to be able to,

378
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:50,150
for sleep to play those critical functions that they play. So the best way to know how

379
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,869
much sleep you need is the extent to which you sleep.

380
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:52,950
Okay.

381
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,950
The extent to which you're relying on stimulants and other things to keep you awake during

382
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,250
the day. The extent to which you're falling asleep involuntarily. The extent to which

383
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,349
you're relying on an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. How much do you oversleep

384
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:10,549
when you take away the alarm clock? All of those are indicators of, are you getting an

385
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,509
adequate amount of sleep? So the majority of the population would need somewhere between

386
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:22,789
seven and nine. And certainly the epidemiological evidence, the evidence at a population level,

387
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:30,269
suggests that less than six is associated with adverse effects on your health, your

388
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:39,029
mortality, risk of various medical conditions. It's usually the less than six and the shorter

389
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:45,630
sleep that is associated with the risk of those conditions.

390
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:51,789
So the first is duration. The second we were talking about is timing and regularity of

391
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:52,789
your sleep.

392
00:20:52,789 --> 00:21:00,950
So what we're talking about here is trying to optimize the time that you go to sleep

393
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:08,329
so that it is as close as possible to your circadian drive for sleep, your circadian

394
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:16,750
timing, and also keeping it regular. We now know that the circadian clock is programmed

395
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,630
to be able to do something that is predictable, is synchronized to the external environment,

396
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:30,009
that you're in. And shifting it around every day gives you kind of like this permanent

397
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:37,990
state of jet lag. And so regularity and timing are a critical dimension as well.

398
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,069
The third one is quality of sleep. So if you can get the duration right, you can get the

399
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:49,430
regularity and timing right, can you get the quality, an optimal quality of sleep? And

400
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,789
there are several things that affect the quality of sleep.

401
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:58,349
The first is that many people have sleep disorders that they're unaware of. There

402
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:04,750
are over 90 types of sleep disorders, and many remain undiagnosed because there is an

403
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,869
inadequate awareness of them.

404
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:12,670
So the first is to look out for the symptoms of sleep disorders. The Sleep Health Foundation

405
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:19,269
has several fact sheets that help the public to understand what are the common symptoms

406
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,789
of sleep disorders.

407
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,190
So sleep disorders really compromise your quality of sleep.

408
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,430
The second thing is your own behavior and the environment you sleep in can also compromise

409
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:37,390
the quality of your sleep. If you have had meals too late in the day, caffeine late in

410
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,990
the day, alcohol disrupts the quality of your sleep, the temperature in which you're sleeping,

411
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,710
the bedroom environment, all of these factors, you know, collectively are referred to as

412
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,789
sleep hygiene.

413
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:50,789
Okay.

414
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,230
What can impact your quality of sleep?

415
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,990
So paying attention to all of these factors, some of them are internally driven, biologically

416
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,910
driven like sleep disorders.

417
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,829
Some of these are environmentally driven and behaviorally driven, but they all impact upon

418
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:07,329
your quality of sleep.

419
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:13,470
So my message to your listeners, focus on duration, focus on regularity and focus on

420
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,470
quality of sleep.

421
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,190
