1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:12,089
How do you start a new leadership journey when the way you've been taught is embedded

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,009
in everything you do?

3
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,410
And how does this affect the way you bond with your team or your colleagues?

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,769
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

5
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,530
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,410
passion of mine.

7
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,449
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and have had the privilege

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,990
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts that have helped

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,670
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,229
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,269
I sat down with Australian fast bowler and vice captain Pat Cummins to discuss the young

12
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,469
leaders he works with to improve their leadership, finding balance in your life when you're constantly

13
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:13,209
touring and how he thinks about career longevity.

14
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:21,010
Well, our guest today grew up in beautiful Mount Riverview at the base of the Blue Mountains

15
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,989
in New South Wales, an incredible part of the world.

16
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:23,969
He's 28 years of age.

17
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:28,590
He's the vice captain of the Australian cricket team in all formats and currently the ICC number

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,010
one ranked test bowler in the world.

19
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,469
It's an extraordinary achievement in the world of sport.

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,049
He joins us on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

21
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,250
Pat, thanks for your time today.

22
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,810
No worries.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,370
G'day, Darcy.

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:37,730
How are you going?

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,650
I'm well, mate.

26
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,989
I've been looking forward to catching up with you and excited to chat to you about all things

27
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:43,629
leadership.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,569
Can I start by asking, was leadership something that you always had aspirations to be?

29
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,170
No, never really aspirations to be captain.

30
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,170
I think I've always loved...

31
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,989
Sport and being part of a team, trying to achieve a common goal.

32
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:04,349
And I think now in my, I guess, professional career, I think it's my 11th or 12th season

33
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,109
playing for Australia.

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,650
So with that and with age, I think it comes a bit more responsibility.

35
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,949
So yeah, naturally assume a bit more of a role.

36
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:13,969
Well, maybe it's interesting.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,270
I was actually looking up ahead of this chat around why hasn't there been a fast bowler's

38
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,129
captain of Australia?

39
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,449
I think there's this...

40
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,129
My statsman told me that Ray Linwell back in 1952...

41
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,090
1956 filled in for a short period of time.

42
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,710
But why can't fast bowlers be captain of the Australian cricket team?

43
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,129
I don't know.

44
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,669
I mean, we're always the smartest ones.

45
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,270
So I don't know.

46
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,969
That's certainly not a reason why.

47
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,849
It's just one of those things.

48
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,490
It's, I guess, you know, the reasons most commonly, I guess, said are, you know, batters

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,189
aren't injured as much.

50
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,789
They've got more time in the field.

51
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,330
A lot of them say they're, you know, they're smarter.

52
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,430
They think about the game more deeply than bowlers.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,009
They're probably the most common.

54
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,229
I've played with a lot of batters who weren't very smart.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,930
And I've played a lot of bowlers who weren't very smart or, you know, vice versa, really

56
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,590
smart guys.

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,169
And you don't play professional sport unless you know the game really, really well.

58
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,449
So, yeah, I don't think there's any reason why a fast bowler can't be.

59
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,490
I think it brings with it some more challenges, you know, probably physical when you're out

60
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,030
there on the field.

61
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,830
But, you know, lots of different opportunities as well as a fast bowler.

62
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:24,110
In my old sport, the world of AFL, Ruckman Coppert as well.

63
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,389
But we are the smartest bracket in our game as well.

64
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,710
So, no, the big men are much unfairly maligned.

65
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:30,490
I'm with you.

66
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,430
The smartest people are fast bowlers and big men from the world of footy.

67
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,409
Coach Justin Lay will be lucky enough to speak on this podcast as well.

68
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:42,110
And when he talks about leadership, it's all self-improvement and collaboration.

69
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,490
And his respect for your leadership is through the roof.

70
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,169
Can I ask you, what sort of influence has the coach had on you?

71
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,090
He's been great.

72
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,909
Yeah, I came into the role as vice captain since he's been coach.

73
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,050
And exactly as you said, self-improvement, you know, he's a big reader.

74
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:03,310
So, he's always got books he's suggesting and handing out, trying to find different ways

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,849
to do, you know, different things.

76
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,949
So, I've really enjoyed, well, you know, hearing his experience.

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,870
He's been a coach for quite a long time now.

78
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,569
Obviously, he played at the highest level, works, you know, with West Coast Eagles as

79
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,909
well, a few other different sports.

80
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,589
So, I've learned a lot from him.

81
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:23,290
And I think just being closer to someone in a high-pressure role who has quite a lot of

82
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,769
responsibility.

83
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,930
I just probably never fully appreciated, you know, that role until, yeah, you become

84
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,410
a senior player, I guess, and are a bit more involved.

85
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:36,410
The dynamics of cricket fascinate me, Pat.

86
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,290
You work in pretty small teams when you think about 11 take the field and travelling parties

87
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,810
comparatively are pretty small.

88
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,290
You spend a lot of time together, hotel rooms and on planes travelling around the globe.

89
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,910
It comes with it, I suppose, some interesting challenges.

90
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,910
How do you go about trying to...

91
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,430
How do you get the best out of teammates around you in what is a pretty unique environment?

92
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,050
Oh, it is.

93
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,850
And, you know, I've chatted to a few other, you know, guys from different sports and the

94
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,649
common thread that, yeah, we've had to adjust to in cricket is it's not just a tour.

95
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,170
It's really our life.

96
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,350
You know, we spend more time on the road than at home.

97
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:15,050
So, trying to find...

98
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,730
If you're doing things that aren't, I guess, sustainable, you know, if you're pushing someone

99
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,350
too hard, if you're asking too much for, you know, too many hours of them or anything,

100
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,790
you're going to be found out eventually.

101
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,329
So, yeah, trying to find that balance to what makes everyone tick, create an environment

102
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,050
where even on a cricket tour, we get totally away from cricket.

103
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,430
And a lot of the guys raise their children for the first, you know, five, six, seven

104
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,149
years of the children's lives in hotel rooms.

105
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,990
So, trying to strike that balance is probably the biggest challenge.

106
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,930
And the personality is not unique to cricket.

107
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,930
Like every environment, there's different types of characters.

108
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,930
But I suppose that gets magnified.

109
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,189
Or here in Australia, the other codes having to hub together and their families travel

110
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,569
together.

111
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,329
And, you know, some of the stories are positive, some of them not so positive, Pat, around

112
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,290
suddenly you're dealing with, you know, other people's families as well.

113
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,230
That's something you guys have to do.

114
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,269
What sort of mechanisms do you put in place?

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,490
Do you need time apart?

116
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,730
Do you just bond more?

117
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,290
Or are there groups of guys that...

118
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,769
Does it form more cliques in cricket?

119
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,529
Is there any explanation for that?

120
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,110
Oh, there's definitely cliques within, you know, any team.

121
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,110
But, I mean, we spend, you know...

122
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,730
The fast bowler...

123
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,949
Bowlers, we're tight, not only because we're the same age and from the same state, but

124
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,730
for most of the year, we're living basically together.

125
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,769
And every night, you're in the physio room together eating dinner.

126
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,829
So, there's different cliques that form.

127
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,370
But, yeah, I think everyone manages differently.

128
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,129
Some players love having their partners there all the time.

129
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:44,509
Others like, you know, partners and family coming in for a couple of weeks and then maybe

130
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,389
having a couple of weeks just to concentrate on cricket.

131
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,829
But I think the big thing is we're open to everything.

132
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:53,389
You've everyone...

133
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,230
Need something different, then we can try and cater to that to make sure, you know,

134
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,970
not only that they perform well, but they're happy.

135
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,790
And, Pat, we got connected in recent times through the passion for work we've been doing

136
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,930
with a business called Alita and one of my oldest friends, Matt Waterwitz.

137
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,970
And you've been part of a really interesting collaboration I was keen to talk to you about

138
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,329
if you're open to.

139
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,709
But, you know, you formed a group that reflect together and catch up.

140
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,990
And it's a really fascinating group for me.

141
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,329
Marcus Bondapeli is the...

142
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,649
25-year-old superstar AFL player, captain of the Bulldogs and one of the great players

143
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,050
in the game and a young captain, Andy Lee, who's one of the most successful entertainers.

144
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,790
And I know an old friend of yours, Hamish and Andy Fame, and just an extraordinary person

145
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,269
and leader in his own right.

146
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,850
And Rob Sitch is a slightly different generation, Rob.

147
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,269
But what he's achieved with the Working Dog team and some of the greatest entertainment

148
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,709
pieces ever produced have come out of Working Dog.

149
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,009
And Rob's just a fascinating guy.

150
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:52,850
Can you tell us about your...

151
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,930
Your interest in that and what that group's done for you?

152
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:56,889
I've loved it.

153
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,910
Yeah, we've caught up every fortnight for the last few months.

154
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,829
I didn't know Marcus or Rob beforehand.

155
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,069
You know, I know Andy, you know, quite well for quite a few years.

156
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,389
But I love hearing, you know, shared experiences with someone like Marcus, who's in the middle

157
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:12,050
of his career.

158
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,689
He's leading a, you know, a whole side and a club, which is quite different to, you know,

159
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,110
cricket in a lot of ways.

160
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,949
And of course, Rob and Andy, total different industries.

161
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,149
Going into it, I thought them as more, I guess, creative, laid back types.

162
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,350
And then you quickly realise there's a method behind, you know, the longevity and the success

163
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:43,549
and, yeah, so many different, I guess, problems or challenges that come up, you know, no matter

164
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,809
the industry, they're the same kind of problems and challenges and, yeah, speak to those two

165
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,289
experienced guys, especially how they've overcome them and how they see, you know, what they

166
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:53,710
see is important.

167
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,529
Things that get them rolled up, which they've learned over time, aren't that important.

168
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,809
I've just really enjoyed, yeah, a lot of shared experiences with those guys.

169
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,250
And Pat, we've sort of got this passion, Matt and I were the leader around, you know, connecting

170
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,850
groups of people because, you know, traditionally you do, you know, work in silos and someone

171
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,590
like you travelling the world, you've got an incredibly busy schedule and the idea that

172
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,809
you, you know, take time out and, you know, it might necessarily look like a direct fit

173
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,129
perhaps with another sporting captain.

174
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,649
Like the Bond, but, you know, I suppose if you found that there's things that you've

175
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,490
applied directly into your daily life, has there been examples where you're like, oh,

176
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,149
that's something that I can really take away and it helps me on a day-to-day basis?

177
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,590
Yeah, I think, I hope, I'm sure he won't mind me mentioning this, but Andy, when we

178
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,970
first said, okay, we're going to do this, I asked him and he's like, yeah, I'll come

179
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,230
on.

180
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,190
I think he was just trying to help me out really and he, yeah, Matt sent through, oh,

181
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,690
we're going to do eight classes or eight, sorry, lessons.

182
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,370
We're going to do eight lessons together and Andy said, oh, I'll see how I go after

183
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,929
the first two.

184
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,870
I'm pretty busy after that, which was kind of, he leaving the door open so he could exit

185
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,549
and then he, a couple of weeks ago, he's like, geez, I'm so sorry I said that.

186
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:07,929
I want more.

187
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,289
So, it's, yeah, there's been lots of things.

188
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:19,149
I guess, you know, different almost like hacks that people do to Rob or Andy or Mark as a

189
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,909
founder to get the best out of, I guess, co-workers.

190
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,090
Yeah.

191
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,690
Around managing.

192
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,389
Around managing time and expectations and, you know, one for me is how to, you know,

193
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,750
busy people create their own space and time to make sure they stay creative and engaged

194
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,730
and think of new ideas and so there's heaps of things I'm butchering in a bit but I've

195
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,129
got a notepad full of about a hundred of them that I, yeah, I go back to.

196
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,110
Yeah, and I understand that you're an incredible contributor and clearly there's a, you know,

197
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,029
private conversation.

198
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:59,529
And a lot of that is not for air but, you know, Matt has told me, you know, who's facilitating

199
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,409
it on behalf of a leader.

200
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,289
What a great contributor you are that you're an avid reader yourself.

201
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,129
Can I ask what sort of books are you into?

202
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,490
I understand you read a lot about leadership.

203
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,110
What sort of books can you share with us?

204
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,710
Basically anything really.

205
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,750
I chop and change, you know, depending on my mood.

206
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:21,350
I guess, to be honest, a lot of the time it's just what I'm doing at that stage.

207
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,009
So, for example, if I'm on tour.

208
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:28,470
And I'm all cricket, I'll try and normally get non-fiction in a total different subject

209
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,669
and I find getting away from cricket and, you know, learning something new, that kind

210
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:34,490
of energises me.

211
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,830
And then there's other times where I'm, I don't know, flat out, things are going on

212
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,210
and I'll read a novel or something where it's, you know, a bit of an escapism of something

213
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,370
totally different.

214
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,409
But anything, at the moment I'm reading a Bill Bryson book.

215
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,049
It's One Summer in 1927, I think it's called.

216
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:52,909
It's, yeah.

217
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,009
Quite a fun read about America in 1927.

218
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,509
But, yeah, leadership, you know, science, quite like that, you know, self-improvement,

219
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,009
psychology, all those types of books I find quite good.

220
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,350
I'm going to put it on you then, Pat.

221
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,049
If you could recommend one book and you want to share that with a whole group of people,

222
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,769
what's the one you're going to give to all your mates?

223
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,090
The one I've probably given away the most, it's a little bit different.

224
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,450
It's called Awareness by Anthony DeMello.

225
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,730
And he was a, I think he was a Jesuit priest or something.

226
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,070
But he was based in India and he, you know, puts a lot of, yeah, I guess, ownership of

227
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,470
yourself.

228
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,629
The awareness is around trying to know where your prejudices are and your things that affect

229
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,110
you that you might not perhaps think about.

230
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,690
And, yeah, I find reading that just gives me good clarity on, I guess, how I think and

231
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,669
things that, yeah, you get right up about never seem as bad as they are.

232
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,110
Awareness by Anthony DeMello.

233
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:48,750
Writing that down.

234
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:50,250
We'll put that in the notes.

235
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,629
But I hope you won't mind.

236
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,889
But Matt was telling me of a hack recently that I hope you don't mind us sharing around

237
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:01,710
you talking about decision-making in recent times and perhaps it leads to trusting your

238
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,250
gut instinct.

239
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,710
In your mind, it's that you either have that moment where someone asks you to do something

240
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,409
and it's, hell yes, I want to do it or hell no.

241
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,110
Is that something you use in your decision-making?

242
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,149
Yeah, it is.

243
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,990
You know, really lucky in the last few years, so many different opportunities come forward

244
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,250
and I'm a lot of them.

245
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,429
I'm pretty easily excited.

246
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:26,230
So, I can find myself saying yes to basically anything pretty quickly.

247
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,730
Before that, the trade-offs normally, you know, Becky or partners say, I haven't seen

248
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,789
you in a week or I'm, you know, doing something in the middle of a test match.

249
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,649
So, more as a way to control time.

250
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,529
Yeah, I heard this kind of, you know, someone talk about this tool where it's a, hell yes,

251
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,769
you know, I want to jump out of bed and do this.

252
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:50,750
If it's only a, yeah, I can do that, then, you know what, it's probably a no and think

253
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,610
about it down the track.

254
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,429
But, yeah, I've got a bit of a framework, I think, of things I think about.

255
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,070
Normally, it comes down to, yeah, is it a hell yes?

256
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,230
Is it going to be fun?

257
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,549
Is it going to be worth my time?

258
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:04,450
Because if it is, I'm all in.

259
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,070
Yeah, Pat, we're passionate about the self-reflection part of it and part of, I think, what you

260
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,350
did initially is take on a bit of self-reflection and talking to you before this, you went to

261
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,389
your coach, Justin Langer, and we're building an indicator tool so that people, you know,

262
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:19,970
are listening in.

263
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,509
And, you know, to me, you don't have to be.

264
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,509
You don't have to be the captain of the Australian career team or the vice captain or CEO of

265
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,570
an organisation to want to be a great leader.

266
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,809
You can impact people, you know, in your office without a title and you can start that journey.

267
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,129
And we're passionate about people taking on some reflection around those around us.

268
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,970
And you were saying before, maybe you had your time again, you'd survey a bit more deeply

269
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,450
around the team or even the captain of the team that you're in at the moment.

270
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,970
Is that something you're passionate about, actually, firstly, starting with some data

271
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,730
on what you're like as a leader?

272
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:49,490
For sure.

273
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,490
Yeah, I'm quite...

274
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,230
Yeah, data-driven in a lot of things I do.

275
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,730
You know, cricket, I love looking at stats and building my intuition and can't feel that

276
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,009
way.

277
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,909
I don't know, it's just the way I'm wired.

278
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:05,990
But objective feedback, like the 360-degree, you know, review or the, you know, the leadership

279
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,649
tool, it's so good to work out where do I think of myself?

280
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,789
And then that kind of starts the conversation.

281
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:18,370
I think if you do it in the reverse, you're kind of anchored to the point of most people

282
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,409
as a rule are pretty, you know, good people.

283
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,929
They're gentle and don't want to hurt you.

284
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,590
So, you're kind of anchored at a different point as opposed to you've got the hard data

285
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:26,789
there.

286
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,769
I really like that.

287
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,730
So, I find that really helpful.

288
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,909
I guess a lot of the space is not being captain.

289
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:38,649
I don't work as directly with, you know, management or some things around as opposed

290
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,590
to, you know, specifically, say, teammates or painting.

291
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,330
That was just a couple of the areas where I'd probably go and get further feedback from

292
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:46,590
others.

293
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,909
But the more you can do that and create a bit of a feedback system...

294
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,350
Yeah, we'll send out some links.

295
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,629
We encourage you to have a think about that.

296
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,250
If you're listening to Pat Cummings, you want to start your own self-reflective leadership

297
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,750
journey, the Leader Indicator Tool, send a link out how you can get involved in that.

298
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,350
And we're sort of seeing this shift, Pat.

299
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,570
I'm not sure you're a younger generation than me, but the old 20th century I talk about

300
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,889
a lot is hierarchy.

301
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,529
And, you know, I certainly worked into a professional sporting environment at the age of 17.

302
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,330
You didn't say a word.

303
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,710
You didn't have any chance you'd have access to the senior coach.

304
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,529
And you were terrified.

305
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:22,629
You were terrified, really, to put your hand up.

306
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,610
Whereas, you know, in sporting organizations, we're seeing now that, you know, young people

307
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,570
have got more of a voice and their voice is respected.

308
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:31,649
Are you seeing that?

309
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:35,029
Are you seeing that in your environments now that you really have to collaborate from day

310
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,789
one and it doesn't matter of your status or how high up the pecking order you are?

311
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:39,669
Absolutely.

312
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,429
Yeah.

313
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,409
It's, I'll be the same, Darcy.

314
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,389
I think when I started, I was 17 or 18 and I was looking around the change room and, you

315
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,549
know, it's probably half a dozen guys have played a hundred tests.

316
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,029
So, I didn't say boo, but earlier now you see a lot of young guys who are confident in

317
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,649
their own game to make the international side.

318
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,070
They've done well domestically.

319
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,730
And to be honest, I love seeing those new guys and learning of them because they've

320
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,849
got no inhibitions.

321
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,210
Now, that little bit of naivety is great.

322
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,309
I love seeing that because you can lose that by being in the system for, you know, 10 years.

323
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,710
So, you know, I almost have to protect against the, every now and then I think, you know,

324
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,970
this guy's played a hundred tests.

325
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,210
This guy's...

326
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,490
Played one.

327
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,670
He's definitely got an opinion and it's definitely worthwhile, but you probably give more weight

328
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,829
to the guy who's seen it and been around a lot longer, but it's great.

329
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,710
You get so many different ideas and I think that's changed even in the last kind of five

330
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:35,970
years.

331
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,549
You walked in as a 17-year-old and you went straight out of the Wanderers Stadium in South

332
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,809
Africa.

333
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,910
You took six wickets, Pat, in your first test.

334
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,190
That's a way to make an impact and get a voice.

335
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,910
Can you take us back to there?

336
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:51,609
Did you feel instantly that, hang on, there was a level of respect that maybe 17-year-olds,

337
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,309
17-year-olds aren't afforded after your first up effort?

338
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:55,490
Yeah, perhaps.

339
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:02,630
So, I think I was glad that I felt like I at least belonged and I guess probably more reasons

340
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,130
why I shouldn't have been picked than I was, but I was kind of backed in.

341
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,390
So, I was really glad to, I guess, repay that faith, but by no means.

342
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,269
I remember, well, as soon as I played that first test, I was injured and out of, you

343
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:21,150
know, action for about nine months and I just remember desperate to play a second test and

344
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,009
prove myself again because so many people were, you know, I guess saying, oh, how good

345
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:26,609
was that debut?

346
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,849
You know, you belong, whatever it is.

347
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:29,670
And I felt the opposite.

348
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,630
I was looking around at Ricky Ponting and Mitchell Johnson, these guys, and thought,

349
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,049
you know, I'm so far away from those guys and what they've achieved.

350
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,549
So, I didn't really believe the hype or try not to let myself believe the hype.

351
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,369
You had a six-year break between that and getting back in the test arena.

352
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:49,309
So, you had a bit of time, went through a huge amount of injuries, as we know.

353
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,069
What did you learn about yourself in that?

354
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,089
Quite a lot.

355
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:58,670
It was an age between, yeah, I guess, 18 years old and 23, which is, you know, a big stage

356
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,410
in anyone's life.

357
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,650
You know, I moved out of home.

358
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,390
You're kind of turning from a school student into an adult.

359
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:08,589
So, I think you have a lot of lessons and you learn a lot about yourself along the way.

360
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:13,450
But by the end of that stage, the one big thing I learned was, you know, patience and,

361
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,670
you know, you want everything now as a kid.

362
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:20,509
And unfortunately, that just isn't the best way or the most sustainable way.

363
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:24,930
So, you've just got a level of acceptance by the time you're a little bit older.

364
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,829
So, again, you get, you know, you meet a lot of good people along the way.

365
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,150
So, I think becoming, you know, a better judge of character of different people.

366
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,930
And, yeah, I think through that time, I got a bit more life experience.

367
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,809
As I said, I moved out of home.

368
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,789
I did a university degree.

369
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,690
I still got to travel the world and play some cricket all around the world.

370
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,950
So, you know, having a full-time job, all these things, yeah, I guess, culminated into,

371
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:51,309
you know, who I am now.

372
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:55,990
And do you feel like experiencing that, you know, the position you are now at 28 years

373
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,369
of age, is that potentially going through a pretty tough time, you know, being injured

374
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,170
for that amount of time?

375
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,829
Do you think that's going to give you more longevity or would you, you know, that's

376
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,809
maybe the wrong question.

377
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,470
Would you change it?

378
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,089
If you look back now, do you think it's actually stood you in good stead?

379
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:11,930
Yeah.

380
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,329
I mean, I guess you can lament the years lost where I wasn't playing and, you know,

381
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,990
look up now and I've played 30 on tests.

382
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,450
I wish that was 60 or 70, but it was a waste of time for sure.

383
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,069
Physically, I got a lot stronger.

384
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:31,549
Yeah, I grew up and I guess that's the other thing I learned was, yeah, there's not a huge

385
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:31,950
rush.

386
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,490
You know, a 12-year career is just fine.

387
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,569
It doesn't have to be a 14-year career.

388
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,009
So, a lot of the things that happened, I was glad when I look back at it.

389
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,599
When Australia is successful in cricket, the whole pulse of the nation, you know, feels

390
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:01,200
better about themselves and, you know, hearing JL talk in recent times about wanting to make

391
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,220
Australians proud and there was some controversy in South Africa coming back and trying to

392
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,099
reboot the team after Sampo Brigade issues.

393
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,400
Do you feel that, you know, that pressure, I suppose, as a leader in the Australian cricket

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,599
team that there's the whole country riding behind your success?

395
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,160
Yeah.

396
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,160
I think there's a real ownership that's felt by, you know, fans.

397
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,960
As a kid, I felt that.

398
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,319
I felt like that's our team.

399
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
We're taking on the world.

400
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah.

401
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah.

402
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,220
Yeah.

403
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,240
Yeah.

404
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,259
Yeah.

405
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:26,319
Yeah.

406
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:26,339
Yeah.

407
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:26,359
Yeah.

408
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:26,380
Yeah.

409
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah.

410
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,440
Yeah.

411
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,460
Yeah.

412
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,599
Live and die by the results sometimes.

413
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,480
You know, we kind of, it's a weird thing about, you know, Australian culture.

414
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,819
We want us to be the underdogs, but we also want us to be the best in the world at the

415
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:37,299
same time.

416
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,200
So you're not going to please everyone.

417
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,460
I think you've got to make sure you're really strong on what you stand for and how you want

418
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,220
to go about it.

419
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,279
But, I mean, the upside of it is huge.

420
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,180
You know, my favourite moment of my career so far was World Cup in 2015 where we won

421
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,099
the World Cup in Melbourne.

422
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,140
Yeah.

423
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,180
Yeah.

424
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah.

425
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,220
Yeah.

426
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,279
Yeah.

427
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:55,299
Yeah.

428
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:55,359
Yeah.

429
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:55,640
Yeah.

430
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:55,660
Yeah.

431
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,220
Yeah.

432
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,599
Yeah.

433
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,279
You could do no wrong.

434
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,279
I mean, every single person in Australia was right behind you.

435
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,920
So, yeah, it's great.

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,880
I love that about our culture and we're really lucky in cricket to have that.

437
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,220
You've grown up with the world of social media.

438
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,220
It's escaped me, maybe for good or bad.

439
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,460
I'm getting some pressure to get into it, this later stage of my life.

440
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,519
How would you describe that?

441
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:22,559
I see a lot of professional athletes that I know that see an amazing opportunity but

442
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,160
an amazing challenge at the same time.

443
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,579
And, you know, the public can get access to you.

444
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,359
And see you in ways that other sports people haven't had to put up with in the past.

445
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,740
How do you deal with that?

446
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,700
I think it's easy to lose control of.

447
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,039
And that's the most important thing going into, you know, social media and putting yourself

448
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,039
out there is you've just got to know what you're signing up for.

449
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,119
So, you know, if you're entering the public space, there's going to be good, there's going

450
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,640
to be bad.

451
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,799
And, you know, honestly, I think for a lot of people, if you're not going to cope well

452
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
with that, you know, it'll be upside down.

453
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,420
It's not going to be the upside or the downside.

454
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, maybe it isn't a arena you should spend too much time in.

455
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,619
You know, for times I've felt on tour, I've just deleted Instagram or Twitter.

456
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,079
You know, I think Asher's last year was just a really busy time.

457
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,359
I just deleted it just because there's so much conversation and noise going on.

458
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,680
And as much as anything, it's a time-wasting tool, which I kind of feel like I need to

459
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
reset every now and then.

460
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,039
So every now and then I'll just delete it for a couple of weeks or a month.

461
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:26,380
And I always find I just use it slightly differently when I come back onto it.

462
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,839
But, I mean, it's great.

463
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:34,660
It's, you know, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, we couldn't speak to fans and, you know, kids

464
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,980
that, you know, so directly.

465
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,759
So with it brings so much opportunity, but no doubt you have to be careful.

466
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,519
So you literally, you delete it on your phone.

467
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,259
So it's not there and have a spell for a while.

468
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,160
That's a genuine thing that works for you to have a little just a break.

469
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,140
I suppose if your phone's pinging, you naturally go to it, don't you?

470
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,500
And that's not a bad way to handle it.

471
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:54,859
Yeah.

472
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,420
Or you're sitting in a hotel waiting.

473
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,740
You're waiting for the bus or you're sitting on the bus or whatever it is.

474
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:02,880
You find yourself 15 minutes has gone to scrolling something pointless.

475
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,160
So I just use it as a way to reset.

476
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,559
Yeah.

477
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,960
The amount of times you pull your phone out of your pocket and realise you don't have

478
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,460
the app, you go, oh, I would have just wasted 10 minutes, you know, traditionally.

479
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:21,960
Or, you know, people that seem so famous and so everywhere on Instagram, as soon as you

480
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
delete it, you go, oh, actually, they're not a part of my life.

481
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
And it's.

482
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,140
It's just funny.

483
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,359
You kind of, you know, each time I do it, I'm like, oh, actually, I haven't thought

484
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,140
about them for a month.

485
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,079
It's interesting.

486
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:37,740
Now, Pat, a lot of people listening will say, you know, it's the dream life.

487
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,079
You had your challenges, but 28 to travel the world and play at the level that you do.

488
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm always interested to maybe ask the question around a mistake or a poor decision you can

489
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,140
share.

490
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,900
I think it humanises people a little bit.

491
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,380
You look back and have not so much a regret, but think, God, if I.

492
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,039
Had my time again, I'd make a better decision.

493
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,940
Is there an example you can share on that front?

494
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,799
No specific example.

495
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,920
I think there was definitely some time where I thought I was pretty good.

496
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,920
You know, like early 20s, 19, where I look back and I, you know, achieved nothing really,

497
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,599
you know, played a few games here and there, but thought I was a bit of a hotshot.

498
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,259
I knew everything.

499
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,519
And, you know, so I wish I maybe did that a little bit differently.

500
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,400
Yeah, maybe some injuries kind of racing back thinking.

501
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,259
That next to it was the most important thing in the world as opposed to biding my time

502
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,720
and, you know, just waiting it out.

503
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:41,859
But, yeah, nothing drastic that I can think of other than, yeah, like any young kid, you

504
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,819
go through a phase where you think you're pretty good.

505
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,400
And I always try to remember that when I see some young guys come through that they are

506
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,240
young and you do change.

507
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,299
Like, there are years where you do really change.

508
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,220
Now, I'm interested as well in, you know, people like you live.

509
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,279
You know, busy lives and successful lives.

510
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,539
Are there things that you do every day that in your mind set you up to be successful?

511
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:05,460
Have you got any habits or routines that you might share with us?

512
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm not great in this space.

513
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,220
I try different little things at different stages.

514
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:17,039
So, you know, that's one thing I do struggle with is routine because we might be in England

515
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,559
on a test tour and then suddenly we're in India on a one-day tour where we're playing

516
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,859
finishing games at midnight.

517
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,259
So, like a sleeping and a daily routine.

518
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Always seems different.

519
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,299
You know, some of the things I try to do here at home, switch my phone off at night.

520
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:39,599
So, I leave it upstairs or I leave it in a different room just to take away a temptation.

521
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:46,180
I try and create space every day for just, I don't know, just being.

522
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,480
So, whether it's reading or just pottering around the garden, I just like a little half

523
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,559
an hour breather where I'm just, yeah, left to my own devices.

524
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,380
And yeah.

525
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,759
I'll say that that's probably the most simple things.

526
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,500
Now, I understand that you're not far away from being a father in October with your

527
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
beautiful partner.

528
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,420
Becky, have you thought about leadership through the eyes of being a dad?

529
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,920
Have you given that some thought?

530
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I have a little bit.

531
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Not as much as probably Becky wishes I had.

532
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Yeah.

533
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,420
Naturally, I think you go back to your own childhood and I was like, yeah, I had a great

534
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
childhood.

535
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
I've got two brothers, two sisters.

536
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
Parents were great.

537
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
So, yeah.

538
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,920
You try and take the best things, I guess, out of that.

539
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,299
And then, yeah, just how do I want to, kind of what life do I want to, yeah, give the

540
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,299
child.

541
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,299
So, yeah.

542
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,299
I've thought a little bit.

543
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm sure I'll think of more ideas, but at the moment, my head goes to playing sport,

544
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,180
getting up to mischief as opposed to probably reality, which would be nappies and no sleep

545
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
for a little while.

546
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Yeah.

547
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I was having a look.

548
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
I've never been to the Blue Mountains.

549
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
But it just looks like a magic place.

550
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Yeah.

551
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
It's a magic place that you grew up.

552
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,279
And I see, as you said, you've got two brothers, two sisters, and it looks like an incredibly

553
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,180
close-knit family, the Cummins family.

554
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,559
And what was it like?

555
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,680
I mean, clearly, the person you are, we're all a product of our upbringing.

556
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,940
How would you describe it?

557
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,059
How has that influenced the person that you are?

558
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,059
Yeah.

559
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,059
Well, we had a big family.

560
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:21,059
It's a family of seven, five kids, and I was the youngest of three boys.

561
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,059
So, in terms of, I guess, a cricketing and sporting sense.

562
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:27,059
We were so sporty.

563
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:33,900
I remember we went on a big holiday, went on this one big holiday in my childhood, over

564
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,299
to Europe, and we took a football.

565
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,180
So every single photo in front of the Eiffel Tower or wherever we are, we're passing a

566
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
football.

567
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,680
Louvre Museum, we're passing a footy down the halls.

568
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,660
So just always active, always competitive.

569
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,059
We had a big backyard space.

570
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,059
Just fun.

571
00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:01,380
We were always up to plenty of different things, us kids and mum and dad, and there's always

572
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
adventure.

573
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,559
Mum and dad are really positive, happy, curious people.

574
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,420
So yeah, just had a great childhood.

575
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Really lucky.

576
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,799
I've just got an image of my learning to take kids on the Spanish Steps, kicking footies

577
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,940
off the top of that amongst the crowd and trying to take speckies.

578
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,660
It sounds like a similar upbringing, mate.

579
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,119
The footy goes everywhere.

580
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,180
It's like an appendage in a house.

581
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,500
My daughter is 16, so it's either in the DNA or it's not, isn't it, mate?

582
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
It comes with us everywhere.

583
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
I know.

584
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,099
We were in Paris, and my brother tried to drop kick over this huge tree and got stuck

585
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,099
up there.

586
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,500
So we spent a whole day in Paris, going to all the sports stores, trying to see if we

587
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
got a share in it.

588
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Well, you know, Phil, man, I've seen you kick the footy pretty well, mate, as a big, classy

589
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
left footer.

590
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I mean, you grew up in rugby league heartland, really, in the west of Sydney.

591
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Did you see both codes?

592
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,819
Yeah, both codes.

593
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,819
It's actually one of my regrets.

594
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,819
I wish I played AFL as a kid.

595
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:03,660
Both my brothers played a little bit, but not till probably kind of mid-teens.

596
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,940
We had a school across the road with a big field, and we'd go there literally every afternoon

597
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,259
in winter, and we'd just try and slot goals with, you know, contests.

598
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:17,619
You had to kick right and left foot, and we'd be out there for hours till dark.

599
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,619
So I love the AFL.

600
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,500
The Swannies used to go into, you know, SCG and A&Z Stadium to watch the Swannies.

601
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Yeah.

602
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
The Swannies.

603
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
And, yeah, still follow along.

604
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Ah, brilliant.

605
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,380
Now, Pat, we've been trying to ask a series of questions, and I know you've been brilliant

606
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,779
to be part of what we're calling a Leader Connect and these little, you know, connection

607
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:41,039
pods we spoke about with Rob and Andy and Marcus Bontempele, and trying to identify

608
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,500
all the dimensions that we think make great leadership and asking, you know, incredible

609
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,880
leaders like yourself.

610
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,220
So I'm keen to get your thoughts on the dimensions of leadership as we see it.

611
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,500
I want to ask you firstly about self-leadership.

612
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
What does that mean to you?

613
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,259
You know, I'm a big believer that, you know, you control your own space and you take ownership

614
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:06,559
of that, and, you know, you'd be unwavering, you know, nothing can affect that.

615
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,059
You're in total control of that, but knowing that everyone else is different and appreciating

616
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,579
that and trying to be open-minded and curious and try and learn yourself.

617
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:21,500
But I think, you know, owning your own space and leading by example, know who you are and

618
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
who you want to be.

619
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
It's the easiest job in the world.

620
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Just be yourself.

621
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
So, yeah, I guess that's what it means to me.

622
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Yeah.

623
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
The idea of trying to be many things to many people is pretty tiring, isn't it?

624
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,259
And that's a fascinating answer because I've heard a lot of people exactly identify the

625
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,259
way you are, isn't it?

626
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,940
When you understand yourself, you don't have to try too hard.

627
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
You just do what you do.

628
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
How about the environment?

629
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,180
I suppose you give this some thought as the Vice-Captain of the Australian Career Team,

630
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,500
but how do you go about positively trying to impact others in your environment?

631
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah.

632
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:57,500
So, I try and be really consistent, you know, naturally, you know, I'm lucky, I feel like

633
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I'm quite a happy, positive person.

634
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,839
So, you know, I try and bring that to the table as much as I can, try to stay curious

635
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:11,039
and open-minded and create a safe space for people to be themselves and talk to.

636
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,279
And I think, you know, cricket side or any, you know, sporting side or office, you have

637
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,500
this kind of critical mass of where most of the people are.

638
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
And what makes them tick?

639
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
And even if that's different to me or someone else, trying to make sure we kind of encourage

640
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,759
that as much as we can and facilitate that.

641
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:34,319
In terms of vision, how do you go about creating your own vision and how do you go about sharing

642
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,319
that with others?

643
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,880
So, yeah, we've just gone through a bit of a process with the team and try and get everyone's

644
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,500
understanding of what's important, what's the next three, five years look like, where

645
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
do we want to put emphasis on and kind of go from there.

646
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
But I think everyone's understanding of what's important, what's the next three, five years

647
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
look like.

648
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Where do we want to put emphasis on and kind of go from there.

649
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,220
I think everyone's got different things that makes them tick, but the end goal is normally

650
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
pretty similar.

651
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,819
So if you talk about, you know, a cricket side, we want to win, but we want to have

652
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:08,420
good fun along the way, have great relationships and impact kind of as many people as we can.

653
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,460
So yeah, still kind of, that's a working process for sure.

654
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,500
What sort of feedback did you get from the guys in the Elita Connect group today around

655
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
vision?

656
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Yeah, I've got to go back to my notes here.

657
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,220
But yeah, again, they all systemize it, which, you know, I find great.

658
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,259
So someone like, you know, Andy, I hope I'm not speaking out of school, but he, for a

659
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:37,720
podcast and a really fun kind of duo, they still reach out to their employees of, okay,

660
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
where do you see us going?

661
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
This is what we're thinking about.

662
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,640
And they, you know, really do think ahead and of course, within that framework, there's

663
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,220
lots of fun along the way that changes, but making time, whether it's once a year or once,

664
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,900
every few months, just to allocate that, you know, time and preface it with, you know,

665
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,099
us cricketers, we hate talking about all the kind of business meetings types of stuff.

666
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:04,880
So it's, even if you preface it with, all right, the next hour, that's all we need.

667
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,639
Give us one good hour of concentration for the next six months and we'll forget about

668
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
it.

669
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,599
So yeah, that a few good tools.

670
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,300
I heard you mentioned curiosity a lot, and that is a dimension of leadership we talk

671
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
about a lot.

672
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,219
I think for us, it leads into learning and improvement.

673
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,219
Yeah.

674
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,460
And what do you think about curiosity and how do you, how do you approach learning?

675
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,039
I find it has a lot of benefits for me.

676
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:32,380
You know, first of all, I just find there's so much out there that interests me that I

677
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,460
don't know, or there's people out there that are interesting and I want to learn.

678
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,820
I find that, you know, just like watching a movie or a TV show for me, I sometimes prefer

679
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,219
reading or podcasts or just hearing different experiences outside sport, outside cricket.

680
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:54,059
So, you know, why I tap into that, I find it energising me sometimes when I'm feeling

681
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:59,280
like I'm not as stimulated as I, you know, want to be, you know, whether it's just, I've

682
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,380
been all out cricket and I just need something else.

683
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,980
I'll tell you the big one, which has been a benefit for me in this space is I find it

684
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,000
really takes pressure off performance.

685
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,340
The more things I'm interested in, and I feel like, you know, opportunities to, I don't

686
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,539
know.

687
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:17,619
Yeah.

688
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:17,679
Yeah.

689
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:17,780
Yeah.

690
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:17,840
Yeah.

691
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah.

692
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:17,920
Yeah.

693
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:17,940
Yeah.

694
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah.

695
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,039
Yeah.

696
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:18,079
Yeah.

697
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,139
Yeah.

698
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:18,179
Yeah.

699
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:18,199
Yeah.

700
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:18,239
Yeah.

701
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,380
Yeah.

702
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:26,599
I feel like all of it takes pressure away from performance.

703
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,460
I know that you have a bad day on the field.

704
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,099
Well, I'm going to be okay because I've got all these other things that interest me, all

705
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:38,019
these other people I've met and they really don't care whether I took five wickets or

706
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:38,840
went none for a hundred.

707
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:46,900
So as much as a pressure relieving tool as anything I find learning, you know, things

708
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,539
outside of cricket.

709
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:47,880
Yeah.

710
00:35:47,880 --> 00:36:10,239
Yeah, it's a brilliant insight, Pat. I'm fascinated by it. I've never thought of it that way around being curious actually helps you relieve pressure. And it's a smart way to think about it, isn't it? Because we do get into our narrow zones in your world, isn't it? People want to ask you directly about that all the time. But the diversity of interests, that's a fascinating way to think about it. Makes a lot of sense.

711
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:17,920
Communication is something that I think every leadership environment thinks about. What's your take on communicating with clarity?

712
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:36,420
There's a few things. For me, I think relationships is everything. So if you've got a good relationship with someone that's been built up over time and shared experiences, it's pretty easy to communicate on it clearly. They know it's coming from a good place. It's not coming out of the blue.

713
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:56,519
So I guess the groundwork along the way makes the messaging really easy. And then I guess a few little tools inside of that. I hate fluff. I hate jargon. If it's not needed, keep it clear and concise. We're cricketers, so we don't need big speeches.

714
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:06,400
It's just a couple of key points. There's a saying that gets said all the time before a long-winded point. It's always, oh, it goes without saying.

715
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,900
But then I'll say it anyway, and it takes five minutes. So those little things that annoy me, I just try and keep short and sharp.

716
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,320
I like that. Final one. How about collaboration? How important is that to you, and how do you go about it?

717
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:30,860
Of course, you don't know everything. So just try to get different points of views. Everyone sees the world slightly differently, specifically to, say, skills in cricket.

718
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:36,360
I know what I'm feeling and what I'm trying to achieve. Someone's from the outside's got a different...

719
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:55,340
Point of view. So I love listening to what they've got to say. And of course, you're your own filter. So yeah, don't take in everything. But everyone's been through and goes through so much more than yourself. So just collective, the powers in the collective.

720
00:37:55,699 --> 00:38:04,519
Thanks so much for sharing. Bonus question, mate. I'll finish on. I've been asking this across the series and questioning with that.

721
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,400
Who's the greatest leader in your team?

722
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:26,719
That's a good one. I mean, I'd say my parents. Mum and dad equally. Just both. We've raised five kids, but just in control of their life. Incredibly proactive, I guess, in everything they do. I'll say that. I think you can't get two better examples.

723
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:35,719
Nice place to start and a nice place to finish as well, Pat. It's been really great to catch up with you. I'm fascinated by the way your life has...

724
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:52,920
You've turned out with plenty more to come, mate, as a dad-to-be. Congratulations on that. And I know from talking to Matt and the guys, you've been incredible. And the life experiences that you've shared and collaborated with. So thanks so much for your time today on the Empowering Leaders podcast. It's been a great pleasure to speak with you.

725
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,900
No worries. Thanks, though, Darcy. Loved it.
