A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:53,399
Paul Little is one of Australia's most successful businessmen.

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,640
In 1985, Paul negotiated a management buyout

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,240
of the transport and logistics business Toll Holdings.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,060
He went on to serve as managing director of the Toll Group from 1986 to 2011.

15
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:09,200
In that time, Toll grew from an 18-truck operation worth $1.5 million

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,060
into an organisation with 45,000-plus employees in 50 countries,

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,939
eventually being sold to Japan Post for $6.5 billion.

18
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,500
Paul's creativity and success has expanded through the Little Group investment

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,400
in the property, technology, marine transport and lifestyle sectors.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,780
Paul and his wife, Jane Hanson, are very active philanthropists.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,480
The Hanson Little Foundation has a singular objective

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,819
to create a legacy of significant and positive change

23
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,159
that enables and inspires Australians.

24
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,900
Paul is the chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,519
and is the past chair of the Essendon Football Clubs and Visit Victoria.

26
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,760
Paul, extraordinary life of success and leadership that you've lived.

27
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,840
Did you have big ambition and big vision as a kid?

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,260
No, not really, Luke.

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,579
Thanks for the invitation to be here and it's great to chat to you.

30
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:07,200
No, I think as going through the education process,

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
you're not quite sure.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,599
You don't have a vision about where it's all headed,

33
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,639
but, you know, it sort of evolves, I think,

34
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:17,919
over time.

35
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,039
My ambition and my course, yeah.

36
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,520
You left school, you went to work as a trainee executive at Main Nicholas

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,900
and then you were studying at night at RMIT.

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Was there a desire within you at that early age to run your own business?

39
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,219
No, I'd like to be able to say it was,

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,780
but no, I really wanted to cut out a role in the corporate sector.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,780
That, to me, was the pathway that...

42
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,300
that I felt had the most upside.

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,159
But at that point in time, running and owning my own business wasn't part of it, no.

44
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,620
You diverted for a while,

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,039
and we'll talk about your incredible success in the transport industry,

46
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,060
but you ran a guest house and a motel business for three years.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
What was that chapter like and what did you learn from that?

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah, look, I think you have done your research.

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,879
Well done there.

50
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,139
I think at that point in time,

51
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:17,879
the corporate sector was...

52
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,419
was pretty cutthroat and I was a young man,

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,199
probably in a hurry to achieve things.

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,360
And I just felt after eight or nine years working with my original employer,

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,740
it was time for me to do something myself.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,419
And so I bought and ran a guest house down at Point Lonsdale.

57
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,479
You love history and I want to talk to you about your love of that

58
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,520
and restoring brilliant buildings and bringing them back to life is...

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,039
it seems a great passion.

60
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,139
I want to go back to 1985.

61
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,860
And you do a deal that is a management buyout of Toll Holdings.

62
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:55,360
Now, assuming you look back on that as a life-changing moment,

63
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,379
how hard was it to do a deal like that at the time?

64
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,860
Yeah, well, it was hard because I'd never borrowed significant amount of funding from anyone,

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,259
never had any debt of significance once again.

66
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,919
So I had to borrow, as I recall, something like $20 million

67
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,819
and then cut a deal with a group called...

68
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,839
Pico Walls End, who were a very large mining, a global mining group.

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:30,040
And for me, to say I felt somewhat out of my depth is not an exaggeration.

70
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,180
But as it turned out, we acquired the business, yeah.

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,819
And you went into the transport industry, highly competitive,

72
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,319
and a lot of people, you know, try and fail in that area.

73
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,500
You take over as managing director.

74
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,579
And when you look back, what was your point of difference?

75
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,800
Why did you have such extraordinary success?

76
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,480
Well, we ran it as a private company up until 93.

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,579
And then in 93, we decided that for the business to grow significantly,

78
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,040
which was a key requirement of success moving forward,

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,379
scale is terribly important in transport and logistics.

80
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,600
So we IPO'd or floated the business

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,420
and it turned out to be a success.

82
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,500
And it turned out to be a success.

83
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,560
And it turned out to be a success.

84
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:24,100
And I think that then gave us not only the funding we needed to grow,

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,959
but gave us the belief that we really could grow,

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,339
compete against the multinationals here in Australia,

87
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,439
but more importantly, compete against globally

88
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,139
and certainly within the Asia-Pacific region.

89
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,160
I read that you, over the course of the 28 years or so,

90
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,199
that you were invested significantly in Toll,

91
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,199
that you had 120...

92
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,560
I mean, clearly doing a deal that is a strength of you.

93
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,839
What is the secret to doing a good deal?

94
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,550
I think knowing what the industry that you're dealing.

95
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,149
I mean, I'm not being critical of bankers there

96
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,329
because clearly they have a different outlook.

97
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,470
But we became very good at identifying an opportunity,

98
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,970
transacting that opportunity,

99
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,509
and then importantly, integrating that back into,

100
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:19,769
into our business.

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,490
We became good at doing that.

102
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,810
And I think the secret, if there is one,

103
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,290
is really understanding and knowing the business

104
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,610
that you're acquiring.

105
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,870
I've been told by people around you

106
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,829
and doing some homework, Paul,

107
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,990
that you've also been prepared to walk away

108
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,209
from plenty of deals.

109
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,910
And is that the discipline?

110
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,769
If it doesn't fit your criteria,

111
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,050
you've walked away from as many as you've made.

112
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,509
Yeah, I think that was one of them.

113
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,149
I have a number of favourite sayings.

114
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:48,810
That's one of them.

115
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,089
And you've got to be prepared to walk away.

116
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,529
And if you're not,

117
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,089
then you'll compromise your negotiation

118
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,990
and probably not end up with a good deal.

119
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,750
So before you enter a deal,

120
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,430
you've got to be prepared not to do it.

121
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,290
Paul, there's probably one deal in your history

122
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,050
that had the most amount of publicity.

123
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,889
I want to ask you about it.

124
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,290
It was Toll acquiring the Steve Adoring giant, Patrick.

125
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,490
And Toll and Patrick were compared a lot

126
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,470
throughout your time.

127
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,230
You and Chris Corrigan,

128
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,829
they compared a lot, the CEO of Patrick at the time.

129
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,430
And there was a sense, you know,

130
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,149
reading a bit of the history and remembering at the time too

131
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,589
that the freight industry in Australia

132
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,230
maybe wasn't big enough for both of yours

133
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,430
and Chris's ambitions.

134
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,550
It got pretty personal, that one, didn't it?

135
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,269
He was attacking you regularly in the media.

136
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,930
I think he took out a full paid ad at one stage to attack.

137
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,430
And those who don't know the history,

138
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,050
I mean, Chris Corrigan was famous for him staring down

139
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,449
the unions in the waterfront dispute of 1998.

140
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,750
So you knew you were taking on a fairly combative person.

141
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,209
When you look back at that, what are your reflections

142
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,389
and would you change anything?

143
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:01,750
477 days is how long it took to complete.

144
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,769
So I'd certainly change that.

145
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,670
We, you know, if you knew it was going to be that ugly

146
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,930
and that personal and that length of time,

147
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,529
you may have had a second sort of thought about

148
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,970
whether or not you wanted to do it.

149
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,449
But no, look, I think it was absolutely

150
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,829
the right strategic move for Toll at that time.

151
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,669
However, ultimately succeeding and acquiring Patrick,

152
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,450
the competition regulator or the ACCC

153
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,029
then decided that we, Toll,

154
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,789
were becoming too significant.

155
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,169
In the Australian market.

156
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,269
So they forced sales on us of some of the assets

157
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,990
that we had acquired from Patrick,

158
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,950
which took the icing off the cake.

159
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,590
I mean, post the acquisition of Patrick,

160
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,830
we had revenues in excess of eight billion

161
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,549
and we had, more importantly,

162
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,950
an ability to influence in a positive way

163
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,950
the movement of goods.

164
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,870
Into and out of Australia,

165
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,950
which was the key sieve adoring asset that Patrick had.

166
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:28,990
And so from my point of view,

167
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,129
it was very successful.

168
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:33,330
And had we not been successful,

169
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,269
there's a reasonable argument that Patrick

170
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:40,009
could have ultimately acquired Toll.

171
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,690
Given that we were smaller than Patrick

172
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,009
and not as profitable as Patrick,

173
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,929
it was a very ambitious,

174
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,970
ambitious move.

175
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,309
At the end of the day,

176
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,210
we were successful and I think that really put Toll,

177
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,870
launched Toll into more of a,

178
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,090
I guess, a business that had global recognition,

179
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,750
not just within Australia.

180
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,909
I like, Paul, how you're able to say 477 days.

181
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:10,090
I mean, clearly, it takes some skin off you,

182
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,990
I'm assuming, when you go into that sort of negotiation.

183
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,590
And was it, is that as stressful a time as,

184
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,809
as you've had or?

185
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,809
Yeah, look, there've been a few.

186
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:21,950
I know we'll talk about Essendon shortly

187
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,629
and some of the stress that that job entailed.

188
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,909
But no, look, from a corporate point of view,

189
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,889
it was three to four years of distraction,

190
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,049
three to four years of knowing that if we succeeded,

191
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,210
it would be amazing.

192
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,269
If we didn't succeed, it would be a pretty painful exit.

193
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,789
So, yeah, it doesn't come without, though.

194
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:54,169
There's, I guess, realizations, but we did get there and it was an amazing acquisition

195
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,570
and the right one for Toll.

196
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,750
Well, we might segue, Paul, because you've done it for me into your chapter as Essendon

197
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,750
president.

198
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,210
And for those that aren't familiar with the story, in 2013, Paul steps up as president

199
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,629
at the Essendon Football Club, a club that you've loved all your life.

200
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,809
But it's in the middle of arguably the biggest sporting challenge that a club's faced in

201
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,809
Australian history.

202
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,809
It wouldn't be two.

203
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,889
It's a bigger call, I don't think, to make.

204
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:24,409
ASADA, the Australian Doping Authority, and the World Anti-Doping Authority, WADA, were

205
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,370
conducting an investigation into what was known as the Supplements Saga.

206
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,070
It took four years investigations, legal proceedings.

207
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,570
In the end, 34 players were banned for a two year period.

208
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,070
And it devastated individuals.

209
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,649
It was a horrible time in the industry.

210
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,649
What are your reflections?

211
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,649
I mean, for you to put your hand up at that time, it must have been incredible.

212
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:46,649
It must have been a wonderful time.

213
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:54,570
tough time but when you look back on it what do you feel about it yeah um not a lot has changed

214
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:03,669
for me uh on how i sort of um felt about it then and now um i think i think it was fair to say it

215
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:10,309
wasn't in the middle of of this investigation it was right at the outset and um not that that

216
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:15,669
would have changed a lot either i mean the the then chair and i was deputy chair

217
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:22,809
um for health reasons couldn't uh or didn't wish to continue and so without a lot of

218
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:31,029
notice um i was found myself in the role had i'd known it was going to take so long

219
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:39,809
and being once again quite um uh quite ugly from a personal point of view um you know maybe it

220
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:40,289
would have made me feel better but i think it would have made me feel better and i think it

221
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:40,309
would have made me feel better and i think it would have made me feel better and i think it would

222
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:48,330
more determined to continue rather than less so but um uh it was a a particularly difficult time

223
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:57,669
we started off uh we the club we the board started off uh having uh not a lot of knowledge about what

224
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:09,909
was about to unfold um and i i think um being on the back foot then um meant that uh it was difficult

225
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:16,870
to get ready and prepare and and and uh probably fight as hard as we could have or should have

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:26,309
at that point in time um so being on the back foot and being um attacked uh not only by those

227
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:33,210
organizations that you mentioned but by by the press and and a couple of um journalists in

228
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,889
particular uh just meant that i spent most of my time um trying to explain the the the

229
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:49,529
what really happened and and um rather than um trying to find reasons for um uh the a lot of the

230
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:56,769
accusations being um uh unfounded and paul i think i always go to the personal stories because i look

231
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,830
it's a pretty small community the afl community and i've been lucky enough to be part of it all

232
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,110
all of my working life and you see you know legendary people like james heard and and you

233
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,809
know david evans was the chairman you spoke about whose families had an enormous history in the

234
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:15,950
game as as you're aware um leave alone the 34 players who were devastated have you got a sense

235
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:23,450
that what happened to to those individuals was was unfair oh there's no question and and um uh you

236
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:31,669
know no player was ever charged uh with uh an offense of taking performance enhancing drugs or

237
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:39,330
i should say none no one was ever found guilty um of taking performance enhancing drugs and um

238
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:48,049
i knew that i had not the slightest doubt about that being the case but as i said before there

239
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:55,909
was a wall of criticism there that was very difficult for us to get over um and so was it

240
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:03,470
unfair terribly unfair um and impacted so many lives i mean um the the players their families

241
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:09,250
and one of the jobs i had on a regular basis was to talk to the families

242
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:19,230
um of the players because these young men probably didn't have the the the knowledge or the um i guess

243
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:26,070
courage to sit down with their um mother and father and girlfriend and whoever else and try

244
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,610
and explain that you know they hadn't hadn't done what they were being accused of doing i mean it's

245
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:38,610
a pretty difficult situation all around so um yeah it was a um

246
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:47,210
uh it was a tough time and unfortunately for me you rightly uh pointed out that uh eston is a club

247
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:54,190
that i've loved and enjoyed for many many years um i never really got the opportunity to uh to

248
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:02,149
enjoy it as a chairman or president of a footy club uh i just felt that uh i was just fighting a

249
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:08,250
a fight the whole time i was in that role if you look back i mean what what should have and could

250
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,789
have been done differently to avoid a fight and to avoid a fight and to avoid a fight and to avoid a fight

251
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:16,250
the enormous pain that the individuals faced and the industry faced and i suppose everyone around it

252
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,450
there was there was shrapnel going everywhere for anyone that was anywhere near eston at the time

253
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:27,409
yeah well having a couple of the other um clubs giving me advice along the way i didn't appreciate

254
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:33,929
so they you can you can put those individuals and those clubs to one side what should have

255
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:39,590
happened i i don't think anyone should be treated as being guilty and until they've been found to be

256
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,789
guilty

257
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:49,190
and and um um sure do i hate drugs in sport absolutely and there's no question about that

258
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:57,309
but we we were um and and some of the individuals you mentioned james in particular who's a close

259
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:05,549
personal friend um was being treated as a as a guilty person in this process and and they weren't

260
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,589
and and they they never were um in my um

261
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:18,670
my estimation um um nor should they have been um put through what they were put through so

262
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:29,509
uh it was um not only was it uh could it have been avoided um look i i think the afl in hindsight and

263
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:36,309
the people running the afl at the time probably needed to be a bit stronger in in the role that

264
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,589
they played um and um

265
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:47,549
once again um we spent a lot of our time just trying to refute some of the um um

266
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,849
the the pretty wild accusations that were out there about what the club had been doing

267
00:17:53,849 --> 00:18:00,230
we'll change uh tact uh paul and people listening to this we'll see your life and how it's unfolded

268
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,210
and it's littered with with success everywhere if uh if you're giving advice to someone who's

269
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,650
thinking about being an entrepreneur or a leader in whatever environment you're in i'm not going to

270
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:09,789
do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that

271
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,230
they're in i mean what lessons have you learned along the way that you would pass on

272
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,410
yeah well i think um and and thank you for saying i've been successful in everything i've known i'm

273
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:31,210
not quite sure that uh that's exactly uh right but um look i i think uh you you really do need to

274
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:39,650
have a clear knowledge around what it is you're trying to achieve and and sure people can learn

275
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:48,150
and and um um can improve their their own knowledge and understanding of a particular area but people

276
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:55,029
look at me and say you've made some uh wonderful decisions in the um the building and construction

277
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:02,009
industry for example and i i would say to them i've spent my whole life in that industry this

278
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:07,789
isn't something that the the taxi driver told me i should do this is something that i fully believe

279
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,490
in and and then i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not

280
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:19,589
i surround myself with people who um are capable of working with me to achieve outcomes and um

281
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:27,710
so i i i think building the team around you really understanding the industry and and not

282
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,509
sort of over overstepping the mark when it comes to what you're investing in or what you're trying

283
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:39,470
to achieve have some um have a plan and uh don't sort of

284
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,589
try and go outside that plan that would be my advice yeah and you've had a clear plan as well

285
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:49,869
in in terms of giving back and the handsome little uh foundation in combination with uh

286
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:56,289
with your wife is doing some extraordinary things and and i mentioned your love of history one of

287
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:01,109
the projects that that springs to mind is that the little hall at melbourne university can you

288
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:04,609
give people an insight into your thinking because that's a really fascinating way that you've gone

289
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,230
about giving back you you've built a building at melbourne university can you explain that project

290
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,569
and why that means so much to you yeah it really started with i suppose uh jane my wife and and

291
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:25,650
myself being uh keen to bring more to the table and simply just funding um a program and uh jane's

292
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:32,450
involvement at melbourne university gave her an insight into what um as she felt was an an

293
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:39,470
opportunity to identify and then um uh create opportunity

294
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:46,549
and roadways for for some scholars that were were brilliant scholars that that perhaps had

295
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:55,250
family issues that didn't allow them to realize their dreams so we created a pathway for those

296
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,130
scholars to be identified and then put in a very nurturing uh helpful environment and then i guess

297
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:08,569
my uh part of the um uh the overall outcome there was to um to build

298
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:17,289
design and build a student accommodation that um uh was better than the normal student accommodation

299
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:27,130
and and um um the location the design of the building uh the um uh all of the other um uh

300
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:36,269
abilities for a a building like little hall to be um with uh theater space and and libraries and

301
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:37,809
and meeting rooms so

302
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:48,269
we put it all together got the blessing of melbourne uni and um out of the 699 or 669 i should say

303
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:56,049
beds in little hall um there's there's a quite a high percentage now probably around 50 to 60 of

304
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:04,390
them are occupied by these um scholars who um are outstanding young uh australians and uh so

305
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,430
we're nurturing them through the pro through their um

306
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:16,509
time at melbourne uni but also um creating a need with the um with the um student accommodation that

307
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:22,789
in our view needed to be upgraded in terms of quality to some extent yeah it's a it's a

308
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,769
brilliant story and legacy project of giving back and opportunity for those that wouldn't have had

309
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,849
it previously there's a lot of diversity in your life i didn't realize that you were

310
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:36,529
passionate uh into doing my research uh motorsport enthusiasts you you drove

311
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:43,569
at a high level and and now the chairman of the grand prix corporation you had um successful v8

312
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:51,329
supercar team for a period of time where did that passion come from um that's a good question i i

313
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:58,490
think as a young man um i and this might explain my involvement in logistics too but i loved

314
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:06,450
anything that effectively was on wheels and moved and to some extent i love the challenge of uh a

315
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,650
competition and so i think it's a great question and i think it's a great question and i think it's a

316
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:07,789
great question and i think it's a great question and i think it's a great question and i think it's a

317
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:14,910
so motor racing was a logical extension of all of that um from my point of view uh once again did

318
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:21,549
i start off with a long-term plan of owning a team and and competing in a in a team no not

319
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:30,250
necessarily but but one thing leads to another and uh we we've had uh quite a successful time

320
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:37,309
in in motorsport and of course now the um australian grand prix corporation has just uh

321
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:47,069
been uh blessed with the um the the uh largest um occupancy uh of of fans through the gate

322
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:55,869
um for this year's um grand prix an amazing um success story and one that i think will see the

323
00:23:55,869 --> 00:24:01,769
grand prix corporation go on to bigger and better things uh moving forward i'm fascinated by uh that

324
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,509
jumping off on that for a moment and it's been such a huge piece of melbourne obviously the

325
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:12,769
grand prix started in in adelaide initially but the resurgence of fans back to the sport and and

326
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:18,029
i can't help but link it to the netflix series drive to survive and the impact that's had i mean

327
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:24,109
i have got to confess to not being a sport that i am a great follower of but that series has brought

328
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:27,890
it to life for me understanding the characters sitting down with my wife who's the least

329
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:33,769
motorsport but she's interested in the spot are you linking the success of that show look i i think

330
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,349
um um there's

331
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:42,210
no question it's had an impact uh globally not just within australia and interesting we

332
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:48,930
we monitor um all sorts of things at the grand prix corp and and the numbers of females that

333
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:55,690
are now following the sport um and and let's say through the gate for the grand prix meeting

334
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:06,269
itself uh has moved up to 60 it was 40 so men and women have have really um both enjoyed that

335
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:14,490
drive to survive show but also the uh the knock-on effect of that and um i i think um i really do

336
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:21,950
believe that the australian grand prix corporation has run such a successful event not just this

337
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:30,309
year but in previous years that we're capable of um uh helping formula one uh grow its business

338
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:36,269
and and um in the within the region so that's we're quite ambitious

339
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:49,049
about being able to do that well on this podcast i've been speaking to a range of different leaders

340
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,730
from from successful business people like you to to young musicians in the arts who are trained

341
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,170
changing their uh space and we see leadership now as being this uh doesn't necessarily require a

342
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,910
title we we see people being able to bring leadership from all walks of life so i've been

343
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,250
asking a series of questions because we see some synergy in what leadership looks like so please

344
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,049
to all the leaders please be expansive as as you like um or as or as

345
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:18,190
short as you like as well but we see one of the first traits balls of people who are um consistently

346
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,190
successful in leadership have an idea of what self-leadership means to them what does that

347
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:28,789
term mean to you when i say self-leadership well success doesn't just happen it's caused

348
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:39,490
and and uh i you know i i have um uh very strong ideas around um bringing together um

349
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,309
the people needed the skills the people needed the skills the people needed the skills the people

350
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:50,869
needed um and the timing needs to be right to to achieve an outcome that it and it may be

351
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:58,029
philanthropy it may be in sport and it may be in business so i i think the model that i use if i

352
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:03,430
can call it a model is something that i believe in and and something that's worked well for me

353
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,369
yeah and they tell me that your own self-discipline is pretty strong or even through the the full-on

354
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:12,190
years that your your fitness and your training and your and your

355
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:19,369
healthy approach to to food and along the way is that has that been part of part of you uh look it

356
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:25,390
it's not something that i've found difficult it's something i enjoy doing uh i enjoy having energy i

357
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,890
enjoy feeling fit and strong and um i enjoy the satisfaction having had um a good workout for

358
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:40,210
example so i i think from my point of view that's um that's an easy one leaders we see now a

359
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,309
dimension of their leadership pool is they're really conscious of their leadership and they're

360
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:45,450
they're really conscious of how they positively impact others and i and i picked up the phone i

361
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,009
rang a few people in preparation and then they were very adamant that the total success was very

362
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:55,509
much that people love working in that environment with you and for you and under you and that you

363
00:27:55,509 --> 00:28:00,150
create an environment that people love going and they felt engaged in it has that been something

364
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:06,369
you've been conscious of how you impact those in your environment yeah i i think in empowering

365
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:12,190
people around you um is something that i get the most satisfaction

366
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:20,869
out of um um and and you know at toll that certainly there's one very quick quick example

367
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:27,569
of uh you made mention of the the corrigan um incident let's call it uh the acquisition and

368
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:36,930
and um i called my 20 key guys together at crown one day and said look um we're in this fight um

369
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,390
it's the right fight to be in um but what i want from you

370
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,289
is to

371
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,769
go away and run the business for me uh for as long as it takes now

372
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:54,170
to allow me to focus on trying to win this other uh fight that or um acquisition that we're in

373
00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:01,329
um and i'd have to say the response from empowering those key people um was amazing

374
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:09,869
we we made for uh six or twelve month periods we made record profits um and to me it didn't come

375
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,190
as a surprise at all it was

376
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,890
something i knew that uh we'd probably been getting ready for even if uh it hadn't been

377
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,910
obvious at the time yeah and you do that uh now from from what i can see as well paul you know

378
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,650
the the portfolio stuff you're interested in is diverse there's technology uh startups you've got

379
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,930
the property business which you say a long history clearly with toll was a big property owner and

380
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:40,009
business as well but you you run a ferry service between uh geelong and and and melbourne and which

381
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,170
was creative uh idea the long-term and the long-term and the long-term and the long-term

382
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,369
lifestyle assets and you've just renovated historic hotel in in port arlington so is that

383
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,549
the same when you talk about empowering someone for those listening how do you practically go

384
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,289
about it is it this is your team this is your division i'm going to set you up for success

385
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:05,230
can you give us some more detail on that uh well i think um there's no point in uh telling

386
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:12,029
someone you're going to empower them unless you really do so you you become almost um

387
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,230
an advisor to the person who's doing the role that you want them to do they have a clear

388
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,109
understanding they have full control um they have the power to whether it's higher or fire or or

389
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:34,750
fund or not fund or whatever so you you really need to hand over the business to them um and you

390
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,130
become as i said before someone that they can speak to if they have an issue or a problem or

391
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,690
hopefully an opportunity

392
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:50,450
so i i think uh yeah whether it's the ferries um or the um any of the lifestyle assets that we've

393
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,289
got but but i think with the ferries it was a bit different because uh governments uh were involved

394
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:02,970
they're really keen to see this part of melbourne's transport grow and build and we needed some help

395
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:11,650
to do that and um i i also have uh um i i believe good relationships with state and federal government

396
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,170
which have

397
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,109
helped us in in that that sort of situation there paul we see leaders are really clear

398
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:22,289
on how they create and share their vision the vision for toll you can still read it it was

399
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:29,210
about being the preeminent uh logistics uh provider in in asia and you you went on to to to

400
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,470
achieve that how did you go about you know not only that vision but the vision you've got for

401
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:40,430
all the other things that you're trying to achieve um well you don't just wake up one morning and all

402
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,170
of a sudden you have a vision for what it is that you're trying to achieve and you're trying to

403
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:49,029
do whatever it is you want to do i i think it it um um it happens over a period of time but

404
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:57,990
you you you see the opportunity you assess whether these are commercial um observations i suppose you

405
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:04,190
you you assess whether or not you can make money out of it because whilst i love doing philanthropy

406
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:10,589
and and working with groups like the footy club and different ones i also enjoy having successful

407
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,170
commercial uh activities and i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

408
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:19,509
um and assuming you can make money and assuming you've got the right people to help you do it

409
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:30,349
then um you you you push the button and off you go um uh i i continually say to my family i'm going

410
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:37,430
to try and declutter my life um but at this point in time i haven't been successful in doing that

411
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,150
um i do enjoy being um busy i do enjoy being

412
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:48,390
running successful entities and and they're not all successful some some are quite challenging

413
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,970
but uh from my point of view um i'd i'd hate to become boring i don't wish to become boring

414
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,710
because i enjoy so much what i do yeah just picking up on that paul though you know clearly

415
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:06,150
your commercial success has been uh you know incredible path that you followed and and and

416
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:11,450
the tale story speaks for itself but you you don't you know do the things that you've done

417
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,170
without purpose and you don't do the things that you've done without purpose and you don't do the

418
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:17,750
passion involved in our machine you don't take on a a challenge like acquiring you know patrick's

419
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,750
without that sense of what was that sense of purpose in you was it about creating a successful

420
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,650
business or was there a love of the transport industry was it a i think it's not so much the

421
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:35,710
love of the industry but the the belief that i you know to to to put it uh i can't put any other

422
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,170
way i was quite good at it and so we're our team we were good at it and we knew that and and uh

423
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:50,569
we were good at it not just um locally here but comparing ourselves against other global players

424
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:57,769
we firmly believed we could achieve it if we had the courage the funding the you know all the

425
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:07,789
ingredients needed to be there um but it you know it it um i guess the greater the reward the greater

426
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:12,050
the risk quite often too and um i guess taking on the the the the the the the the the the the the

427
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,170
the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

428
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:19,869
taking risks and managing those risks is a big part of uh how at toll in particular we were so

429
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,670
successful paul we see leaders are really curious that word comes up all the time a real dimension of

430
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,309
of leadership is is curiosity and then a lot of leaders through their curiosity

431
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:33,610
approach how they continually learn and develop that does that resonate with you

432
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:40,989
um i'm not sure i understand what you mean by curiosity in that sense well we see leaders

433
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,050
constantly

434
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:48,730
wondering what is around them that they can learn from how they can you know whether they digest

435
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,710
information through reading or through other people and they they have this innate sense of

436
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:02,110
of wanting to understand things is that yeah i i often i mean i i look at you and wonder um

437
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:07,769
i suppose whether i could do that job you know and and i'm always looking i see a building and

438
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:11,909
i think i wonder if i could build that building or you know i wonder if i could build that building

439
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:18,190
if i'd be good at running that team or not and and i'm quite realistic with myself i don't sort of

440
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:24,909
it's not a love affair with myself but but so i think in that sense yeah the curiosity

441
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:34,050
um is probably a good word because um um i um i love one thing i do love is seeing

442
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:40,949
um the the um the a visible result of what it is i've been doing

443
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:41,889
is important to me and i think it's important to me and i think it's important to me and i think

444
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:46,630
it's important to me as whether it's building a building or creating a premiership team or

445
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:54,469
building a ferry or a renovating an old hotel or whatever um i i do like to be able to um

446
00:35:54,469 --> 00:36:01,789
uh i know i know one of the the people who um murray rants who you know i say to murray all

447
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,570
the time take photos of it send me the photos i want to see the photos of it so every time he

448
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,889
goes to one of these businesses um you know he's got he's he's out there taking photos

449
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:20,989
and sending them to me so i i just think having um uh a real time um way of determining our

450
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:29,130
progress and how we're going um is uh has always and still is important to me yeah great afl

451
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,349
footballer murray rants from the west coast eagles and my old club the bulldogs and his son alex end

452
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:39,250
up becoming one of the legendary players in recent times as well i know he's heavily involved in in

453
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,869
in running your your projects and uh have

454
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:47,449
crossed paths with with uh murray before and he he clearly speaks highly of the way you guys

455
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:53,929
work together we see great leaders uh paula uh very much aware of their communication and how

456
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:59,110
they communicate i mean you end up with a business that's got 40 plus thousand employees in 50

457
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:06,090
countries how have you gone about communicating when you've had that sort of scale yeah it's a

458
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:11,789
real challenge um but but terribly important that they want to know there's a real person

459
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:17,309
sitting there behind the desk and not not a cardboard cutout so one of the things that

460
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:24,929
i did um probably to the detriment of you know your family um life and the whole thing is that

461
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:33,429
i would constantly be traveling and um i would um uh back in the tall time in particular um

462
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:41,429
every second week we'd be off somewhere around the world so so that's a um i mean i love the

463
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:47,429
technology is kicking the tires i mean i love doing that um and i love talking to the people

464
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:54,949
that are running the uh the the particular um job that we're we're um we're looking at but

465
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:04,650
um it it's a balance and finding that balance um has become easier for me with um uh doing more

466
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:11,610
things from a family point of view now particularly the the philanthropy um is very much uh something

467
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:20,869
that um the family my wife in particular is uh heavily involved in and um uh so i i think you've

468
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:25,949
you've got to be um you've got to be conscious of the need to balance things up you can't just

469
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:33,210
embark on this amazing uh sort of vision or dream that you have it's got to be done in a reasonable

470
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,710
way yeah i'm passionate about the family balance question paul and i was was planning to get there

471
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,590
at some point i mean you're the father of uh of three you tragically lost your first child and

472
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:49,409
first wife uh to cancer back in 1991 and um you know i'm assuming the the challenges around that

473
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:54,989
did you have i mean you sound like a really system and an organized person did you you're trying to

474
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:59,230
grow this extraordinary business did you have the the sort of systems to make sure that you got

475
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:07,250
the family time as well how did you go about that well i've always um and it's fairly simplistic i

476
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,190
guess but i've always said that i don't take work home with me and i

477
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:19,650
just won't do that uh do i thrash around at night no i don't um do i work weekends uh if it's at all

478
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:26,309
possible i don't and so i think if you there's got to be that sort of interaction with the with

479
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:32,909
the family um but uh you'd be better off asking my wife that she would probably say that i haven't

480
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:39,150
really succeeded in that area but i am very conscious of it yeah we see poor leaders uh

481
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,409
very uh aware of collaboration

482
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,510
as a dimension of their leadership uh was that important to you along the way and how did you go

483
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:55,369
about it um oh everyone needs to collaborate i mean you you just don't have all the answers you

484
00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:01,630
don't have quite often you need reassurance yourself um so whether you're collaborating

485
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:09,829
with your family which is the the way that i love to do it um um or whether you have one or two

486
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,590
people that you you use as a way to collaborate with your family or whether you have one or two

487
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:18,030
sounding board um whether it's the bank manager and probably doesn't matter much but you really

488
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:26,130
get well it does matter but you really do need um to uh i think reassure yourself occasionally

489
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,809
that you're heading down the right path i mean people think that it comes naturally but but it

490
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:36,710
doesn't you get better at it but but you still need to make sure that what you're doing is

491
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:41,550
balanced and you get the right sort of input from from others and

492
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:48,989
um i find that speaking to jane about what i'm doing um helps in that way a lot yeah

493
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:55,170
paul been asking these two questions to to all the range of leaders and and uh take as much time with

494
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:01,369
these final two questions but we're obsessed with leadership and and what it looks like and i love

495
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:08,269
hearing your story uh as much as any that have been told but in your my who's been the greatest

496
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,230
leader in your life

497
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:21,500
oh dear uh the greatest leader um i'd probably need to think about that one um are you talking

498
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:32,460
about in in every area of endeavor or are you talking about i mean um i guess uh i i love getting

499
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:39,980
advice from my father when he was around and and um as a young man who probably never thought that

500
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,320
he would succeed i mean you have a lot of people who are who are who are who are who are who are

501
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:50,239
self-doubt when you're younger and quite often that's what drives you i think um but uh my father

502
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,880
would uh always um sort of point me in the right direction i think yeah so he wasn't a leader but

503
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,139
he was my leader yeah and that is a common answer for you'd be people scan and they uh some people

504
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:07,820
go to to great historical you know mandela type leaders who they've read about and have had an

505
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,860
influence on them but those that had a an influential parent often that's where they

506
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,320
start what what sort of

507
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:22,179
dad was he like what sort of influence did he have yeah he was very similar um i mean he um

508
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:32,260
played a few games with melvin i think um he uh was a great tennis player um he was um um a fairly

509
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:40,079
um you know what didn't have a a crazy social life he was a good family man he was always around

510
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,239
um yeah he he was

511
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:43,320
um

512
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:50,019
sensible balanced and um he told me what he was thinking which is probably what i needed as a

513
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:57,699
young man we uh we see collaboration as we said before of being something that uh is really uh

514
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:04,000
been uh beneficial to the way people thinking about leadership now in that spirit if you could

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,119
collaborate with anyone on anything paul and you've got a diverse range of interests in any

516
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,719
part of your life is there is there someone that jumps out at you that you'd like to collaborate

517
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:12,940
with

518
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:22,820
yeah if i if i had a problem or an opportunity of significance i'd probably want to talk to jade

519
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:28,719
about it i think yeah and the two of you together i mean and she's had an extraordinary you know

520
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,619
successful life as an investment banker and you know she's an order of australia alongside you

521
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:38,300
for the work you do together so it's a real partnership and a real collaboration on on

522
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,579
and on all those things or do you have things that you that you sort of separated

523
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,179
oh

524
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:45,380
Oh, no, we don't always agree if that's what you mean.

525
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:53,340
No, but it's probably interesting for you and your listeners to know that Jane was the

526
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,559
banker who floated toll for us back in 93.

527
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,460
Is that how you met?

528
00:43:58,559 --> 00:43:58,800
Yeah.

529
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,639
I didn't know that.

530
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,219
And that's an interesting relationship to them.

531
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah.

532
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,699
And was it an, it was, you know, they're an attraction straight away or?

533
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,639
Oh, you mean to the business or to me?

534
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:21,400
Look, I think when Jane was asked by her sort of a quite a large, well-known global bank

535
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,780
to go out to a place called Brooklyn here in Victoria or in Melbourne, I mean, she knew

536
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,340
where Brooklyn was in the US.

537
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,659
Slightly different than Brooklyn here in the western suburbs of Melbourne.

538
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:38,440
So I think she thought she'd probably made the wrong decision to consider coming back

539
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,619
to Melbourne and working here.

540
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,179
Yeah, for a while.

541
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:51,860
But no, we talk about a lot of things, obviously, and I respect her view, which comes probably

542
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,980
from a different angle in my view with a lot of these things.

543
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,019
So it works well.

544
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:00,460
Paul, I've been looking forward to this conversation and fascinated by the way you've approached

545
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,900
your life.

546
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,980
It's such a unique path that you've taken.

547
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:09,440
And there's so much to learn from your life experience and the way you've gone about approaching

548
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:09,780
everything.

549
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,840

Pleasure.

No, I've loved it.
