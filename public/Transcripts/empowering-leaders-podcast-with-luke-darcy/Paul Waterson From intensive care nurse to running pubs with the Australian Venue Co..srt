1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:16,370
Paul Watterson's life story from intensive care nurse to building and running a number of massive scale businesses in healthcare and now hospitality is a remarkable story to me on every level.

2
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:25,629
His crystal clear thinking and understanding of where opportunities exist is worth listening to and it all started with what was a genuine sliding door moment.

3
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:30,769
One of my mates still takes responsibility for the career trajectory from that moment.

4
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:39,009
I think we'd had one beer at a pub in Kighton and we're heading up to Moama and young Toddy sort of you know straight off the road into a tree.

5
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:44,469
At that time there was just no way you could go back and work along the bedside.

6
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:51,689
Paul shares the great influence his two mentors Bruce Dixon and Vita Pepe had on him and the lessons he still applies today.

7
00:00:51,689 --> 00:01:00,689
The combination of two people makes one outstanding leader and Bruce was sort of the master at seeing strategy, execution.

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:10,250
Kitting on that strategy, delivering organic growth and Vita has just an incredible eye for detail, she's very methodical, she's very driven.

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:23,170
If you're interested in scaling your business or how to grow your world then Paul Watterson's story of buying a single pub for fun to now running a pub group that turns over $1.4 billion in sales a year is worth a listen.

10
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,670
It's always focus on organic growth because clearly that's the most prized growth that you can get in any business.

11
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,670
So if you can deliver organically.

12
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:43,250
Organic growth through that mix of either price or volume depending on the type of business that you're in then you have really built an incredible sort of box or unit in which you can grow value from.

13
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,969
It's been a great privilege for us to have Paul Watterson as part of our Alita Connect community.

14
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:55,810
We are really passionate about this idea of bringing people together from diverse backgrounds and groups of five or six from around the globe to learn, to connect and to share.

15
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,750
Head to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call, we'd love to chat to you and connect with you.

16
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:07,969
Thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and the team from Temper Bedding Australia and their great support of conversations like this one with Paul Watterson.

17
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,050
Temper is a mattress like no other, NASA approved and the world's best in bedding.

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,810
Paul Watterson is the founder, chief executive officer of Australian Venue Co.

19
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:27,870
A venture that started in 2014 with Paul and a few mates bought the station hotel in Footscray because they wanted to have somewhere to drink.

20
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,870
Ten years later they've purchased 160 venues, renovated four of them and built eight new greenfield pubs.

21
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,189
The business generates $1.4 billion in sales and earnings of $250 million.

22
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,169
Paul started his working life as an intensive care nurse before a car accident on a golf trip ended with him breaking his hand.

23
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:54,849
Not able to work in the ICU, he spent a year in the Department of Health and in 2001 Paul joined a business called Healthscope that at the time owned 16 hospitals.

24
00:02:55,449 --> 00:03:03,370
His role was to move around the country and run a hospital in the year after they bought a new one, taking him from Sydney to Canberra to Adelaide and back to Sydney again.

25
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,250
Healthscope was valued at $20 million when he started and ten years later was sold to private equity for $2.7 billion.

26
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:19,110
Paul then joined his two mentors from Healthscope, Bruce Dixon and Vita Pepe, as they partnered with private equity to purchase Spotless Catering in 2012 for $720 million.

27
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:24,189
After a major restructure two years later, Spotless was listed for $1.9 billion.

28
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,349
Success stories everywhere, Paul. It's great to catch up with you. Thanks for joining me.

29
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, thanks Luke. Thanks for having me. I'd love to take responsibility for them, but it's always nice to be here.

30
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,270
Yeah, thanks Luke. Thanks for having me. I'd love to take responsibility for them, but it's always nice to be here.

31
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,349
Yeah, thanks Luke. Thanks for having me. I'd love to take responsibility for them, but it's always nice to be here.

32
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:47,889
I get the feeling your humility is going to limit you from taking too much credit on anything, but for a boy who grew up in Swan Hill, son of parents who were both secondary school teachers, it's an incredible working life. Does it surprise you how it's ended up?

33
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:57,729
I think with this stuff, you never plan it. You take the opportunities as they come up, and I think having the ability to move around as opportunities came up really helped.

34
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,949
So yeah, certainly not something you plan as you take your first step as an 18-year-old nurse.

35
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:16,930
In Melbourne, a genuine sliding door moment, it must have been when you break your hand, you're with your mates on a golf trip, and a car hits a tree, you end up with a broken hand, can't do your job in intensive care, you go into management or in the Department of Health.

36
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:24,589
Were you surprised that your skills translated so well? Suddenly you're running hospitals, pretty complex businesses. What were the skills that helped you do that?

37
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:32,850
We were genuinely surprised, and one of my mates still takes responsibility for the career trajectory from that moment.

38
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:42,009
I think we'd had one beer at a pub in Kighton, and we're heading up to Moama, and this young toddy sort of, you know, straight off the road into a tree.

39
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:47,490
At that time, there was just no way you could go back and work along the bedside.

40
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:57,509
And if that hadn't happened, to be honest, I'd probably still be there today, because I really loved working with a great group of friends at the Royal Melbourne ICU, and it was a genuinely sliding door moment.

41
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,930
I think from there, it had really come to take that opportunity.

42
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,810
to work within the Department of Health, but more broadly, go and work for Healthscope.

43
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:18,350
And I think nursing's a funny career whereby, in a lot of ways back then, and even now, to run a hospital, you had to have a director of nursing.

44
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:26,829
So it meant a lot of people with nursing qualifications could go in and essentially run a small business for the first time, and that's probably where I got my opportunity.

45
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:32,470
So you think if that hadn't happened, you would have been quite happily a career intensive care nurse?

46
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:32,910
You loved it.

47
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,290
I absolutely, yeah, genuinely loved it.

48
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:43,029
It was one of those places you see a lot of tragedy, you see a lot of hope, you deal with a lot of families, but it was a great group of people.

49
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,129
And I probably genuinely do think I'd probably be there today if it hadn't have been for that moment.

50
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,110
Amazing, amazing story.

51
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:58,189
Bruce Dixon, Vita Pepe, if I'm saying that correctly, you worked with at Healthscope and Spotless, and they became great mentors in your words.

52
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,310
What did you learn from them?

53
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,110
Yeah, it's a great example where the conversation.

54
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,629
The combination of two people makes one outstanding leader.

55
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:16,829
And Bruce just had this, and still does, had the foresight to identify an opportunity like private health care was at the moment.

56
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,230
At that time, it was private health cover had just rolled in, that lifetime health cover.

57
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,069
And all of a sudden, the penetration of private health care went through the roof.

58
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:32,350
Bruce was sort of the master seeing strategy, executing on that strategy.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,329
Delivering organic growth.

60
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,509
But he will tell you that, you know, his attention to detail is not that great.

61
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,410
And that's where someone like Vita came in.

62
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:47,050
Now, Vita has been the chief operating officer of those businesses, Healthscope and Spotless.

63
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,550
And Vita has just an incredible eye for detail.

64
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,269
She's very methodical.

65
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,410
She's very driven.

66
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,350
She's very unforgiving of poor performance.

67
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,790
And, you know, her philosophy, you know, we used to say it's the equivalent to Yoda in Star Wars.

68
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,089
You know?

69
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,670
And you don't, you do or you don't do.

70
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,189
There's no try with Vita.

71
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,430
And that really held you accountable as a leader and a young manager.

72
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,689
And that's sort of really defined who I've tried to become today.

73
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:14,829
I love that idea.

74
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,029
You're a visionary person like Bruce who can see things that others can't ahead of time.

75
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:20,230
There's a gift in that, isn't there?

76
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,189
But understanding that I can't succeed on the detail stuff.

77
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,589
Very few people have both, do they?

78
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,910
That they can walk the vision and the detail.

79
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,589
But they must have been harmonious together, that skill set.

80
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,290
Oh, yeah.

81
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,329
Incredibly harmonious.

82
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,889
And I think it's also about identification of what your skill set is and what your weaknesses is

83
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:45,069
and find someone who complements you because very few people are everything to everyone.

84
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:45,970
Yeah, brilliant.

85
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:51,050
And you found those learnings really were something you're able to take and absorb,

86
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,209
the way that they're able to combine seeing an opportunity and then executing it with detail?

87
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,889
Well, in the early stages of my career, I spent most of my time alongside Vita

88
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,189
and just her approach and attention.

89
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,850
Her detail, her reviews of things like profit and loss statements, reviews of cash flow,

90
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,889
reviews of general ledgers, reviews of balance sheet.

91
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,709
It was just such a methodical, detail-orientated approach.

92
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,970
It really became very much built within my DNA.

93
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,370
And then over the journey as I've moved into more CEO-style roles,

94
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,829
that's when you can leverage and learn from some of Bruce's history and just some key lessons

95
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,330
like continually maintaining forward.

96
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,929
Momentum in business, even when things go your way or mistakes get made,

97
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,690
just continually just drive along that pathway to get that more strategic outcome.

98
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,809
It's been so much scale in the organizations that you've worked with all the way through.

99
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,289
You've been out and it looks like scale really quickly.

100
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,669
For people listening, most people want to expand their space, whatever it is.

101
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,429
Have you got a message on how to grow your business?

102
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,070
Yeah, I think it's always focused on organic growth because clearly that's the most prized

103
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,309
growth that you can get in.

104
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,929
Any business.

105
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,730
So if you can deliver organic growth through that mix of either price or volume,

106
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,889
depending on the type of business that you're in,

107
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,529
then you have really built an incredible sort of box or unit in which you can grow value from.

108
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:22,730
Now, moreover to organic growth, that then allows you to do what we would call inorganic growth,

109
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:27,230
which are things like acquisitions or things like adding capacity to an existing venue,

110
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,450
something we would call a brownfield or things like building a new venue from scratch.

111
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:31,929
Yeah.

112
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:37,389
So it's really focusing on what drivers you have within your individual business to really

113
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,690
drive that organic growth.

114
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,570
And then the ability to bolt on other inorganic growth levers really gives you that growth

115
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,250
multiplier.

116
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,870
You know, the organic, it just literally generate more sales by being better at your own existing

117
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,149
business and, or, you know, but now to get more margin out of your prices.

118
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,629
And so that's the sort of, that's where you start before you go to the expansion part.

119
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,629
Yeah, very much so.

120
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,909
And I think if you look at a business like hospitals or pubs, they're very much got a,

121
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,070
a fixed cost base.

122
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,289
So any incremental volume, new customers you can add or price you can take, and obviously

123
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:14,730
that third lever is mixed, how you get say premiumization within your product comes through

124
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,090
at a relatively high gross margin when you've got a big fixed cost base.

125
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,409
So focusing on that then enables you to go to people like investors and say, you've got

126
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,669
this ability to grow within a platform and hopefully they'll fund you to then bolt on

127
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,850
additional platforms so you can get those benefits.

128
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:31,909
Yeah.

129
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:33,309
That's in perpetuity.

130
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,330
Australian Venue Co is such an amazing story.

131
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,429
The local pubs and institution, but you saw a gap that maybe others, you know, didn't.

132
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:45,529
Can you explain why you saw, you just described them being able to add different platforms

133
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,230
to it, but what, what was the gap that you saw?

134
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,669
I think with the pub business, initially, as you said, we went in thinking it'd be nice

135
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,250
to own a pub or two.

136
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,090
And originally it was, uh, we bought some pubs for Bruce's son, Mike, to go in and run.

137
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,370
But once we got in there, we could see.

138
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,789
It was an incredibly fragmented industry within Australia.

139
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:12,269
So there's about 9,500 pubs in Australia and only 11% of them are owned by corporate groups.

140
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,929
And I know you and your family have a strong history in, in a number of venues.

141
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,950
One of ours, Angler's Tavern is a, everyone still thinks it's owned by the Darcy's, which

142
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,490
is good for us.

143
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:30,049
But, but ultimately what we saw in the model was the ability to sort of professionalize

144
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:30,830
and scale.

145
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,129
That model.

146
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:38,049
And I think it was part opportunistic, but it was also partially timing because the technology

147
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:43,470
had evolved so much in the previous 10 years that you could really run a business like

148
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,409
that at scale.

149
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:50,350
And I would imagine 10, 15, 20 years ago, running a pub, running 200 pubs just would

150
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,629
have been a nightmare because cash would have been walking out the door.

151
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,529
You know, the chef would have walked out with a leg of lamb at the end of the night, you

152
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,990
would have lost so much stock.

153
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,289
Now there's controls and systems.

154
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:01,350
Yeah.

155
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,289
In place that enable you to do that in scale that just weren't there 20 years ago.

156
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,669
Yeah.

157
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,809
That is an interesting point I hadn't thought of in your model, isn't it?

158
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,250
That there was a huge amount of leakage out of, uh, the local pub and it was almost accepted

159
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,570
that, you know, your mate behind the bar gave free drinks.

160
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,269
Like my dad would roll in his grave, you know, you don't have a friend at the supermarket

161
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,789
that gives you free groceries, but when we, you know, I can picture dad calling people

162
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,889
out, it's going, that's actually called theft.

163
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,490
We buy that beer, you give it away for free.

164
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,570
That kills us.

165
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,590
We, we go out of business.

166
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,350
But it was just.

167
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,210
It was sort of hospitality jovial thing that went on or you're right, like the chefs had

168
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,289
their side deals with the steaks going to their house and out the back, but in the end

169
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,509
it, it sent a lot of businesses broke.

170
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,570
Yeah, very much so.

171
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:44,850
And it wasn't scalable.

172
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,450
So you've now got systems, for example, that decrement stock.

173
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:53,129
So you know what your theoretical stock take should be at any time based on the products

174
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:53,809
that you're selling.

175
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,929
And if the stock level is different, you know, pretty much on a daily basis, if you've got

176
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,350
an issue.

177
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,090
I think the other thing is cash.

178
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,090
Like we're over 95%.

179
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,929
Is carded or through order at table now says it's just not cash in the business like there

180
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:07,710
was previously.

181
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,090
And that's really helped the ability to scale the model.

182
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,129
And I think the other thing that, that you've seen is just the, the new customer based systems

183
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,649
that, that you can introduce and things like order at table.

184
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,509
You know, we were the first business to introduce order at table QR code.

185
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,730
And some people in the history absolutely hate us for that.

186
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,929
But you go back to 2018, it just didn't exist.

187
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:36,250
And there's space for that sort of technology that you can then use to run your businesses

188
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,570
in slightly different ways.

189
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:44,830
And then finally, the other big enabler that we have now is customer data and using that

190
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,669
customer data to tweak your model and tweak your offering is just something that just

191
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,049
wasn't there 20 years ago.

192
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:56,309
Can you give us an idea of how many people go through, you know, on a weekly or an annual

193
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,190
basis when you've got scale like you have, there must be a big volume of people, a lot

194
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,490
of people.

195
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,110
Eyeballs that comes through your venues.

196
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,470
We have 6 million users in our customer database.

197
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,850
And so when we talk about users, they're customers who transact with them on an annual basis,

198
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,909
maybe multiple times.

199
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:18,590
And that looks at things like what their spend is within venues, what cross sell there is,

200
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,250
i.e. what venues they, multiple venues they go to us.

201
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,070
We can see what their preferences are.

202
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,470
So we can see if you've ordered a kid's meal and we can show you other ones of our pubs

203
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,429
that have kids based.

204
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,429
So there's different ways you can segment that customer base, but it's about 6 million

205
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,710
users that we have in the business at the moment.

206
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,269
And is the buying power scale a profound thing?

207
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,710
Does that help the model as well?

208
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:43,909
Oh, very much so.

209
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,669
I think it's one of those ones where once again, you, you can go to a supplier base

210
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,570
and you can say, you've got this enormously powerful customer group.

211
00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:00,110
And when you want to introduce say new products, we can tell you what, uh, venues will suit

212
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,070
those new products.

213
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,210
And a good example is sort of hard solo or hard rated that came out last year.

214
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,509
That, that was a product that didn't exist two years ago.

215
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,009
It's come in and pretty quickly become probably in the top three or four products sold within

216
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:14,789
most pubs.

217
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,590
So we could really quickly identify who was the likely drinker of hard rated.

218
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,750
And then we can mobilize a product like that almost immediately to sort of match that customer

219
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,149
base.

220
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,629
Yeah.

221
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:29,710
That's fascinating to me that the data that you're able to collect now that wasn't available

222
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,090
in the pub.

223
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,230
I always felt growing up in a family of publicans that the pub was just great part of the local

224
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,950
community and you actually serve people.

225
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,830
And when it was done well, it was a really big part of forming communities.

226
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:45,009
I think it's been misunderstood and lost a little bit in translation.

227
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,250
Have you enjoyed that part of it?

228
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,269
Bringing life back to some of these old venues?

229
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:48,889
Oh yeah.

230
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:49,509
It's incredible.

231
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,169
And I think it's a big part of what we try and do.

232
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,110
I think there's this misconception that a larger group couldn't run pubs.

233
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,690
And we were very careful about our model.

234
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,970
And so much as what we wanted to do is systematize the back of house, but keep the front of house

235
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,570
experience very unique, which is why we've got a range of things like small, uh, what

236
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,789
would have been previously family owned pubs all the way through to nightclubs with totally

237
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,289
different demographics.

238
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:21,429
So, you know, we sort of in, in house refer to it as that sort of reverse mullet style

239
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,009
where you've got, you know, all, all business out the back and party up the front.

240
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,269
So you, you've got to have a unique offering for the customer base.

241
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,990
And then it's about building something that those local customers want.

242
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,070
And Angler's Tavern is a good example of that.

243
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,889
So we obviously rebuilt that post the flood two years ago, but you can do a lot of work

244
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,909
and say, okay, there's a very young family led demographic out there now, which means

245
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,269
you want to install big kids play areas.

246
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:52,250
You want to look at making sure you've got a very broad kids based menu.

247
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,129
You want family based activations.

248
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,629
You need a great sports bar because there's a great sports bar customer out there and

249
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:59,509
you need a big, big.

250
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,090
Out and outdoor style area.

251
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,789
And then in the evenings, it transitions almost to a nightclub on a Saturday night where you've

252
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:11,289
got young, uh, 18 to sort of 30 year olds from that part of Melbourne wanting to come

253
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,769
in and have a big night out.

254
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:17,509
So having to build a venue that meets that whole consumer is, is quite a challenge.

255
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:17,890
Yeah.

256
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,809
And obviously a place I know really well.

257
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,529
And I think, you know, when that's up and running really successfully, a lot of the

258
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:28,589
kids from the inner West, when there wasn't a venue like that had to pour into the city

259
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,650
and there's all the risk.

260
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,349
Of cost.

261
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,769
And then there was a lot of trouble going on in the overcrowding city venue.

262
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:38,549
So to have a local venue closer to home that serves all those purposes, you can go there

263
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,349
with your family and have a meal on the 18 to 30 hours.

264
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,970
They need a place to go and socialize and meet and catch up.

265
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,430
So it's brilliant that you are able to do that.

266
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,450
I want to get back to the spotless example.

267
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,369
You come in that business needed serious restructuring.

268
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,289
800 people get sacked pretty quickly as that, the business got bloated.

269
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,690
How have you found those sort of tough leadership calls to, to make them?

270
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,529
Oh, there.

271
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:05,049
They're the hardest calls that you ever have to make in is downsizing an organization.

272
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,549
And it's something that you only want to do if it's absolutely necessary.

273
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:15,809
You want to really focus on growing your business and maintaining your cost base equivalent

274
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,390
to what your revenue size and scale is.

275
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,269
But occasionally there's businesses that get out of whack and that's either because they

276
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,349
don't grow as quickly as you think they're going to grow or they shrink.

277
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,349
And spotless was one of those businesses.

278
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:34,990
That had lost revenue over the journey, but had maintained its cost base.

279
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,130
And then you come in and you look at what are areas within the business that are not

280
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,849
a hundred percent required for the revenue base you have at the moment.

281
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:51,430
And, and at that example, spotless had a very bloated head office cost base.

282
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,950
And so you really look at what changes you can make that don't impact the end customer

283
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,029
and end consumer.

284
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,430
And unfortunately.

285
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,490
That meant we had to make a huge amount of reductions at the, at the head office level.

286
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,250
And we tried to be very honest, very transparent with teams.

287
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:14,829
You try to be very fair on the affected people, uh, be very generous with payouts, but that

288
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,029
probably would have been, and, and do it very quickly.

289
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:21,049
And that probably would have been the toughest sort of eight weeks professionally that, that

290
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,490
I've ever been involved in.

291
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,430
I, uh, I've got to ask you about a story.

292
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,670
You mentioned mom and dad, uh, fair, but tough country folk described as.

293
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,369
Can you share the story?

294
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,230
Can you share the story of why you no longer eat chicken?

295
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:32,009
Chicken?

296
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:37,690
Well, back growing up in Swan Hill and country, as you know, Luke, you often, uh, eat what

297
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,809
you grow in, in some of those locations.

298
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:44,609
So we'd have the potty cars, we'd have the goats, we'd have the, the chickens.

299
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,710
And, you know, one day, and mom still denies this to this day, I should say, but my brothers

300
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,769
have backed me up on this is that we had a beautiful, uh, chicken meal at the end of

301
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:54,990
it.

302
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,069
I went out to feed my pet chicken who was named Peter Moore at the time after the Collingwood

303
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,650
legend, the great Peter Moore, the great Peter Moore, but Peter Moore wasn't in the

304
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,390
coop anymore.

305
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,529
Peter Moore had just been served up for dinner.

306
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:10,569
And, uh, and so that was sort of put me off chicken for life.

307
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,809
So I'm very firmly a steak man that stayed off chicken forever.

308
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,890
I love the patterns of, of great stories like yours.

309
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,549
And there's the idea that very hard to do what you do without the sense of self-leadership.

310
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:24,769
How do you go about feeling your best to run a team?

311
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:27,230
And the size that you do, what do you, what do you do to fill your cup up?

312
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,630
Yeah, it's a hard subject to talk about self-leadership, isn't it?

313
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,509
Cause it's very, um, subjective.

314
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:39,369
I think having the self-awareness and a model that works for you personally is probably

315
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:40,710
what's most critical.

316
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,910
And I think it's very different for each people.

317
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:50,529
And I think from a home and work life perspective, you're kidding yourself if there's not compromises

318
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,349
both sides.

319
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,750
And I think that's sort of inevitable, but I think it comes.

320
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,630
It comes back to principles about how you run your business and how you run your life.

321
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,569
And that's about capital allocation.

322
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:06,950
You have a defined amount of money to invest, or you have a defined amount of hours in the

323
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,329
day.

324
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:10,990
And you've just got to be very methodical about how you allocate that.

325
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,289
Personally, for me, I like to get into work very early, i.e.

326
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:19,450
6am, but then I like to leave at about 4.30 and spend some time at home in the evenings.

327
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,349
It's a very, it's always a challenge and it's going to have to be something that people

328
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,710
find individually work for.

329
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,670
And I think in the modern workforce, there's no better time to be flexible in terms of

330
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,430
finding a solution that works best for an individual.

331
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,950
And you can get through the door at 4.30 and switch off.

332
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,690
Do you find you got that distance?

333
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:41,430
So you've got it all nailed during the day most of the time?

334
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:46,690
Oh, not really in so much as my son will say I'm on the phone the whole time, but I'm very

335
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,569
much switch on and switch off.

336
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,130
So I take a call, put the phone down and I've switched off again, or pick the phone up,

337
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,450
do an email, put it down.

338
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,450
Everything becomes a bit integrated and melded, but it works for me.

339
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,990
It may not work for everyone else, but I think that's where you've just got to find whatever

340
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,289
model works best for you.

341
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:08,150
Has there been one piece of leadership advice that you pass on most?

342
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,789
From a leadership perspective, there's heaps of them, right?

343
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,069
I don't think there's ever one principle.

344
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,690
There is always lots of little learnings that you take along the journey that you try to

345
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,009
apply to your own learning.

346
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,089
I look at it.

347
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,730
And when you first.

348
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,849
As a sort of young manager, start appearing in places like board meetings.

349
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:36,190
So there's no more intimidating environment than a public company board meeting.

350
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,029
And I look early at the health scope days and we had Ron Evans, a great AFL commissioner

351
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:48,849
who was our deputy chairman at health scope and going in to present to Ron and the board

352
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,490
on the performance of the business you're responsible for is an incredibly intimidating

353
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,089
environment.

354
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:54,210
And.

355
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,809
And Bruce said to me a number of times that when you go into a board meeting, you can

356
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,509
never make your career in a boardroom, but you can certainly stuff it up.

357
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:11,349
So I think you go in and just be very methodical about approach, very, um, consistent, very

358
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,109
measured and very factual.

359
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:18,849
So I think that is probably what's sort of guided my approach, certainly to board meetings.

360
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:23,750
So not trying to oversell or undersell, just stick to this is the.

361
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,009
The facts and be clear and consistent.

362
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:26,309
Is that.

363
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:26,809
Exactly.

364
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,569
You don't want to go, it's not the sort of environment you want to go in there and try

365
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,809
and shoot the lights out because you're likely to spray it, spray it out of bounds on the

366
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:34,210
full.

367
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,609
I love, um, the idea of vision and Australian venue is an amazing vision.

368
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,109
That's really been yours.

369
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,789
And then you go in and run it and then you've got, you know, I'm not sure what the headcount

370
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:45,190
would be.

371
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,710
You'd employ a lot of people now, maybe you can share that with us, but how do you go

372
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,089
about sharing that vision?

373
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:53,049
That's really clear to you with that bigger scope of people.

374
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:53,849
Yeah.

375
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,109
We have.

376
00:23:54,109 --> 00:24:01,490
8,500 people across the 230 venues, which is spread all across Australia and New Zealand.

377
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:06,230
So it really is that mix between spending time on the road.

378
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,450
It sounds ridiculous, but you know, I'm very focused on getting to every venue.

379
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,650
Every year and just spending time inside venues, talking to the teams on the ground,

380
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,569
understanding what their challenges are, and then learning from those and applying those

381
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:23,990
learnings.

382
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:30,769
I think the other strategy that you use is similar, obviously, listen to your podcast

383
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,450
with the CR Bunnings and spoke about their approach with workplace, which we also use

384
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,390
to try and have that top down approach and that interactive approach with the team where

385
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,950
you try and impart where you see vision.

386
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,789
And I think it's in modeling behavior.

387
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,990
I mean, one thing that's very important to myself as a business is how much the customers

388
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,650
enjoy the pubs when they're in them.

389
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,970
And, and you have very.

390
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,930
Very rich information that once again, you probably didn't have 20 years ago.

391
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,569
You look at customer reviews, we get about 120,000 customer reviews across our business

392
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,349
every year.

393
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:09,730
And inevitably some are negative, about 3% of our reviews are negative.

394
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:17,130
So we look at those as a incredible learning opportunity whereby any one or two star review,

395
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,750
we get instantly to our email for myself and the chief operating officer and the chief

396
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,829
marketing officer.

397
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,650
And then.

398
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,390
It's incredible how much little nuggets of gold you get in those that you can use to

399
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,509
sort of drive decision-making, understand if a venue is going off and, but just, and

400
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,589
directly engaging with the teams on the ground to sort of really impart one of those

401
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,509
visions is that customer experience is really critical in our sorts of venues.

402
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:48,549
So it's really a mix of being able to spend time in venues, talking to people and having

403
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,089
that sort of top down approach and trying to just be visible and share.

404
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,529
You're a very humble location.

405
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,769
Be way about you, Paul.

406
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,190
And I've, I've had the pleasure of having a beer with you in one of your venues and

407
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,089
I just watch you sit at the bar, you go up and order.

408
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,369
You often know the person's name, but have you found that valuable?

409
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,069
And it sounds like you like meeting in your venues and, and do they always recognize you

410
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:09,950
or can you fly under the radar?

411
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:15,769
I can very, I can very easily fly under the radar, but, but I do love spending time with

412
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,369
the team in venue.

413
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,490
They're just, as you said, they're just great places.

414
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,089
And I don't think people outside Australia really.

415
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,509
Understand the psyche of the Australian culture and how important pubs are to that

416
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:33,509
Australian culture and just what a critical infrastructure that we have and how lucky

417
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:39,349
are we that we have 9,500 incredible venues, incredible meeting places, places that we

418
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,230
can share with family, share with mates, watch sport.

419
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,970
It's just quite a unique model.

420
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,329
Yeah.

421
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,670
Long may it continue.

422
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,910
It feels like we're losing a few more to apartments a bit more quickly than we would like.

423
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:59,109
The idea of curiosity, we see something really consistent with successful people and leaders

424
00:26:59,109 --> 00:26:59,690
like you.

425
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,089
Do you go down different rabbit holes of curiosity?

426
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,049
Can you share one with us?

427
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:03,569
Oh yeah.

428
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,410
All the time.

429
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:10,069
I think, um, once again, coming from outside the pub industry enables you to come in and

430
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:14,690
sort of ask those stupid questions that you would, wouldn't otherwise normally ask.

431
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,650
And you can ask them with a straight face.

432
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,589
And so you look at things like, you know, why are certain things done a certain way?

433
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:22,769
And you can ask them with a straight face.

434
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:27,109
And you can challenge that sort of status quo and you can introduce new technology.

435
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,329
I spoke about things like order at table.

436
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,049
When we looked at investing in Mr.

437
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,049
Yum, the order at table tool at the time, everyone thought we were ridiculous.

438
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,970
No one would ever order through their phone to get a beer from a bar that was a hundred

439
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,650
meters away.

440
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,589
But now like 25% of our revenue comes through order at table tool.

441
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,049
We're playing with things like AI at the moment where we're looking at things like what do

442
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:52,750
customers want?

443
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,329
Within venues, what learnings can we take and then apply them over multiple venues?

444
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:02,230
We're looking at things like AI for things like labor forecasting, where we can say,

445
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:05,150
okay, we've Collingwood plays Carlton on a Friday night.

446
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,549
There's 90,000 people and the temperature is 13 degrees and it's raining.

447
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,589
How many people do we need to staff the Duke of Wellington before the game?

448
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,690
So it's trying to leverage that technology and using new technology to continually help

449
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,630
improve the business.

450
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,690
I keep thinking of my dad listening to you, Paul, where he would just be a smile from

451
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,529
ear to ear because growing up listening to him, you know, walk into the pub and too

452
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,410
many people on and he was, you know, he was a pretty calm, cool collector, but he hated

453
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,430
it when there was someone had not got the roster to write.

454
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,970
It's both sides too, right?

455
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:41,990
Like you got too many on, but there's nothing worse than when you got a full bar and they're

456
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,390
six deep and you're leaving revenue on the table.

457
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,230
So it goes both ways.

458
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,750
Just as bad.

459
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,349
That's right.

460
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:51,009
Or the new person behind the bar that was spilling the beer and he was just, you know,

461
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,650
that's going down the drain.

462
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,609
I can't believe it, but I love where you're going with AI and collaboration is a huge

463
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,150
part of the world that we're in.

464
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,069
And we've loved having you part of our leader group, Paul.

465
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,670
And I know so many people have enjoyed the wisdom that you've brought to the table, but

466
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,990
this idea that the cost of leadership is time.

467
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,009
And you mentioned a bit of how you struck for your day to still be across eight and

468
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:14,289
a half thousand staff, have your own family life.

469
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,089
How do you find that balance?

470
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:21,569
I think it really comes down to how you allocate your time and allocate your day and just staying

471
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:22,670
really focused on.

472
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:29,390
What adds value, what doesn't add value and try and avoid things that don't add value

473
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,150
to your business.

474
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:36,450
I think very much, um, as a sort of business to consumer business, you've got to be very

475
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,789
focused on the customer and very focused on the team who's delivering that service to

476
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:41,390
the customer.

477
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:46,789
And if you're forever pulling back on what are your key levers and is what you're doing

478
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:52,069
in your business consistent with driving those key levers in our case, organic growth within

479
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:52,569
a business.

480
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,849
Then you can still go down rabbit holes, but pull yourself back out pretty quickly because

481
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,769
you can say, okay, I've spent two hours on this.

482
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:03,089
Is this improving the customer experience in the pubs?

483
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,529
Is it helping the team?

484
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,390
If it's neither of those, you're better off sort of moving on and, and picking something

485
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:08,589
out.

486
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,710
So you end up kissing a lot of frogs and trying different things, but you just got to stay

487
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,309
disciplined to those principles.

488
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:16,190
Do you have a mantra with communication?

489
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,569
I suppose you have to be sophisticated with it.

490
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,990
The scale that you've got now, have you got a system around that?

491
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:22,549
I think it is.

492
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:26,549
It is really about having sort of clear, concise messaging.

493
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:32,470
And I think being conscious of all types of communication, I think people sort of typecast

494
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:38,069
talking as communication, but it's just as important to be really actively listening.

495
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:43,730
So that's where I do have to really pull myself in and say, just put the phone down and concentrate

496
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,809
on the person in front of you.

497
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:46,829
Look at their body language.

498
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:48,309
Look at what they're saying to you.

499
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,230
Look at where the challenges are and try and work through and sort of solve those.

500
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:58,109
And I think the other thing is being very clear and decisive on your messaging.

501
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,869
We've done, there's a lot of studies out there that show when you meet someone new, what

502
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:09,269
you do within that first sort of, you know, 30 seconds to a minute is really important

503
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,930
about getting your message across.

504
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:14,829
So that's the other thing I really try and focus on when I'm in a meeting or meeting

505
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:21,089
someone new for a half an hour or an hour, just go in and really understand what are

506
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,430
the key messages that you've got.

507
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:27,390
Want to get across and do it within the first minute or so, because if you can do that and

508
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,269
you still got their attention, then hopefully something comes from it.

509
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,970
Oh, it's a great, um, why you've described that point.

510
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,450
You're right.

511
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,410
Is it, you almost instantaneously can feel someone's listening to your game and it's

512
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,589
happened to the first 30 seconds.

513
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:41,710
And if they're glancing at their phone or looking over your shoulder, it's almost like

514
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,230
it's done, isn't it?

515
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:44,269
In that time.

516
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,329
I haven't thought of it that way, but you're right, isn't it?

517
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:50,190
If you're not paying attention, it's, it's a waste of everyone's time.

518
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:50,710
It is.

519
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,410
And I think it's one thing, you, you know,

520
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,089
how bad it is when you're talking to someone and they're not concentrating and focusing

521
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:56,589
on you.

522
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:01,329
I have to pull myself up and say, this, this is how you're being perceived by other people.

523
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,569
So put the phone down.

524
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,450
Don't glance at the phone while someone's trying to tell you something.

525
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,109
It's something I've got to work on and stay really focused on.

526
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:08,369
Yeah.

527
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:08,750
Brilliant.

528
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,210
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

529
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:17,009
Oh, well, other than those sort of two mentors, Bruce and Vita, I think family and, and mum

530
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,630
and dad have always been incredibly supportive of myself.

531
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,250
And, and then you look at.

532
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:28,069
You know, who's out there globally, big titans of industries to see who you can learn from

533
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:28,609
as well.

534
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:34,190
But I think really trying to take the best out of Bruce and Vita has probably influenced

535
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,990
me most of all.

536
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,329
What do mum and dad think when they, you know, you sit back, you go back to the farm and

537
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:43,690
you catch up and you're in the old family house you grew up in and do they smile or

538
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,950
do they, are they surprised?

539
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:45,450
What do they think?

540
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,130
Oh yeah.

541
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,829
I think, um, you know, our mums and dads are like, they're surprised with whatever you

542
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,390
do and pleased with whatever.

543
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,769
I'm proud of whatever you do.

544
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:59,130
You know, I was over overseas last week and there was an article in the age about what

545
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,329
was going on in the St. Kilda market and mum rang and said, oh, I saw you in the paper.

546
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:09,609
You know, I think anything that you do is, is a surprise, but you know, they're always

547
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,329
parents always proud, aren't they?

548
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,829
Of whatever you're doing.

549
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:16,890
And they're proud of, uh, my other two brothers and sisters equally.

550
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,329
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration.

551
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,390
As we said, it's been great to have you in our leader connect world and curating those

552
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,369
groups around the globe.

553
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,829
Have you thought of a, you know, you've had reach with a number of different people.

554
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,730
Has there been someone you thought, God, I'd love to connect or collaborate with them in

555
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,390
any of your passions?

556
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,670
I think if you look at who are some of the global leaders out there in our industry,

557
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,089
you can, and part of what we do is go around and see what is trending globally.

558
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,589
What's new food and beverage concepts coming.

559
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:49,170
So going and looking internationally, there's, I was in the States recently looking at businesses

560
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,349
like there's a guy called Danny Meyer who runs a business site, union square.

561
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:57,609
Hospitality and, and that's an incredible food and beverage led business in New York.

562
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,349
He he's an incredible collaborator.

563
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,130
And I think what sort of scales he got out of, well, he, he's got only about 10 venues,

564
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,930
but just the attention to detail in those 10 venues and they're far more restaurant

565
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,690
led venues.

566
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:14,530
It's just great to go in there as a customer and pick up on those interaction points they

567
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,630
have with, with each customer and just really try and learn off those models and apply those

568
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,289
learnings.

569
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:20,469
Yeah.

570
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,889
And I think more broadly.

571
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:29,510
You can look at great investors of, uh, over the journey, people like Charlie Munger, those

572
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,269
sort of guys, you can just learn a lot from listening to people who take what is a relatively

573
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:38,070
complex situation and can just distill it in a very simple way.

574
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,090
And Paul, you seem to be a great sharer.

575
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:46,309
You're an open book, even with other people in the industry, you don't get concerned about,

576
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,989
Hey, this is what we're doing.

577
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,949
This is how we purchase.

578
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,170
And can we help you?

579
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,710
It's a great trade of yours.

580
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:52,309
Is that something?

581
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,590
You've been focused on as well?

582
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:53,869
Was it?

583
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,849
I think Australian hospitality is very unique in its collaboration and cooperation.

584
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:04,110
It's a double-edged sword in that it's not the sort of industry where there's a lot of

585
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,130
publicly available data.

586
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:12,510
So I will often ring mentors and helpers within the industry that says, Oh, our trade is doing

587
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,349
this in Victoria.

588
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:14,409
How's your going?

589
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:19,230
Because ultimately it's one of those industries where the rising tide floats all boats.

590
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,030
And if we have a stronger hospitality industry, generally.

591
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:38,670
I think that's what makes Australian hospitality so unique in that you've got space for that

592
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:45,070
incredible 120 seats, small bar, large restaurants, bigger corporate players like us.

593
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,409
It's a very unique industry that all those groups can coexist and do well and learn from

594
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:50,849
each other.

595
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,269
The intensity.

596
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:56,510
The intensity of CareNurse from Swan Hill turned into one of the great business success

597
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,710
stories is an incredible story to share.

598
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:02,670
I've followed with great interest, Paul, and I love how clear you are and you're thinking.

599
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,309
Awesome to catch up with you today.

600
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:04,929
Thanks for joining me.

601
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,809
