1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,080
What does it take to be the catalyst for a global movement for change?

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,000
And how do you effectively broadcast and communicate your beliefs

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,019
whilst being accepting and open to the opinion of others?

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,660
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

5
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,519
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,280
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,199
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,939
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,100
in education, sport, industry and the arts

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,079
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,539
where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,119
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,670
Peter Singer has been described as the world's most influential living philosopher.

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,629
His book, Animal Liberation, published in 1975,

15
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:13,150
is credited with starting the modern animal rights movement.

16
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,969
Peter's influence and extensive writing on the topic of effective altruism

17
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,530
has led to many of the richest people on the planet committing to donating

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,670
the vast majority...

19
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,409
of their wealth in their lifetime.

20
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,109
He's the founder of The Life You Can Save,

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,290
an organisation based on his book of the same name,

22
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,730
which mounts a very convincing argument that we should all be doing more

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,969
to improve the lives of people living in extreme poverty.

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,790
Peter was born in Melbourne in 1946, educated at Melbourne University

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,189
and Oxford in the UK.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,810
In 1999, Peter became the Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University.

27
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,549
Peter Singer, it's a great honour and a great privilege to meet you.

28
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,750
Thanks for joining me on the podcast.

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,109
You're very welcome, Luke.

30
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,790
And I'm pleased to be able to talk to you.

31
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,829
Peter, I have to say, effective altruism was not a term that I was familiar with

32
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,930
before reading your books and doing some research for today.

33
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,950
Can you explain to those listening to the podcast today what it means

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,629
and why you've had a real passion for expanding that around the world?

35
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,250
Yeah, it's actually a relatively new term.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,469
It's only been going a dozen or so years.

37
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,409
I think most people understand what altruism means.

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,610
That's wanting to help others, wanting to make the world a better place,

39
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,030
not just thinking about yourself.

40
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,789
And that's been an ideal that many people have had and some of them have followed.

41
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:30,469
But they often haven't thought about how to do that most effectively.

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,990
And that's a contrast to a lot of the things that we do.

43
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,509
For example, if we need to buy something, we're often very concerned to look at what's online

44
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,270
to get information about is this going to give me the best value for my money?

45
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,189
Am I paying more for my phone or my new car or whatever else it might be

46
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:51,050
than I really need to to get what I want?

47
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:58,210
But when it comes to doing good, and the most obvious comparison here would be donating to a charity,

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,610
very few people really ask, is this charity going to do the most good with the money

49
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,490
that I'm going to give them as compared with other charities that I might give the same amount to?

50
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,870
And effective altruists got interested in that question and started doing some research

51
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,849
to find out how you can know which charities are doing the most good.

52
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,050
And then they all started looking up.

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,669
But at other things that you might do, apart from donating, like what career you might choose

54
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,330
if you're interested in a career that will help to improve the world,

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,409
and if you're going to volunteer to work for an organization, again, which one should you work for?

56
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,629
There's a whole lot of different things in which ways you can be effective

57
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,169
and try to make the world a better place.

58
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,689
And that's really what the effective altruism movement is all about.

59
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,009
And it's now a worldwide movement with people in many different places in touch

60
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,090
with the world. And that's really what the effective altruism movement is all about.

61
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,330
Having discussions, sharing experiences about how to do the most good most effectively.

62
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:02,349
Peter, you share some stories that I think really cut to the chase of what you're about.

63
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,169
And I wonder if you could retell the story of the two-year-old Wang Yu who was hit by a van

64
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,949
in Southern China. Everyone will be horrified by this story.

65
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,990
But I think then in the context that you explain around just how many children die each year

66
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,089
from preventable disease, can you share that story and then put it into the context of that story?

67
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,850
Yes, this was a tragic incident that happened in the Chinese town of Foshan.

68
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:35,670
And Wang Yu was a little girl about two years old who somehow wandered away from the attention

69
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,810
of her mother. It was a little street full of shops, but there was also some traffic in it.

70
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:50,990
And she wandered out into the street where she did get hit by a van. And while she was lying

71
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,730
there in the street, I think about 17 people walked past her and just kind of averted their

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,750
eyes. They didn't say, why is this little girl lying here? This is dangerous. We should do

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,250
something. They just walked on by. And it wasn't until a cleaner came along and noticed her and

74
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,110
sounded the alarm that help was called. But by that time, she'd actually already been run over

75
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,189
a second time. And by the time she got to hospital, it was too late. She was dead.

76
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,970
Now, that was captured.

77
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,490
It was captured on video because there was a video cam in the street. And when it was shown

78
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,009
on television in China, of course, people were shocked, horrified, as you would be,

79
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:39,589
that these people had just walked on by. And yet I used the incident to suggest to my students

80
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:46,709
that in a somewhat similar way, we're also walking on by when we could help people who

81
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,970
are dying of preventable causes, not in front of us, not on the street.

82
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,629
You know, where we're walking, but in distant countries. But still, we can easily find out

83
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:03,870
about this. We know that they are dying from preventable diseases like malaria, which can

84
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,350
be prevented if they can sleep under bed nets, or from diarrhea, which can be prevented with

85
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,810
simple treatment, or providing safe drinking water and sanitation. So there are things that

86
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,970
we can do at not very much expense to us that can help to save lives. And yet,

87
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:28,069
many of us know this in some dim way, but never act on it. Never think, well, look,

88
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,850
I'm spending money on something I don't really need. And I could save a child's life with it.

89
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,269
You know, a child may be quite similar to this little two-year-old girl. And, you know,

90
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,370
should I do that? That's the question that I use that sad story to raise to get people to think

91
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,509
about. And I think your numbers, Peter, suggest that there's, you know, five and a half million

92
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,730
children under the age of five still dying from preventable disease. As you said, stuff like

93
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,610
malaria, diarrhea, effectively dying of poverty rather than illness. And your book, The Life You

94
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,170
Can Save, How to Do Your Part to End World Poverty, reading it in recent times, it's confronting. And

95
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,870
I think you're right in that way, Peter, because you're left thinking immediately, am I doing

96
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,389
enough to help people less fortunate? Can I do more? Can I ask you that question then? Someone

97
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,269
like me who's lived clearly, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think,

98
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:20,970
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think,

99
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,529
a fortunate life to be in the West and to live in affluence. I think anyone in the West is probably

100
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:32,910
in that category. What level should we be doing to make a difference? Yeah, so in The Life You

101
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,889
Can Save, at the back of the book, I do have a kind of a chart, which is somewhat arbitrary,

102
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:44,110
but I start off low for people who don't have very much to spare. Let's say, this was written

103
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,709
for the US, but it's roughly comparable. I was saying for people earning $40,000 or above,

104
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,970
maybe they could think of a way to save. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

105
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,230
I think about giving 1% of their income to effective charities. And as that amount goes up,

106
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:02,949
let's say you're over $100,000, you might think about 5%. You might go higher than that,

107
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,769
and you might start to do the traditional tithe. In fact, obviously, I know many people at lower

108
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:13,050
incomes who are tithing, who are giving 10% of their income. And if you get really wealthy,

109
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:19,649
then maybe you could give 20% or a third of it. The idea of my scale is I don't want anybody to

110
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:25,829
feel that this is a huge hardship, that this is damaging their lives in a significant way.

111
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:32,850
I want people to realize that without much financial sacrifice, and I would argue with

112
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,929
actually positive benefits in terms of your well-being and your feeling of fulfillment

113
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:44,590
and purpose in your life, people can give enough to make a really big difference in

114
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,610
the lives of others.

115
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,610
Peter, your influence in writing has had a profound impact on the Giving Pledge, which

116
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,250
is, I think in 2019, 204 billionaires and possibly more now across 23 countries had

117
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,370
agreed to give away the vast majority of their wealth in their lifetime.

118
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,450
And these are household names, Warren Buffett, Bill and Melinda Gates, Michael Bloomberg,

119
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,409
Mackenzie Bezos, Carl Icahn, Ray Dalio, and the list goes on and on.

120
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,610
In your mind, are the super wealthy doing enough?

121
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,250
No, I don't think they're doing enough.

122
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,490
I think we ought to praise those who have signed the Giving Pledge and who are acting

123
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,929
on it.

124
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,330
But I think there are many who haven't.

125
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,549
And even for those who have, as you say, to give away half of their wealth before they

126
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,190
die, you know, if they're billionaires, they could give away a lot more than half.

127
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,929
They don't need, you know, 500 million.

128
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,669
They don't need 100 million.

129
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,830
So they could do a lot more.

130
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,029
And some of those, you know, are not giving.

131
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,009
They're not giving in the most effective ways either.

132
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,509
They're giving to buildings, you know, at my own university at Princeton.

133
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,250
You know, there's a huge building program going on because there are wealthy alumni of Princeton

134
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,590
who want buildings with their names on them.

135
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,990
And they're prepared to give for buildings more than they're prepared to give for, say,

136
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,169
scholarships to help needy people study at Princeton.

137
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,769
There are some who do give for that, I should say.

138
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,730
But, you know, that seems worldwide.

139
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:15,169
People were...

140
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,570
People give to art galleries or opera houses that will bear their name when that's not

141
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,889
at all the most effective way of doing good.

142
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,250
What do you say to people who are great contributors in their own community?

143
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,850
They donate generously in their own sphere.

144
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,809
They don't live extravagant lives and, you know, probably live with great values and,

145
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,970
you know, focus on their own community.

146
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,690
I suppose the feeling that they can tangibly do something to assist.

147
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,049
I mean, is that enough?

148
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,970
I mean, do you feel...

149
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,090
Do you feel as though that isn't making a significant enough contribution?

150
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,350
Yeah, I don't feel it's enough.

151
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,409
And, you know, look, I admire people who do something in their own community.

152
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,629
Obviously, many people do nothing either in their own community or elsewhere.

153
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,149
But I think, as you said, you know, pretty much everybody in Australia, not quite everybody,

154
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,970
but most people, probably most people listening to this, are affluent by global standards.

155
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:14,190
And to help others in your own community,

156
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,990
is often not getting the best value for what you're doing.

157
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,009
You know, I don't discourage people from giving in their own community,

158
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,129
but I just think that shouldn't be all that they're doing.

159
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:29,090
They should be thinking about people who are living on less than $2 a day,

160
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,070
which is the World Bank's extreme poverty line.

161
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,049
And the World Bank says there's more than 700 million people living on less than $2 a day.

162
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,370
Now, you know, those people are not in Australia.

163
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,029
Those people are overwhelmingly in low-income countries.

164
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,250
And, you know, relatively modest amounts of money can do a lot for them.

165
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,570
Whereas to help people in Australia, and there are people who need help,

166
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,370
but it's much more expensive because, you know, if you give somebody $1,000,

167
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:04,029
let's say if they're on less than $2 a day, you've more than doubled their annual income.

168
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,090
Nobody in Australia would have their annual income doubled if you gave them $1,000.

169
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,009
In fact, for a lot of people who are in poverty in Australia,

170
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,090
$1,000 wouldn't be...

171
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,049
a really significant difference at all, would be something quite nice.

172
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,509
But it wouldn't enable them, for example, to have the capital to start a small business,

173
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,690
which some people do when they're extremely poor

174
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,789
and they could never accumulate that capital before.

175
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:34,629
Or they can replace their leaky thatched roof with a corrugated iron roof,

176
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,590
which in the long run will save them money because it lasts so much longer than a thatched roof,

177
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,029
and keep themselves and their food supplies dry.

178
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,509
And that can be a life-changing difference.

179
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:45,090
But...

180
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,909
But you can't do that for that kind of money in Australia that you can

181
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,450
when donating to people in low-income countries.

182
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,990
Peter, you raise a point in your book and your writings that many people don't donate

183
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,009
because they think it's a helpless cause, that no progress is being made.

184
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,149
But you give good reason for optimism.

185
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,509
And you mentioned the World Bank just before.

186
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,370
And I suppose it is worth quoting the definition of extreme poverty.

187
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,909
You gave a version of it, not having enough income to meet the basic needs of adequate food,

188
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:18,669
water, shelter, clothing, sanitation, healthcare, and education.

189
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:22,809
But you cite from the World Bank stats that between 1999 and 2015,

190
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,690
more than a billion people lifted themselves out of global poverty,

191
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:33,330
leaving the number that you suggested before, 736 million people living on less than $1.90 a day.

192
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,970
So is that your message that it's not a hopeless cause?

193
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,750
We are actually making progress.

194
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,529
We can make a difference and we need to make a difference.

195
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,330
Yeah, absolutely.

196
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,669
We are making progress all the time.

197
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,730
And reducing the number of people in extreme poverty.

198
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:54,889
And even that figure you quoted, 5.5 million children under five dying each year from poverty-related causes,

199
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,549
has dropped since I quoted that figure.

200
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,950
And just in, I don't know, two or three years, it's down to about pretty close to 5 million now.

201
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,870
So that's another half million lives of young children each year that are being saved by the progress we're making.

202
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,210
So it's certainly not a hopeless cause at all.

203
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,210
It's actually, I think...

204
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:17,629
It's a good long-run investment in reducing poverty.

205
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,509
It contributes, you know, you help some people, they help others.

206
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:23,389
They may be able to start small businesses and employ people.

207
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,850
Despite the fact that the world's population is growing, the number of people in extreme poverty is falling.

208
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,409
The debate around overpopulation comes up in the context of some of your philosophy

209
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:43,450
and people who are, at one end of the scale, suggesting that that is one of the greatest crises that our planet faces,

210
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,629
is that we are going to have too many people.

211
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,669
And population expansion.

212
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:52,029
And at the same time, we're extending life as we all want to and should.

213
00:14:52,590 --> 00:15:00,149
Do you give that any credence at all, that there is some element of natural selection that we can't avoid?

214
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,610
Or should we, as you're suggesting, distribute wealth in a way that saves more lives

215
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,490
and you're not concerned about overpopulation?

216
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,629
Well, I guess the answer is both.

217
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,409
I am concerned about overpopulation.

218
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,409
But I still think we should be helping people.

219
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:20,929
And I think, in fact, if you're really particularly concerned about overpopulation,

220
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:26,509
then helping to educate people, and in particular, helping to educate girls,

221
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,129
is the most effective way of doing that.

222
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,190
And I think that's been shown many times, that the number of years of schooling a girl gets

223
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,370
correlates inversely with the number of children she's likely to have.

224
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,090
So the more years of schooling, the fewer children she's likely to have.

225
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,470
So educating.

226
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:47,509
And empowering women is really important.

227
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,809
Now, you know, population is actually kind of, we're in a two-speed world now.

228
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,809
Because here in Australia, well, our population is growing, but mostly because of immigration.

229
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,129
The natural reproduction rate is below replacement level.

230
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,789
And that's true of Europe in general.

231
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,110
It's even true of the United States, I think, now again, apart from immigration.

232
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:13,350
Whereas some of the poorer parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa,

233
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,649
where population is still growing quite rapidly.

234
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:22,529
But if we can help more people to be educated, and of course, make sure that they have access

235
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,629
to contraception, I think those are effective ways of slowing population growth.

236
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,389
And I think they will be helpful for reducing poverty in those countries as well.

237
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,409
Because obviously, if population is growing very fast, then you have to keep building

238
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,090
more schools and more hospitals and all the other facilities people need.

239
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,250
And that's difficult if you're already quite a poor country.

240
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,730
Peter, your leadership in the space of those living in extreme poverty is without question.

241
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,669
And as we said, it led to extraordinary change.

242
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,269
Also, I think the other part of your life that I think we celebrate is the work you've done for animal rights.

243
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,950
And your book, as we mentioned in the opener, published in 1975, Animal Liberation,

244
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,230
widely considered to have created the modern animal welfare movement.

245
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,230
When you look back over a considerable period of time, did it have the effect that you were,

246
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,269
hoping it was going to have?

247
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,950
Well, not quite.

248
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,309
I mean, at least not in my more optimistic moments.

249
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:22,950
You know, I wasn't quite sure what to think when I published it, because I knew it was

250
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,069
quite a radical idea.

251
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,069
And I realized it was possible it would be laughed at or ignored.

252
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:33,769
But I also thought that the arguments I was putting forward and the facts that I was describing

253
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:38,670
about how animals are treated in factory farms in particular, were quite shocking.

254
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,910
And I hope that people would say, oh, I can't support that.

255
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,069
And I'm going to...

256
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:48,750
stop buying those products, because I don't want to buy products that support such cruel treatment of animals.

257
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,230
And the result, I suppose, was a bit in between those two.

258
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:56,309
It wasn't sort of ignored or ridiculed.

259
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,730
Some people tried to ridicule it at first, but that kind of passed.

260
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:07,410
But, and some people did change their diets and, you know, start working for animal rights organizations.

261
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,210
And it made changes, but not as widespread changes as I would have liked to see.

262
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,230
And so, unfortunately,

263
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,930
the reality is that those factory farms are still there.

264
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,690
They haven't changed really very much.

265
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:24,809
Maybe there's been some little tweaks that reduce some of the worst animal suffering, but they're still extremely bad.

266
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:30,329
And yet most people still buy those animal products and support them.

267
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:37,329
And, you know, at least, as I say, in my more optimistic moments, I hope that that wouldn't happen sort of 50 years later.

268
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,730
It's not quite 50 yet, but it's getting close.

269
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,009
So to that extent, I'm disappointed.

270
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:55,289
Right at the moment, I'm actually working on revising that book and bringing out a completely new edition that will update it and show what is still happening to animals in factory farms, in laboratories and elsewhere.

271
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:11,730
And, Peter, look, sort of shifting back for a moment, I think of the numbers that you put forward in some of your writings of the excess of the West and the Department of Agriculture in the US talk about 30 to 40 percent of the food produced ends up in the trash.

272
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,789
At a cost of about US $161 billion a year were the numbers that I read through your work.

273
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:28,170
And the average American female, for example, has got $600 worth of clothing in their wardrobe that they either haven't ever worn or haven't worn in the last 12 months.

274
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:33,509
So how do we get a handle on we've got extreme excess and we're all guilty of it?

275
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:38,470
Well, maybe not all, but everyone has an element of that in the West and extreme poverty.

276
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,410
How do we bridge that gap?

277
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,670
Have you got enough?

278
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:41,710
Yeah.

279
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:48,690
You know, the problem here is that we're encouraged to buy more and consume more.

280
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,930
That's the advertising that we're surrounded with is always telling us to do that.

281
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,089
And social media often tell us to do that as well.

282
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,089
They encourage us to do what others are doing.

283
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,089
And it's really hard to push back against that.

284
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:11,109
There are people who are trying to push back, obviously, particularly those who are more green and concerned about what consumerism is doing to the planet.

285
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,569
But it's, you know, I've tried.

286
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,589
I've written about this quite a lot.

287
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,210
I've suggested to people of age-old wisdom that happiness doesn't lie in having more material goods.

288
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,589
And there's plenty of modern psychological research that shows that as well.

289
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:34,170
That, you know, buying something new gives you a bit of a fill-up for a while, but it's quite brief.

290
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,569
Whereas knowing that you're doing good things, that you're contributing to making the world a better place,

291
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,049
brings a more...

292
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:41,970
Lasting satisfaction.

293
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,009
So I try to make people aware of that.

294
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:52,690
But I know I'm always pushing uphill because of that barrage of advertising that is pushing people in the opposite direction.

295
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,529
So there'll be people listening to this who, you know, are successful in their own right or good people

296
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:05,049
who generally want to do something that is, as you say, contributing in a meaningful way.

297
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:08,769
And they're probably doing their own way on a day-to-day basis.

298
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,690
But to zoom out a bit further and...

299
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,430
Practically, I mean, you've lived your life like this.

300
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,930
You've just won a prestigious award for your work in philosophy and the prize is a million dollars.

301
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,289
You're heading back to the States tomorrow.

302
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,210
You told me to receive that prize.

303
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,730
And in keeping with your life's work, that will be extended to the charities, one that you formed,

304
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,970
the Life You Can Save and to other effective charities, the most effective charities.

305
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:37,589
So you live and breathe as a vegetarian daily and your family do.

306
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,609
So you've lived and breathed what you've preached.

307
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,210
For people listening...

308
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:46,490
Practically, what can they do from now to enhance their contribution to the world?

309
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,410
And as you said, probably live a happier life on the back of it.

310
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,930
Yeah, and I think what you've just mentioned is really important.

311
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,789
You put your finger on the idea of living in accordance with your values.

312
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:57,930
And so many people don't.

313
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,349
So many people, you know, are a bit uncomfortable with what they're doing.

314
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,589
They say, oh, yeah, I know factory farming is awful.

315
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,210
I really shouldn't be buying this chicken.

316
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,549
But, you know, it's cheap and I like it.

317
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,589
So, you know...

318
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,410
And that produces discomfort.

319
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,369
And then what we were talking about before, about helping people in poverty,

320
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,289
a lot of people know that they should be doing that.

321
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,089
But they don't do it.

322
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,829
I think trying to think about where your values are and then setting some standards.

323
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:33,490
One of my friends, a guy called Charlie Bressler, who helped me in founding the Life You Can Save,

324
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,369
has a background in psychology.

325
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:40,269
And he's impressed by this idea of setting your personal best.

326
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,009
You know, I don't know.

327
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,750
You were playing football.

328
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,150
I don't know whether you had, you know, personal best, how many goals you kicked for a game

329
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,309
or how many meters gained or something of that sort.

330
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,769
I know a lot of people think about that.

331
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,309
But you can think about it in terms of how much am I doing to help the world, you know?

332
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,309
Start giving at a low level.

333
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,230
Can I give more?

334
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:08,849
What am I doing through my lifestyle to not consume wastefully, to not support suffering of animals?

335
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,230
All of those sorts of things are things that you...

336
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,150
You can set goals and then you can try and do better.

337
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,339
Peter, there'll be people listening and, you know, I'll ask this question with, you know,

338
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,339
with the degree of, I suppose, circumspect that I'm intending.

339
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,740
But, I mean, is life still fun, Peter?

340
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,819
I mean, you live such a great contributing life and you do so many brilliant things

341
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,680
and moral compass couldn't be any more on track.

342
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,839
But what's fun?

343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,180
Is there still time?

344
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,160
What do you do for fun?

345
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,279
Well, firstly, you know, I like the things that I...

346
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,720
I do like the things that I do.

347
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:57,420
You know, I'm enjoying talking to you and other people who have good questions about values and ethics.

348
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,579
I enjoy the craft of writing.

349
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,059
That's something that, as I said, I'm working on revising animal liberation.

350
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,339
I like making people aware of the things that they can do, of the life you can save,

351
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,099
which, by the way, I invite your listeners to go to thelifeyoucansave.org.au

352
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,400
and look at the website.

353
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,579
For the best charities.

354
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,839
But, you know, if you really want to be in sort of something that's completely different,

355
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,720
I enjoy hiking and bushwalking.

356
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,640
My wife and I still do quite a bit of that.

357
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,059
And I think we're really lucky in Australia.

358
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:36,259
We have such beautiful natural places and good national parks with tracks that are well laid out.

359
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,460
So that's a wonderful thing to do.

360
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,339
I'm also still surfing, not as much as I used to do when I was a bit younger.

361
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,339
But I go down the coast and...

362
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,559
I catch a few waves when they're not too big or an alley.

363
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,259
And I feel like I can handle them.

364
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,759
And that's great fun being out in the water, too.

365
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,599
It's a really kind of natural activity.

366
00:24:57,819 --> 00:24:59,480
You know, you don't need an engine or anything.

367
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,579
You just paddle yourself around and use the natural energy of the waves.

368
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,079
Well, there's some good natural energy that comes across talking to you, Peter,

369
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,140
and a sense of fulfillment and happiness.

370
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,160
And you can't fake that in any sense.

371
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,880
Peter, I've been asking a range of questions to various leaders,

372
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,400
and I'm fascinated.

373
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,680
I'm fascinated to get your thoughts on this.

374
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,740
As I described in the opener, the world's most influential living philosopher.

375
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:28,259
And we're talking about cues of great leadership across different industries.

376
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:31,119
And yours is such a unique space that you've lived.

377
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,000
So please expand on this as much or as little as you like.

378
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,019
But we see the first dimension of great leadership as being self-leadership.

379
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,259
So when I ask that back to you, what does self-leadership mean to you?

380
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,259
I think it means what we're talking about.

381
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,240
Thinking about your own values, working out what's really important to you,

382
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,119
and then acting on those values, not just making it lip service,

383
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,579
but really trying to shape your life around those values.

384
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,619
I think that's self-leadership.

385
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,619
Because if you don't do that, you're not guiding your own life.

386
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,099
Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living.

387
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,400
And that's an idea that I rather like.

388
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
You know, that you should examine yourself.

389
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,400
How am I living?

390
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,079
You know, am I living in accordance with the values that I really want to live in accordance with?

391
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,940
Yeah, I love that thought of self-reflection, Peter.

392
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:32,880
It's a common trait we see of people who live lives like you and influence others in really positive ways.

393
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,339
They are self-reflective constantly, always updating, as you said,

394
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,619
and reflecting on their values and their impact as well.

395
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,720
And that leads to the second dimension, which is we see leaders now really conscious

396
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,440
about how they positively impact others in their environment.

397
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,220
I mean, you've done that.

398
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,619
On a global scale, you've influenced the wealthiest people on the planet.

399
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:56,859
You've influenced people on how we treat animals and, you know, how we eat and how we consume

400
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:57,819
and how we give back.

401
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,779
I mean, is it something you consciously have thought about, Peter,

402
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,200
that positively impacting others around you?

403
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:06,119
Yeah, well, I'm certainly concerned to impact others.

404
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,319
I mean, I think if you're talking about ethics, that's what I'm trying to do.

405
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,319
I want to impact my students, not to indoctrinate them with my own views,

406
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,400
but to get them to think critically and to learn.

407
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,019
I want them to learn how to discuss issues in a critical and also a civil way.

408
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,420
I think it's unfortunate the extent to which people have got polarized in the last few years.

409
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,299
And I want my students, I tell them at the beginning of the course,

410
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,180
I don't want them to be afraid of controversial, difficult ideas,

411
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,579
and I don't want them to abuse people who disagree with them.

412
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,339
I want them to think about why they disagree and to put forward reasons and arguments for that.

413
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,640
But I do also want to influence people, as we've been talking about,

414
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,099
to think about.

415
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,160
How to be effective altruists, to think about how to live well.

416
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,339
And that's why I co-founded The Life You Can Save

417
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,960
and why we recommend particular charities.

418
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,819
If people go to that website, they can look for the charities

419
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,960
that have been independently assessed as being most effective.

420
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,859
So that's all an attempt to try to guide other people

421
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,819
in living their own lives in a better way that will be better for the world

422
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:13,980
and better for them too.

423
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,279
So, Peter, can I ask you as a follow-up to that, your thoughts,

424
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,059
on the new term of cancel culture?

425
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,680
You're educating students at Princeton on thinking and debating their points of view

426
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,519
and doing it in a meaningful way.

427
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,299
It feels as though, particularly coming out of the last two years,

428
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,859
we've had as much change in the world as we've had in my lifetime, for sure,

429
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,839
and enormous amounts of fairly significant moves from government,

430
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,119
which probably you would think should be debated more than any topic

431
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,220
that we've had in recent times.

432
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,220
But there seems to be this fear to do it.

433
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,079
I mean, what's the anecdote to that?

434
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,299
And are you concerned that we don't seem to have that free debate anymore?

435
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,480
Well, I am concerned that there have been a number of incidents

436
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,900
where people who have tried to promote free discussion and debate

437
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,299
have been in some way, you know, either abused, threatened,

438
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,500
or even dismissed from positions, including university positions,

439
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,400
which I think is particularly shocking given that universities

440
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,339
ought to be exempted.

441
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,019
And that's exactly teaching people how to think for themselves

442
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,579
and not thinking that if you're controversial,

443
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,059
you don't belong at a university.

444
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,819
So I deplore that kind of culture.

445
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,140
And in fact, to try to do something about that,

446
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,240
together with a couple of colleagues,

447
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,759
I've started a journal called the Journal of Controversial Ideas,

448
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,000
which is an open access free journal.

449
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,359
You can just go to journalofcontroversialideas.org.

450
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,640
And actually, at the end of this, well, maybe in two or three days,

451
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,359
we're going to publish.

452
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,140
We're going to publish the second issue.

453
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,680
We had the first issue a while ago.

454
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,539
It's, you know, we have peer-reviewed articles.

455
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,680
We don't publish anything that's just sort of emotional venting.

456
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,579
But we want to provide a forum where people can publish controversial ideas.

457
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,480
And if they don't want to put their name to it,

458
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,640
they can use a pseudonym because we do know,

459
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,740
particularly some junior academics who've really been penalized

460
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,660
in their careers by saying something that was worth saying,

461
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,720
that, you know, whether you agree with it or not,

462
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,019
it was definitely worth putting out there and having it discussed.

463
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,400
But got so much vitriol as a result of that,

464
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,140
that they found it really hard to take

465
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,500
and didn't want to write more on those topics.

466
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,140
So, Pete, in recent times,

467
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,500
we've seen the world's richest man buy Twitter with cash.

468
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,259
And we've seen former presidents banned from that platform,

469
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,740
which some people will argue justifiably for mistruths

470
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,259
and outrageous comments.

471
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
And where do you sit on that?

472
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,099
Where is the line of free speech in social media platforms?

473
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,299
Should people be banned?

474
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,599
I mean, where does that sit?

475
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,640
So, I'm generally a defender of a wide range of freedom of thought

476
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,299
and expression.

477
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,940
As I say, as long as it's people are putting arguments

478
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,720
or providing evidence for their views.

479
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,079
If someone, I'm not a supporter of hate speech.

480
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,160
So, if somebody is just pouring out hatred against any particular group,

481
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,700
whether it's, you know,

482
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,519
whether it's a matter of race or sex or, you know,

483
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,779
religion or whatever else it might be,

484
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,180
I don't think that belongs in the public forum.

485
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,160
And I think it's reasonable for organizations like Twitter or Facebook

486
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,579
to say, no, we're taking that down.

487
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,880
But if somebody, and that would include the former president

488
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,019
of the United States, wants to put reasons up

489
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:44,859
for what they're saying and defend those claims,

490
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,079
I think that they ought to be there.

491
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,420
I think that, you know, ought to be there for other people

492
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,200
to refute and show why they think that that's wrong.

493
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,359
But I do think that censoring people is not the way.

494
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,579
I think the way is to refute positions, to hear them out,

495
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,859
and then to show why they're wrong.

496
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,940
I think we have to try to get back to that idea

497
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,880
that we can have reasoned discussions that can lead us towards the truth.

498
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,799
Yeah, brilliant answer.

499
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,099
And I'm not surprised you've got clear thinking on that particular topic

500
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,859
and every topic, by the way.

501
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:29,240
We see another dimension of the leaders that we have been talking to, Peter,

502
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:32,339
are really clear on how they create and share their vision.

503
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,500
And I look at your life's work.

504
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,779
There's certainly an extensive way that you've gone about it

505
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:42,099
through your books, through your writing, through your TED Talks.

506
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,140
How have you created and shared that vision?

507
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,019
How did you go about it?

508
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,720
Well, it was a very long process.

509
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,079
I think writing was the first thing that I started doing.

510
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,819
I found that I had a bit of a facility for writing.

511
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:59,720
And I always wanted to write not just for the other philosophers,

512
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,400
but for a broader audience because I was working in ethics.

513
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,500
And I thought, this is not just for philosophers.

514
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,559
This is important.

515
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,900
So I started to develop that audience through my writing and obviously,

516
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,299
to some extent, through my teaching.

517
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,700
But, you know, gradually, as my work became better known,

518
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,579
I was able to appear more often in the media.

519
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,460
I also worked with other people and other organizations.

520
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,880
When I came back to Australia, I'd been at Oxford and at New York University.

521
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,299
But then in 75, I came back to La Trobe University in Melbourne

522
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:40,960
and subsequently to Monash.

523
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,700
And I worked with organizations to set up animal liberation support.

524
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,599
And I was a co-founder of what's now Animals Australia,

525
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,339
which is, I think, Australia's major animal advocacy organization.

526
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:00,259
And I'm proud of what they've done and are continuing to do for animals.

527
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,680
So I've worked through a range of voluntary organizations.

528
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,179
And then, of course, as we've talked about, through the life you can save.

529
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,079
And I've tried to make my work available as widely as possible.

530
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,820
As I said, the Journal of Controversial Ideas is free and open access.

531
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,400
So the book, The Life You Can Save, is available free as an e-book

532
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,460
or an audio book from thelifeyoucansave.org.au.

533
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,579
So if people want to read a little more, all they have to do is go there.

534
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,880
And that's really what I'm trying to do, get those ideas out as widely as possible.

535
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:37,039
Sincerely encourage you to do that.

536
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,460
I have just done in the last couple of weeks.

537
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,659
And as I said, I think in one of the questions before, I found it confronting.

538
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,320
I found it challenging in a good way in wanting to do more,

539
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,719
wanting to contribute more and really challenging your thought process on Peter's writing,

540
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,019
does that in a really interesting way.

541
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,360
We see great leaders, curiosity is a common trait.

542
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,059
And through curiosity, a lot of modern leaders approach their learning and development through that.

543
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,840
Does that ring true to you?

544
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,579
Yes, I definitely think curiosity is important.

545
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,599
And if people think that they already know everything about something

546
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,920
and are not curious to find out more,

547
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,960
or perhaps,

548
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,199
curious to find out why other people don't think the way they do.

549
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,159
That's an important kind of curiosity,

550
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,519
because then you understand the reasons why people don't think that.

551
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,480
And maybe, maybe you learn that there are some weaknesses in your position,

552
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,159
or maybe you learn that there are some misunderstandings that other people have out there about your position.

553
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,039
But if you want other people to share your views,

554
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,519
you have to see where they're coming from.

555
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,000
And that takes a certain amount of curiosity,

556
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,239
which I think will always help you to clarify and strengthen your own views.

557
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,400
Peter, communicating with clarity is a further dimension we've been talking about.

558
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,440
And you've got a really distinct writing style and a very clear way of getting your message across.

559
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,920
Is that something that you've curated and you've thought about how you communicate with clarity on the messages that you've got?

560
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes, it certainly doesn't come automatically.

561
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,480
You have to work at it.

562
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,360
I think writing is something that you work at.

563
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,000
If I go back,

564
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,199
the first lengthy piece of work that I wrote was

565
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,320
my MA thesis that I did at Melbourne University Master of Arts in philosophy.

566
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,880
And if I go back and read that now,

567
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,000
it's not very well written.

568
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,840
And it is, I guess, written more for the other philosophers.

569
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,079
And then I think, you know, if I look at my further writing,

570
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,039
I do make gradual improvements and being at Oxford certainly helped.

571
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,000
I had a professor there, R.M.

572
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,079
Hare, who actually emphasised clarity of thinking.

573
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,000
And the method of teaching at Oxford was you would write

574
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,639
an essay and drop it into your professor's mailbox.

575
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,719
And two or three days later, you would talk to him about it and he would go through it line by line.

576
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,760
And if he didn't understand what you were saying,

577
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,960
he would tell you, you know, what does this sentence mean?

578
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,519
What are you saying here?

579
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,480
And that's a really good discipline, I think, to make sure that what you're saying,

580
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,599
you know, you may know what you were trying to say in this sentence,

581
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,119
but if the sentence doesn't convey that to someone else who's reading it, that's your problem.

582
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,239
It's not necessarily their problem.

583
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,079
It's your problem.

584
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,679
It's your problem for not having expressed yourself sufficiently clearly.

585
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,079
Great one-on-one teaching, isn't it?

586
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,239
To have that access to, you know.

587
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,000
That was fantastic.

588
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,559
Yeah, that was a great experience.

589
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,880
And that quicker turnaround, isn't it?

590
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,639
To drop something in and literally go line by line with an expert in communication.

591
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,280
I love what you're able to experience there.

592
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,800
Well, you see great leaders really value collaboration more than ever, Peter.

593
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,880
How important is collaboration to you?

594
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,119
Oh, it's hugely important.

595
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,119
You know, you could not have done a lot of the things that I have done

596
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,320
on my own.

597
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,000
As I mentioned, the life you can save was really set up when, you know, I wrote the book

598
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,039
and I established a website or I got a friend to establish a website

599
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,480
so that people could, you know, talk to each other a bit.

600
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,519
But there wasn't really an organization until this guy, Charlie Bresler,

601
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:10,840
sent me an email saying that he'd been, he'd had a career in the retail industry,

602
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,719
in a men's clothing chain.

603
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,920
And he got very senior in that.

604
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,960
And made quite a bit of money.

605
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,239
But it had never really fitted in with his values.

606
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:25,079
It's another question of this dissonance between values and what he was doing.

607
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,199
And he thought, you know, it was time for a change.

608
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,920
And he sort of asked me, would you like me to set up an organization that promotes these

609
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,400
ideas?

610
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,599
And so I said, yeah, let's do it together.

611
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,679
And with that, and without his hard work and experience in organization, because he'd been

612
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,199
running a big organization.

613
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
That would never have happened.

614
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,159
So being able to collaborate and work together with other people who share your goals is really important.

615
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,619
Yeah, great answer, Peter.

616
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,340
It's a great story that, isn't it?

617
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,539
And I'll give all those details very shortly for you to go and look up.

618
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:04,400
We've been asking these final two questions, Peter, to all the leaders that I've spoken to.

619
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,139
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

620
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,380
The greatest leader in my life?

621
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,619
Oh, I don't really know.

622
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:14,760
But I have to say, you know, this is maybe.

623
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,280
I'm not the greatest leader over my life.

624
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,980
But at the moment, I'm really admiring President Zelensky of Ukraine.

625
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,099
I think he's quite extraordinary, you know, especially if you look at the background.

626
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:30,960
I was following Ukrainian politics earlier on and the corrupt people that they had running

627
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,639
that country who, you know, were just ripping off the country, making money for themselves.

628
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,199
And then when there was a big protest, they fled the country.

629
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,139
The previous ones are still in Russia.

630
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,800
And a lot of people expected.

631
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,460
When the Russians invaded, that he would leave Kyiv and, you know, either go to Lviv,

632
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:54,079
which is more in the West and away from the Russians or actually leave the country altogether.

633
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,260
But instead, he stayed and he took all these videos showing himself walking around the main squares of the town.

634
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,320
And he got everybody else to stay.

635
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:05,179
I think he's been a fantastic leader for Ukraine.

636
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Obviously, you could say the country has paid a heavy price for it.

637
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:14,300
But there wasn't really an alternative unless they wanted to be under Putin's thumb.

638
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,000
And so that's what comes to me at the moment when you ask that question, rather than thinking back over the years.

639
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,659
I'm thinking about Zelensky.

640
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,179
What a brilliant answer.

641
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:32,400
And what an extraordinary leader of the time, as you said, the courage to not only stay,

642
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,159
but as you said, to really in real time declare where he is and show that, you know,

643
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,380
he was being portrayed as a former actor and a comedian and, you know, almost trying to picture him.

644
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,059
He's sort of a clown president, but he's been anything apart from courageous and admirable, hasn't he?

645
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:55,659
Under that sort of pressure, it's been amazing to watch that in real time, for sure.

646
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:02,579
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, Peter, on anything, is there anyone that springs to mind?

647
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:08,199
And clearly, you've got these identifiable passions of your life, but it could be in any other area.

648
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,139
Is there anyone that you can think of?

649
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,579
Well, there's a lot of very smart people doing important things.

650
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,940
I think one of the important issues is artificial intelligence and where that's going.

651
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,800
So there are some smart people working for organizations like DeepMind.

652
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:35,139
I've had a little bit of contact with some of them because I'm interested in some of the ethical questions about AI and where it's going.

653
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:44,659
So, you know, that would be an interesting opportunity to work with them and trying to make sure that AI is used for good.

654
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,219
As it certainly has the potential to be, rather than for evil.

655
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:52,139
I'll have to follow up on that, just off the top.

656
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,300
What are the obvious concerns with artificial intelligence?

657
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,179
How damaging could it be if it is not used for good?

658
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:08,739
Well, the overarching one that people are worried about is that as it gets better and as it becomes really artificial general intelligence,

659
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:13,039
so it's not just beating us a chess, but it's good in general,

660
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:14,780
that if it's not aligned with AI, it's not going to be used for good.

661
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,460
If it's not aligned with our values, we might not be able to stop it.

662
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,659
This is something that some of the people in the effective altruism movement have thought about,

663
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,400
people like Nick Bostrom and Will McCaskill, that we need to, they call it value alignment.

664
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,400
We need to align artificial intelligence with our values and make sure that it stays aligned.

665
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:39,400
But even that's not quite enough because when you say our values, then of course there's the question, which values?

666
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:42,460
And certainly in the area of the treatment of animals,

667
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,780
I think the value of AI is not going to be aligned with our values.

668
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,360
The values that most people have are not good enough.

669
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,139
I don't want AI aligned with the way we treat animals now.

670
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,699
I want it aligned with the best values to produce alternatives to the way we're treating animals.

671
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,320
So there are, you know, that's just a couple of issues.

672
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,460
Clearly there's many other issues as well about discrimination within humans,

673
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:08,280
about the use of AI for surveillance, which can be put to negative uses.

674
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:10,800
So there's a huge range of questions.

675
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:14,659
Peter, reading your works in preparation and meeting you,

676
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,039
today, the overwhelming sense is that I want to do better.

677
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,159
You want to contribute more.

678
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,179
You want to live up to the best possible standard you can.

679
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:25,340
It's a profound influence you have, I think,

680
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,860
on anyone who's going to take the time, hopefully, to listen to Peter today.

681
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,199
But I encourage you to go to petersinger.info, Peter's website,

682
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,639
and that leads you into the projects like The Life You Can Save

683
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,800
and recommendations on the most effective charities.

684
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,699
You can understand more about the effective altruism movement through Peter's website,

685
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,179
petersinger.info.

686
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,519
is the website to go to.

687
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:47,440
It's a brilliant resource.

688
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,840
I guarantee it will challenge the way you think,

689
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:51,860
and I hope the way that we all act.

690
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:54,619
And, Peter, it's been a great honour and a great privilege

691
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:56,039
to spend some time with you today.

692
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:57,500
Thanks for sharing your wisdom.

693
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,780
Thanks for your questions, Luke,

694
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,920
and it's great to have the opportunity to connect with the people

695
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
who are listening to you.

696
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,110
Empowering Leaders was presented by me, Luke Darcy,

697
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,429

698
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,210
To start your leadership journey,

699
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,750
I encourage you to go to
