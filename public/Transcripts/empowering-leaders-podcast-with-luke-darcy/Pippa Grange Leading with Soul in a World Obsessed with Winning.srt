1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,339
For me, vulnerability is really close to honesty.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,839
What am I prepared to share with the world about who I am?

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,300
And Renee talks about this a lot.

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,740
It doesn't mean full exposure because, you know,

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,500
you need to also feel safe enough to be vulnerable.

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,460
But if you can be honest about where you're at, you can adapt.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,539
And when we're not vulnerable, it's because we're unwilling to do that.

8
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,640
And that means that we have a boundary up somewhere.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,520
We're afraid of something and that results in conformity.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,640
Yes, people, everything being a little bit less diverse,

11
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,820
a little bit more homogenous.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,060
And to me, that means you won't go quite as far

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,159
as you possibly could to your own edge.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,079
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,820
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,700
and creating a world of collaboration.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,539
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,479
from diverse backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,140
and the arts who come together to learn, to connect, and to collaborate.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,480
Kirsten King, founder of Fluidform Pilates.

21
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,819
It's been amazing.

22
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:14,019
Here you are on this Zoom call, feeling within the first session

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,900
like you intimately know these people and care for them.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,700
And then all of a sudden realising that even though you're

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,200
in totally different industries, we're all going through the same thing

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,180
or we've been through it and we can help each other

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,560
or there's just this hurdle that you can't,

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,299
you can't see past and then you share it with the group

29
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,340
and there's five answers in 40 minutes and you think,

30
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,819
I have not slept for two weeks thinking about that.

31
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,540
Like, how is this possible?

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,939
Craig McRae, senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club.

33
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,359
You're listening to stories and the breadcrumbs of what makes success

34
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,239
and I constantly get something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,939
because we're all living the same stuff, aren't we?

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,340
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,040
What happens there is magical.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,359
The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly brought to you

39

so we can reach more listeners and empower more leaders.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
Today we have an incredible guest,

51
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,900
someone who has transformed the way elite athletes, leaders

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,560
and organisations think about performance, fear and human connection.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,520
Dr Pippa Grange is a psychologist, author and culture coach

54
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,879
best known for her groundbreaking work with England's national football team,

55
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,280
helping them to shift their mindset from fear-driven performance

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,479
to true psychological freedom.

57
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,439
Pippa's career began in Australia, where she worked extensively

58
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,000
in sports psychology, advising many AFL teams

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,860
and other elite sporting organisations before taking on the role

60
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,919
of head of people and team development at England's football association,

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,379
the oldest football association in the world.

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,280
It was there that she played a pivotal role in transforming

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,900
England's national football team, shifting their focus

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,919
from external pressures to a more connected, fearless mindset,

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,460
one that helped drive the historic success at the 2018 World Cup.

66
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,319
Pippa's impact on the sport has been a key part of her career.

67
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:29,439
She's been a part of the sport since she was a kid.

68
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:29,460
She's been a part of the sport since she was a kid.

69
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,800
Pippa's impact on the English team was so great,

70
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,379
it's now being portrayed across the UK in the critically acclaimed

71
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,800
Dear England, an award-winning play about the journey

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,039
to reshape English football.

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,020
Beyond sport, Pippa's influence extends into leadership

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,819
and culture building.

75
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,900
She's often been compared to thought leader, BrenÃ© Brown,

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,199
someone she personally admires and has collaborated with

77
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,699
in conversations around vulnerability, belonging

78
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,979
and courageous leadership.

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,060
Pippa's book, Fearless, How to Win at Life Without Losing Yourself,

80
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,879
challenges traditional ideas of success and offers

81
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,439
a more human-centred approach to high-performance football.

82
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,199
Pippa Grange is helping us all to understand the impact

83
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,699
of fear on performance and the pitfalls of operating

84
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,740
with clenched fists rather than an open heart.

85
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,139
Pippa, it was a big introduction, but it's been a big life.

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,939
Nice to see you again.

87
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,979
It was nice to see you too, Luke.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,340
Thank you.

89
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,659
I need to get that bio off you.

90
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,579
That was pretty impressive.

91
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,420
Thank you.

92
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,579
It's an impressive CV and a body of work that you've done

93
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,259
and you've had a huge influence on so many people.

94
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,860
How do you reflect on what you've been able to achieve?

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,079
You know, it's really interesting hearing somebody,

96
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,040
describe it like that.

97
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,139
For me, to be a psychologist, to be even an author

98
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,180
and a culture coach is to be in the background

99
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,939
and being in the background and really enabling other people

100
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,500
is where I feel best and where I really value the work

101
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,459
that gets done, not just me doing it,

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,040
but all the work that gets done in this way.

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,300
So I listen to it and I reflect on it and I'm humbled

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,759
and privileged.

105
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,839
But, you know, I always have a slight sort of unease

106
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,759
about being centred rather than being on the side

107
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,980
because I like being on the side.

108
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,819
Well, it's nice to put you right front and centre

109
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,079
for this conversation.

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,839
You're a brilliant author amongst all the other achievements

111
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,620
and your book, Fearless, has shown a whole generation

112
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,800
of people how to start living their life with less fear

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,879
and you find, you know, the real passions are deep

114
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,000
and fulfilment you talk about a lot in the book.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,740
Can you share about some of the challenges that you share,

116
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,759
in the book, about growing up in a council estate in Yorkshire

117
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,620
and you tragically lost a brother to suicide?

118
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,000
Has it been a really personal thing for you trying

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,259
to teach the world about living with less fear?

120
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,220
You know, I think when you're a psychologist or when you're

121
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,740
a leader of any kind, actually, and you are trying

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,980
to help others, you're always working through yourself

123
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,040
and I think anybody who imagines that they can do this kind

124
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,959
of work without really understanding

125
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,519
where they're at and what happened for them

126
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,079
and how that becomes part of it.

127
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,319
So, yeah, absolutely it influenced the way I see

128
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,439
and the things I care about in a number of ways,

129
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,399
not just in terms of method and context and what I think works,

130
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,439
but also because it's personal.

131
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,879
So, you know, when I write about fear, it's personal.

132
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,699
When I write about trauma, it's personal.

133
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,480
When I write about performing from a more whole place,

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,939
which I'm writing about now, it's personal.

135
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:28,600
And it's sort of the job is to kind of,

136
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,459
like, get rid of the things that might get in the way

137
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,899
that have come from your own life and use them as context

138
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,199
so that you can help other people.

139
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,660
And I think that's the journey, but there's no way you have

140
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,019
any kind of life that's got any kind of adventure in it,

141
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,100
so to speak, that means that you can put that to the side

142
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,819
and compartmentalise and be some kind of separate expert.

143
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,500
You have to integrate both.

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Pippa, I want to talk about your work

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,439
with the England National Soccer Team,

146
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,620
and it seems to me, as an outsider,

147
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,319
that almost the whole UK take their own sense of self-worth

148
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,279
based on the success or otherwise of the England National Team.

149
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,779
And then you come in as the culture coach

150
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,019
and solve that issue for a nation, if you like.

151
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,180
You can't get a bigger job in your world.

152
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,199
Can you share some of the practical ways

153
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,480
that you work with players under that extreme pressure

154
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,819
that they're under in that environment?

155
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,699
What are some practical things you do?

156
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,220
Mostly, Luke, it is actually not working directly with the players.

157
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,360
Yeah.

158
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,420
Yeah.

159
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,439
I think one of the things that you can do

160
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,439
when you're working with players, or not first,

161
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,439
is working with the leaders, the coaches,

162
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,439
the leaders that are surrounding the players.

163
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,939
Because especially in an international context,

164
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,000
the time that you have one-on-one with players is very minimal.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,220
They're at their clubs and they come into camp,

166
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,759
and you might have them for a fifth of the year

167
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,879
if you're really lucky, depending on the tournament cycle.

168
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,399
That's really not long to start learning stuff.

169
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,360
So mostly you're editing and helping them adapt,

170
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
for the players directly.

171
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
And the deeper work is with coaches.

172
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
So that starts with real conversations with coaches,

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
especially around fear.

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,360
It starts with assessing what am I seeing in the culture?

175
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
What's not being talked about?

176
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Where are the cringes and the points of avoidance

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
and what I call the ghosts in the walls?

178
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
If people were listening,

179
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
what would the ghosts be whispering about that nobody's saying?

180
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
And that's exactly what I want to go for when I come

181
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,279
into an organisation to say, what is it that we're doing?

182
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,279
What is it that we really need to be able to be more real

183
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,279
and more whole and more able to be free when you're putting

184
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,279
on a tournament or you have a big event?

185
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
And a lot of time that's emotional stuff

186
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,279
or psychological stuff like fear.

187
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,279
And then the work with players is secondary to that.

188
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,279
I think some of the most important work in England

189
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,279
or New Zealand Rugby League and different organisations

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,279
that I've worked with was helping the frontline leaders be really good

191
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,279
at seeing what they needed to do to help the psychology of the team.

192
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
And I'm not a big fan of the sort of wheeling guru

193
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
because I think it's really temporary.

194
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
Great information gets passed.

195
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,279
Maybe some things stick.

196
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,279
But if you don't actually have the deep time with the players,

197
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,279
you have to have a different method.

198
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,279
And for me, I call that working through,

199
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,279
which is I'm going to identify who is in authority in that organisation.

200
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
And that doesn't necessarily mean top dog, boss.

201
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,279
It means where's the power?

202
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,279
So sometimes that's a particular player.

203
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,279
Sometimes that's a particular coach or a physio or somebody else.

204
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,279
And if I'm working in a non-sport organisation,

205
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,279
it's the same thing.

206
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,279
In a group there's always a couple of people who are very influential

207
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,279
and I'm going to work with them and on them around helping them be amazing

208
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,279
and creating the sort of culture that lets people come alive

209
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,279
and really go to their own edge.

210
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,279
And on that note, Pippa, your influence suggests that if you get

211
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,279
to the key influences,

212
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,279
they can have that trickle-down effect on the rest of the organisation

213
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,279
or the rest of the team.

214
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,279
Absolutely.

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,279
Absolutely, yeah.

216
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,279
Culture is something that's made by what you resist and what you reward.

217
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,279
And that has to come in all sorts of different forms and different methods.

218
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,279
So the way that things get done like feedback gets given or a meeting gets run

219
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,279
or processes and practices come into play, they're all absolute culture builders

220
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,279
and that's not stuff that the players do or the workforce do generally.

221
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,279
That generally comes cascade, trickle-down and that's why I think it's really,

222
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,279
really important to build culture from the start with the top

223
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,279
and then come ground up.

224
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,279
Start with the top in terms of what practices, processes,

225
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
systems are in place and how things get done.

226
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,279
You've worked with elite leaders and CEOs and elite organisations around the globe.

227
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,279
Are there some common traits that you see that see people live the happiest

228
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,279
and most fulfilled lives?

229
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,279
That you talk about in your book?

230
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,279
Is there some patterns that you can see?

231
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
Most definitely.

232
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,279
I think the number one thing for me is seeing, understanding

233
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,279
and addressing not good enough fear.

234
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,279
So it doesn't matter how accomplished you are in your career,

235
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
how far you've got, almost all of us have some not good enough fear kicking

236
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,279
around in the back, you know, and being able to really address that

237
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,279
and unravel that I think is essential for leaders.

238
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,279
The Fearless book is one of them.

239
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,279
It's all about that.

240
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
How do you get at that?

241
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,279
But I think connected to that is we talk a lot in leadership terms

242
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,279
about authenticity, right, like show up authentically.

243
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,279
But sometimes I think that that is just another role people play, you know,

244
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,279
and unless they really go there, unless they're really willing

245
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,279
and safe enough to go there themselves as leaders and start to understand

246
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,279
what's in their way, what do they want to avoid, what's the thing that they dread,

247
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,279
or fear most, or the relationship that's most tense for them

248
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,279
that they don't want to face into?

249
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,279
Because sometimes they are the things that unlock the freedom.

250
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,279
And so, you know, really, really mapping out where are the things

251
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,279
that you identify, if I were working with you, you know,

252
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,279
what are the things that you really think are your own blocks?

253
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,279
Because as soon as you see them and admit them or face them,

254
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
then we can get to work.

255
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
And that's so often there.

256
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,279
Small things are massive unlocks for psychological freedom.

257
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,279
I love that term you used, that not good enough fear that we've all got

258
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,279
within ourselves, and it plays out in you.

259
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,279
And then you moved into that idea that we're playing this role all the time

260
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,279
and how draining that is to show up at the school pick-up and want

261
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,279
to look a certain way so the other parents view you the way you want

262
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,279
or it's pretending all the time to be something so that we're so concerned

263
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
about what other people think.

264
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
And that's the fear you're talking about.

265
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,279
Not the fear of a burglar bursting into your house.

266
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,279
Yeah, exactly.

267
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
The moment fear versus the not good enough fear.

268
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,279
That's right.

269
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,279
And you're saying getting a handle on that and not the fake pretending

270
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,279
authentic but really being close as you can to who you really are.

271
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,279
Is that where you see freedom?

272
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,279
Is that how you describe it?

273
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,279
Yeah, that's exactly it.

274
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,279
And I don't think that most people fake on purpose.

275
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,279
You know, we need an in-between word between sort of honest and fake

276
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,279
because it's not sort of an intentional pretext.

277
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,279
But we just all are so acculturated into presenting ourselves

278
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,279
in particular ways and so acculturated into sort of this idea of needing

279
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,279
to look successful, whether that's as a parent or a professional

280
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,279
in any sort of way.

281
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,279
And really looking at where you think the gaps are.

282
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,279
Sometimes what you might need to let go of is as important as what you might

283
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,279
need to grow or build or change.

284
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,279
Yeah.

285
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,279
But unless you can see it yourself and identify it yourself,

286
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
it's really hard to show up real.

287
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,279
The show up real might be, you know, okay, I'm not going to look perfect today.

288
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,279
I'm not going to sound perfect today.

289
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,279
I don't know all the answers.

290
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,279
I'm running late.

291
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,279
I'm frazzled.

292
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,279
I'm in a caffeinated haze.

293
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,279
Whatever it is for you on that day, you know, you're allowed to be you.

294
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,279
And I think when we can really do that, we unravel some of that perfectionism

295
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,279
that is so prevalent.

296
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,279
And I think that's just something that we need to do

297
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,279
in people and especially in leaders.

298
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,279
Sometimes we think the further up the pecking order you get,

299
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,279
the easier that is, it's not true.

300
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,279
Actually, sometimes it amplifies as you're more visible to people,

301
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
you have more accountability, more responsibility.

302
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,279
So I just think it's something that we actually need

303
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,279
to intentionally cultivate.

304
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,279
We're living in this hyper-competitive world,

305
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
and we compete often, sometimes, unknownly against people

306
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:58,080
shallow versus winning deep. Can you share what that means to you? Yeah. So when I talk about

307
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,019
winning shallow is the kind of winning that may look great on the scoreboard, so to speak,

308
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,320
whatever that is for you. But it's driven by a scarcity mindset. It's winning so that you don't

309
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,039
fail. It's running towards success because you're afraid of what's chasing you rather than winning

310
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:24,539
deep, which is much more about what's possible here. Where's my potential? What might happen?

311
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:32,480
It's much more open. It's got a lot more freedom in it. And winning deep is associated with really,

312
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,980
really sort of deep-rooted meaning for the person. And I think sometimes we talk about purpose,

313
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,100
and obviously that's really important, but it's so much more subtle and nuanced than that. It's

314
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,019
like, you know, when you've had a deep win and you know, when you've had a shallow win,

315
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,320
I can't tell you how many athletes I've worked with that have had the big win.

316
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,419
And really what they feel immediately afterwards is relief, which is understandable. But then a

317
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:06,139
day or two later, they're thinking about the next win. They actually can't leave any space to

318
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:13,039
celebrate themselves or the achievement. Nothing's ever quite enough. And that's shallow winning.

319
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,960
It never compounds. You're just always chasing. And that is really,

320
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,179
really unfulfilling, actually. It's not nearly as, whether you've got the medal around your neck

321
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:27,720
or not, it's not really nearly as good as people think it is. And winning deep is where there's

322
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,659
been all the same blood, sweat, and tears in it, but there was something more that you were doing

323
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:39,840
it for and something that you trusted in yourself, in others, something you let go to, something you

324
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,679
took risks on that felt real. And it's not driven by scarcity. It's driven by possibility.

325
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,919
ISKRA When I was reading,

326
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:54,700
in your book, I thought of the Michael Jordan documentary, The Last Dance. And I'm conflicted

327
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,720
over it because it looks, I'm assuming you've seen it, most of the world has. There appears

328
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,500
to be a body count of people that won championships that seem incredibly unfulfilled and don't look

329
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,599
back with any joy at all at that. And then you've got the six-time champion, maybe the greatest

330
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,900
athlete that's ever lived. And it was part of me to think, God, I'd love to have been on that team.

331
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,460
Regardless of how brutal it was, get me on that team. So I don't know, do you see that as winning

332
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,980
shallow or winning deep? I'm also conflicted about that. And I think they're not necessarily

333
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,180
one and done concepts. You might have periods where you're winning shallow and periods where

334
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:41,119
you're winning deep. But what I noticed in that documentary, I couldn't help focusing on it,

335
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,400
is watching Michael Jordan sitting in that big chair, tapping his whiskey glass, tapping his

336
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,740
glass.

337
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:57,880
There was a level of not enoughness about it that I think is probably quite unfulfilling.

338
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:08,480
And you see so many athletes achieve extraordinary things and unravel afterwards or express

339
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,579
dissatisfaction. And for me, what is the point of competition? It's chasing something for

340
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:17,259
fulfillment.

341
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,539
To find out what humans are capable of, to find out what you're capable of. And there's got to be

342
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,420
a point where it compounds, where you start to feel good about yourself, about your endeavor,

343
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:36,059
about the trust you put in this pursuit and your own ability. And if you're in that winning shallow

344
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:41,960
piece, as I think maybe Michael Jordan was for quite a lot of his career, you maybe don't feel

345
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,220
that. And you've interviewed some of his teammates. It'd be interesting to sort of see

346
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,759
how others feel about that. And I think that's a really good point.

347
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:47,900
And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.

348
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,019
A lot of people felt about that body count too, because what is it to be in a team? What is it to

349
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:59,660
compete? What is it to win? Maybe it's more than your own glory. And he's extraordinary. He's

350
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,200
probably the best athlete, but what did it cost? Yeah, as I'm listening to you speak, I think

351
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,880
the sadness to think that there isn't deep relationships with any of those teammates.

352
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:16,079
And I think he was quite open about that, that there was not a connection at all, even with

353
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,900
the ones that played six championships.

354
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,319
As you're talking, could you win five or four or three or two and have great relationships? Is

355
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,099
that bigger success? And I probably think the answer is yes, isn't it? In my mind, as I play

356
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,180
that out, that to me, the greatest thing about playing team sport was the relationships that

357
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,200
you had for life afterwards. It's a big cost. If in winning, you've given up all of that for life,

358
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
that's a big price to pay, isn't it?

359
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:47,240
Yeah. I think about that word competition and the origin of the word has got sort of two different

360
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,519
roots.

361
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:55,180
It's an old French and an old Latin. Conquerere is the old Latin. And conquerere means to compete

362
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:05,680
against. And it's kind of like dominate over. It became dominate over to beast somebody, to be on

363
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:14,839
top, to be unquestionable, unassailable in your dominance. And the other origin of the word

364
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,880
was more like to run alongside.

365
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,559
So you can't find your very best unless you've got an amazing athlete running alongside you

366
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:31,279
to compete with. And that was more like testing your mettle, finding what you as a human being

367
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,720
are really capable of. I think of people like Kipchoge when I say that, and like extraordinary

368
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,980
athletes that really are testing the bounds of possibility rather than trying to dominate.

369
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,259
And there's something really interesting in our culture, especially our sports culture,

370
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:47,900
where we say, oh, I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to

371
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,460
win. And we seem to have picked up a lot of the time the rivalry. And our language is about the

372
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,819
rivalry and about smashing and dominating and conquering. And I think that sets a cultural

373
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:06,079
tone that is scarcity, that's glory and individual glory or individual team glory

374
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:13,339
against all else. And for me, the stronger possibilities are in the respect of competing

375
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,859
and the human potential in competing. And I think you've got,

376
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,039
all the same effort, all the same grit, all the same blood, sweat and tears, as I said,

377
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,119
to get you there. But the feeling is very, very different. And I think that's really sort of an

378
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,339
essential part of that. Are you winning shallow or deep? What and who was it for? And how do you feel?

379
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,700
We all are born different.

380
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:46,460
As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks uniquely our own.

381
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:56,480
Charting our life's course. No one sees an idea, opinion or opportunity like you.

382
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:04,079
And no one sees you like VU. Victoria University. Uniquely you.

383
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,380
My name's Gabrielle. I'm studying law. What made me want to get into law is,

384
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,859
I guess, the reward you get after the feelings that you get for helping other people.

385
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:18,839
I'm really passionate about making sure that people have that voice,

386
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,059
people that don't feel like they can be heard. And that's something that's really important to me.

387
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,480
I have quite deep personal values. So it was really important to me to find a university

388
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,619
that aligns with those values. And VU's that for me.

389
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,619
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect, is something we're really passionate and proud of.

390
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,240
We bring together groups of five to six people around the globe from diverse backgrounds,

391
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,980
sport, industry, social venture and the arts, and come together to learn, to connect and to

392
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,299
collaborate.

393
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:56,240
The thing that I've loved about it is not just the meetings that we have with our group. It's

394
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,400
the thinking that you do for days and days afterwards. Someone says something and it

395
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,680
sparks a thought. And within my sport and within women's sport, I'm just someone who

396
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,339
I try to lead by keeping people talking about the issues. There's times when I think the person I'm

397
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:14,079
trying to convince is not listening to me. It actually got me thinking about this is how I

398
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,279
need to address my communication with them. So it was, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

399
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,759
Yeah, I was thinking as you were talking about James Tompkins, I was lucky enough to interview

400
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:30,619
on this podcast. He's a six-time Olympian, one of the greatest Australian athletes, a triple gold

401
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:36,380
medal winner. And he referenced a couple of times, and I won't get this quite right, but the original

402
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:42,700
ode of the Olympics, the original creed, which was talking about the wholeness of a person and that

403
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,019
you needed great academics for the mind and you needed spirituality for the soul. And the physical

404
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:49,240
part was just part of that. And I think that's what I've learned. And I think that's what I've

405
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:49,279
learned. And I think that's what I've learned. And I think that's what I've learned. And I think

406
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,539
of the all-round performer and you celebrated the great all-round human being, not just

407
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:59,160
the athlete who could run the fastest or the longest. And maybe it feels as though our world's

408
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,480
gone the other way, isn't it? That we don't value the whole rounded part that you're talking about,

409
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,940
that maybe is sort of fearing less and living a more wholesome life.

410
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Yeah, I totally agree with that. Two words you use there, whole and soul,

411
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,220
that I think are really central in this. Human performance, human endeavour,

412
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,480
whether it's sort of scientific breakthrough or Olympic gold, has always been about understanding

413
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,880
ourselves. How far can we go? What are we? Who are we? What's possible? And I think as we've got

414
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:42,220
more excellent at the technical, we've lost something in there. We've kind of mechanised

415
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,720
ourselves a little bit, become a little bit maybe more robotic than we ought to be, a bit more

416
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,920
narrow, a bit more expert. And then in the deepening of expertise, potentially we've lost

417
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,420
some wholeness. And that for me is really a dreadful shame and something that we need to get

418
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,700
back to, especially for young people, young athletes. Renee Brown's a huge fan of your work,

419
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,900
Pippa, and references it regularly. And you've collaborated with her and the champion of the

420
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,220
word vulnerability is how I think of her. How big a role does that play for you in success in life,

421
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,700
being able to show up and be vulnerable?

422
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,319
Well, for me, vulnerability is really close to honesty. What am I prepared to share

423
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,559
with the world about who I am? And that doesn't mean you have to expose yourself.

424
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,279
And Renee talks about this a lot. It doesn't mean full exposure because you need to also feel safe

425
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,799
enough to be vulnerable. But if you can be honest about where you're at, you can adapt,

426
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,299
you can edit, you can show commitment, you can show love,

427
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,680
you can go deeper. And those things for me are massive performance factors. So vulnerability

428
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,660
is smack bang in the middle. And when we're not vulnerable, it's because we're unwilling to do

429
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,440
that. And that means that we have a boundary up somewhere. We're afraid of something and we're

430
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,240
going to do it our way. And that for me results in conformity. Yes, people, everything being a

431
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,539
little bit less diverse, a little bit more homogenous. And to me, that means you won't go

432
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,599
quite as far.

433
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,700
As you possibly could to your own edge.

434
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:25,900
Pippa, I mentioned in the intro that your work with the England football team has now been part

435
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,380
of a major theatre production. And Here England explores that psychology of the winning and the

436
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,319
culture shift in England football. What's that been like for you to see some of your work on the

437
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:36,700
stage?

438
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,779
I mean, it's an extraordinary privilege. And I'm really thrilled for what it's done for

439
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,420
sports psychology and the culture of sport. It's very weird to watch somebody play,

440
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,259
you on stage. The first time I went, I guess I'd met James Graham, the playwright and the first cast.

441
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,859
And I went and watched a play and I was cringing all the way through. But that's because I like

442
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:08,460
being on the sideline as well. But the second time I saw it, I could see the fun in it. And I just

443
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:16,200
thought, wow, that's really extraordinary that some of that work can result in other people even

444
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,420
thinking about whether they're winning.

445
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,420
Deep or shallow, whether they're living and performing with fear or if there's a better

446
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:23,920
option.

447
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:27,980
Pippa, you're writing again at the moment. You shared a little earlier about chronic

448
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,299
overperformance and how we can be more regenerative and whole in the way we approach

449
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,759
performance. Can you give us a little insight into what's struck a chord with you at the moment?

450
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,779
I've noticed over sort of, you know, 25 year career working with high performers that

451
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,420
there's a lot of patterns. And some of those patterns are what we've spoke about before,

452
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,380
that people don't feel.

453
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,880
As good as they could. And part of that is fear. But I also think that one of the behavioural

454
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,740
patterns that comes out of that is the sort of never quit mentality, but applied large

455
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:07,220
into all things in life. And I just see a lot of people really overperforming rather than performing

456
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:14,339
in a whole and excellent way. So I've been writing about and thinking about the sort of

457
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,460
narratives that underpin what it is that we do and sort of narratives of,

458
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,480
things like optimisation. It's never okay not to improve in the stories that we have about who we

459
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,440
are. And I think that that is really leaves us very thirsty, spiritually and otherwise. And I

460
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,640
really genuinely don't believe that that takes us to best performance. So there are moments to push,

461
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:47,259
but we're not diverse in it. We live push rush all the time. So optimisation is one example.

462
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,460
Another example is how,

463
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,119
sort of caught up we are in the sort of what I call the market narrative of like everything needs to be

464
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:01,720
visibly seen to be bigger, more, have more, do more, be more. And we see that in all sorts of ways

465
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,259
with performers and all of, I'm talking about all of us as performers. So I'm exploring that.

466
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm exploring how that leads to feelings of less and sadness and burnout. And then what are the

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,259
tipping points that turn us into,

468
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,599
living from a more whole place? I describe it as whole being. And then, you know, what would we

469
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,079
need to do if we were regenerative in our performances? How, what would we shift? Because

470
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,500
we still want to perform. Performing feels great, right? But to do it the same way all the time with

471
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,839
no off button, I think we've got a little bit caught up in a cultural narrative that doesn't

472
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,880
serve us as human beings. And the whole point is life.

473
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,619
Yeah. And we sometimes miss the point of life in pursuit of all these things, as you write

474
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,359
that beautifully.

475
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,319
In the race to have more and be more and be seen to do more. And people find it hard to talk about

476
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:00,779
soul or talk about love or even love in sport, you know, is how would you even introduce that? But

477
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,619
you're saying that they're the missing ingredients, that we're not actually

478
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,119
getting to that sort of deeper sense of what living is all about. Is that a question you're

479
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,359
asking?

480
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:16,920
Yeah, absolutely. For me, the pursuit of sport, this is why I think that those sort of root

481
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,460
origins of the word competition,

482
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,740
are so interesting, because it's all love. Everything I've ever seen in sport from working

483
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:30,920
with like six year olds through to vets, you know, it's about love. It's, it's, you know,

484
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,519
joy and potential and expression. And, you know, there are moments of in any sport, there's

485
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,880
aggression, and there's, there is dominance over and all of those things, but they've just become

486
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,119
so big. And they've been marketed, basically, to be,

487
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:57,240
too central. And actually, when you ask anybody, any athlete, or any coach, what is it that you got

488
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,099
from this? And they're going to that really, when you get down to the bottom of the ladder,

489
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:05,400
they're going to say love. You know, I felt something I didn't know was possible to feel.

490
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:12,460
I connected to people, to audiences, to fans, to teammates, and self love as well, if we get it

491
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,460
right. I think it's all about love. And then this, this question of soul, you know, which,

492
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,740
it's pretty terrifying, turning up and talking to a bunch of blokes with their arms folded,

493
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,039
usually blokes, in my case, in my career, talking about soul, and you know, that people are

494
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:36,819
imagining, oh, what is this? Where is this going? But actually, the sort of pursuit of something

495
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:43,819
else, something bigger, that, that is where that sits. You know, when we reduce it all to mechanics,

496
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,880
and the technical, and the expert, and the,

497
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,019
the mental part of it, and the, the piece that we have to say, why we can't fail,

498
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,539
and the this window only, you miss soul. And you miss love. And the whole thing has got a high risk

499
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:00,680
of not being worth it.

500
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,880
The saddest thing for me is, we all do things initially, because we love them when we're kids,

501
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,779
or we kick a ball because we're fascinated and we love it. And then you've witnessed it many

502
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:16,920
times over. And we've all seen this high profile athlete, who are all suffering performance anxiety,

503
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,099
or you can see the love of the sports completely drained out of them. And,

504
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:18,180
Yeah.

505
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,539
that that love of playing the game essentially goes with trying to be a professional.

506
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,119
Yeah. And sometimes with a coach or a leadership group in an organisation, I might ask,

507
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,880
what is it that you can't give up as a starting question, you know, and see where they're at in

508
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,920
terms of this idea of scoreboard winning versus what is this as a human endeavour? And of course,

509
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,859
there's the commerciality and all the other things that you have to roll into that,

510
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:52,420
but then they don't have to be exclusive. You know, if you work and play with love and soul,

511
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:57,420
it doesn't mean that everything else is going to go horribly wrong. It means that you actually are

512
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:04,680
motivated differently. Your sense of why is different and deeper. And then all the things

513
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:12,000
that we were talking about before around ability to accept change or to go through volatile periods

514
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,839
or vulnerable periods or to deepen commitment.

515
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,019
They're much deeper and much stronger, but you can't force that. You have to do it through love

516
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:26,259
and soul. And so, but it's scary for people if they feel it's got to be now, it's got to be this way.

517
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,759
There'll be old school coaches listening to that going, what do you mean, let go of

518
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,420
the competitive element and that can't possibly work. But you're saying even in the most elite

519
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,220
environments, if you simplify it back down to that and you regain your love and your connection

520
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,819
for what you're doing and your connection to your team,

521
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:49,740
find something deeper, performance is going to go up. That's what the research is saying.

522
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,240
That's the guts of it. And it's actually not about lowering competition. Competition's

523
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,640
brilliant. Competition's very natural to us as a human mammal. But it's, what does that mean to

524
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,000
you? Can you compete to find what you've got, find what the team's got and take the threat

525
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,760
and the scarcity out of it, take the urgency out of it and think about human,

526
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:21,599
potential. That's where it's at. That's the gold in it. So it's method, it's all method,

527
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,099
especially for the old school coaches who have really got, a lot of those people have got wins

528
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,840
on the board and experience doing it a particular way. But what we also have to remember is how much

529
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,960
the world changes and how the younger generation of people who are listening have so many different

530
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,940
influences than they did even 15, 20 years ago.

531
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,260
And we've got to adapt with it. And so understanding what it is to help them

532
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,900
find the very essence of sport that that old school coach felt when they were first pulling

533
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:01,360
their boots on, why did they love it? And where is that essence now in it? And the mentorship

534
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,880
and the care and the adult figures and the guidance, all the things that we don't talk

535
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,480
about in sport that are so critical and why coaches matter so much, especially now at this

536
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,719
moment.

537
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,360
For young people, that's, you know, we need, we need that is just what is the essence and

538
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,900
is it still vibrant for you? Is it still vibrant or has that culture of scarcity and that little

539
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:34,760
bit of not good enough fear and a little bit of push and rush taken over? And where does fear sit

540
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,579
and how can you let go of it? Because they've got everything they need, but fear gets in the way.

541
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:44,280
The brilliant way you articulate it. And I think it just makes sense when you boil it down,

542
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,840
but we get lost.

543
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:50,840
In the race of life, as you described, a bit obsessed with this idea that there's patterns

544
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,199
of what makes people successful and someone as thought out as you, I'm curious in these answers

545
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:01,719
and where idea of sort of self-leadership, but that it's hard to lead anyone else without this

546
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,679
idea of what you do to feel your best so you can lead others effectively. Can you share with us

547
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:09,500
what fills your bucket up so that you can be the best for others?

548
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:14,099
You know, I think one of the most important things that I have learned,

549
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,440
and that I do myself, I strive to do myself, but I also have seen in great leaders is letting go.

550
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,860
So I think, you know, when you fail or you stuff something up, or even when you really had

551
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,659
something that you thought was all promise and you loved it, sometimes you've got to let it go.

552
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,659
And that's really hard. There's like a living grief that goes with those things. And being

553
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:44,199
able to metabolize and compost that and move is really important. There's plenty of times where

554
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:50,500
we've all taken a wrong turn or maybe a wrong role or, you know, a wrong partnership, or it shows

555
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:57,579
up in all sorts of ways in life. But how can you let go and ground yourself and go again, move again,

556
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:03,139
not just from the perspective of resilience and bounce back, but in terms of genuinely composting

557
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:10,000
and growing again? You know, I think that's so important and very, very underrated as a sort of

558
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,739
a factor for whole being and a factor for performance.

559
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,119
You've got a specific example.

560
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,440
On that, Pippa, that you've been able to just, right, that turn didn't work out. Have you got

561
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,219
one that springs to mind?

562
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:25,920
Yeah. One that was quite hard for me, but after I was at England and I went to work with an

563
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,139
organization called Right to Dream, who I really loved. Right to Dream, they had a football club

564
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:40,920
in Denmark, in Copenhagen, and they had academies in Ghana. And I went as a chief of culture,

565
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,980
loved it. And then they actually got,

566
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:50,360
acquired by an organization which enabled them to really fund what was going to happen next and

567
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:56,360
scale. But in that scaling and that changing, and especially because they ended up in North America

568
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,980
rather than back in the UK, I wasn't going to be able to do my work there. And I didn't want to be

569
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:08,119
on a plane all the time. And I really cared about the organization. So I had to let go. You know,

570
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,039
I really found some grief in that because I cared deeply, but it wasn't the right fit.

571
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,039
So it wasn't going to be the right fit in a way that let me stay whole. So sometimes you get one

572
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:25,440
of those, you know, and I still really care about them, but I had to let it go because it wasn't

573
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,039
going to be right. And every time you do that and you let it settle, something else grows out of it.

574
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,159
Is there one piece of leadership advice that you pass on the most?

575
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:40,800
You know, I'm not a fan of the one piece or the silver bullet, but because it's always so nuanced

576
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,019
for me. But I suppose it's always so nuanced for me, but I suppose it's always so nuanced for me,

577
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:48,079
the thing I would say is to get to know yourself, genuinely, actually get to know yourself and

578
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,300
especially what you prefer to avoid. Because you as a leader, however good you are at the thing

579
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,719
that you do, you're the instrument of the work. So unless you're well-tuned, unless you actually

580
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:08,340
understand you, you're not going to be able to play it as well. And, you know, I think that's

581
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,000
really critical. So there's a lot of times we get really good at stuff, but we still don't

582
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:18,940
know who we are. Yeah, beautifully said. You've had a unique vision for the way that culture

583
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:25,360
should operate and you've evolved it over time and shown up in these organisations that have

584
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,960
some challenge. How have you been able to get others on board with the vision that you've been

585
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:37,000
pretty clear on for yourself? That's not always easy. I think things are changing. But one thing

586
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,320
that I would say is that, and again, it's another strange word sometimes in sport, but intimacy.

587
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:50,219
So to be able to talk honestly and frankly and sincerely and in a real way with the people who

588
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:58,199
are the decision makers and the culture makers and to say what I mean, to walk in the door and

589
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:05,320
say what I mean rather than hedge, win favour, you know, find the lay of the land. You've got to run

590
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:12,039
a parallel process with doing that and make sure that you're credible and trusted, but you actually

591
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,000
have to speak straight. You've got to speak straight. You've got to speak straight. You've

592
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:19,500
got to speak straight too about what you see and what you mean and build partnership. So I think

593
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,739
that that's where it starts of actually saying really what you mean when you go in and you're

594
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:31,300
building culture or working on human potential, human performance. So people that I have the

595
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,199
privilege of sitting down with this situation is normally inherently curious, Pippa, and that

596
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:42,300
curiosity can take them down different rabbit holes. Have you got an example of a curiosity

597
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:51,219
you've been down of late? I'm always here. I'm in a warren of curiosity, not just one rabbit hole.

598
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,719
I live in that. I think probably the one that stands out for me is I'm always curious about

599
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:05,039
why people resist things. Where does resistance come from? Is it actually fear? Is it genuinely

600
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,880
informed by experience? And what does it get in the way of? So often when I work with leaders,

601
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
I do something called slow coaching.

602
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:20,380
Where a coach or a leader will come and I'll spend, say, three days with them. And the first

603
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:28,159
day and a half is just regrounding, recentering. You might be out hiking. They might be in the

604
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,460
sauna in the ice bath. They might be just getting back in their body, basically, so they can

605
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:39,380
think spaciously. And one of the things quite often that I speak about with coaches or leaders

606
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,559
when I do that is, what is it that you'd rather avoid?

607
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:48,380
Where are your points of resistance? And I always get really curious about what comes up there. It

608
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,260
informs the rest of the work for the slow coaching. And I think it just lets you go

609
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,000
layers and layers and layers deeper.

610
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,320
We love this quote that the cost of leadership is time. How have you been able to manage that and

611
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:08,039
still live the balanced life that allows you to live the way you want to without fear and showing

612
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,400
up authentically yourself? Can you share that path for you?

613
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't.

614
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,719
I don't always get that right. I haven't always got that right. Because I'm very curious, I can

615
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:23,880
easily be too busy. But I've really, I had to have a think about what I cared most about a few years

616
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,400
back, you know, as I was getting too tired and a bit burnt out. And just let things go. So now I

617
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,219
do work that I care most about, which means some sacrifices and a lot more saying no when I would

618
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:43,000
like to help. But I have to say no a lot more. And, you know, I think it's really important to

619
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:49,980
be curious. And I think that's a really important part and really really important for me. I absolutely

620
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,619
need the time on learning and curiosity. And I absolutely need time outside. I could actually live in a

621
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:05,059
rabbit warren, I think. And where I live in the world as well, it allows me to be sort of outside and I

622
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:12,219
find vibrancy there. And so I've got really attuned to how I'm actually feeling. You know, where am I at in myenn

623
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:17,639
space have i created for myself and if i'm going to work with somebody if i'm going to

624
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:23,659
coach somebody um and they've given me the privilege of having their time and their

625
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:31,280
vulnerability then i need to show up in good shape so that becomes like a central reason for me to

626
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:39,980
do less actually um and i do so much less than i used to now but i just really like the things

627
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:46,159
that i do people the idea of understanding how you communicate you get that precious time in

628
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:53,019
organizations and you've already described how nuanced it is to to be able to come in with your

629
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:57,300
message you have a mantra when it comes to how you communicate in your work i don't know that

630
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,460
i've described it as a mantra but most certainly i would go for you know my my response to that

631
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:09,860
would be to to do your very best to show up honestly you know and again

632
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:16,880
isn't about avoiding pretending or or deceit in any way but to just show more of what you

633
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,980
are about and what you care about and then trust that if it's right for that organization or that

634
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,380
leader or that set of leaders then that then naturally a trust and a partnership will develop

635
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,179
but you know that is where you find influence rather than selling or promoting that is where

636
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:39,960
you find genuine connection rather than pushing and that's

637
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,880
that's always better always better for me who's been the greatest leader in your life

638
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,699
i think my husband actually you know who's a um it's easy to just sort of go to a professional

639
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:59,159
setting for thinking about leadership but he leads so differently to me he's he's um he's really

640
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:04,659
um people oriented in a sort of community sense he's much more social than i am

641
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:09,960
and his way of leading is to really stick with a problem and stick with a purpose

642
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,719
and until it's resolved and he showed me so much more about walking with

643
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:21,639
people in different ways um more subtle ways you know because the work i'd done had been sort of

644
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:28,039
a formal helper and he helps in really different ways and he's so in service so i think he's

645
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,679
probably been the best leader in my life yeah what a great answer we're a bit obsessed with

646
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,239
this idea of collaboration if you're on what it's like when you put inspiring people together and

647
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:39,719
how great things happen and yeah you've collaborated

648
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,539
around the world with extraordinary people has there been one person that you thought

649
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:48,820
wow i'd love to you know when in one of your passions in life is there a name that springs to

650
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:57,000
mind you know um more recently in the last sort of five years i know it's mad to do more doctoral

651
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,559
work but i did and i went down the path of ecology and eat what's called eco psychology or ecological

652
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,079
psychology which is about understanding how the way things work in the natural world is the same

653
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:09,840
way that things

654
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,679
work in the human mind and the human world so this sort of idea of culture and nature coming

655
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:21,300
together it's a bit of biomimicry it's a bit of um sort of systems thinking so there's a couple of

656
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,960
like amazing people in that world um that i would really love to to spend time with and collaborate

657
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,739
with there's a guy merlin sheldrake who's done all the stuff on mycelial networks and how things

658
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:39,380
collaborate underground and how how we know so little about it but it's so

659
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,239
informative it's such a different form of intelligence so i think i would go that way

660
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:51,840
actually to to find more people who think about nature and culture together and see if i can bring

661
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,719
that i don't think i've ever spoken to anyone who's done two doctoral degrees people it's a

662
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,639
great effort and you know the wealth of knowledge that you've brought to the world and and really

663
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,579
changed the way people think and continue to think in such a profound way is a great message for all

664
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,820
of us around the race of life and slowing down and that fear that's in all of us is a great message for

665
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,960
us if we stop and think about it we're all playing sometimes a role that we you know creeps into our

666
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,340
life and yeah it certainly have made me stop and think tonight about what's important and and you

667
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,300
know slowing down and uh it's a short life and i think you've got a great perspective on how to

668
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,199
live the best version of it it's great to see you again and really appreciate you taking the time

669
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,539
