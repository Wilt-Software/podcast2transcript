1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,419
How do you break the status quo?

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,720
Pursue what you think is right and lead in a fight for the voiceless.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,120
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,760
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,679
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective.

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,600
I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,039
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

8
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,619
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:01:07,040
Today, I caught up with Professor Pat McGorry, a psychiatrist known worldwide for his development and advocacy for youth mental health services.

10
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,739
In an environment which wasn't necessarily accepting of his passion, I talked to Pat about fighting for what's right

11
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,620
and how he has led the way in saving millions of young Australian lives.

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,579
Professor Patrick McGorry is a leading international researcher, clinician and advocate for youth mental health reform.

13
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,079
He is the executive director of Origin Youth Health, a world-renowned mental health organisation for young people

14
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,200
that has put Australia at the forefront of innovation in the prevention and treatment of mental illness.

15
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,760
Origin targets the needs of young people with emerging serious mental illness

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,340
and has become the model with which many youth mental health services use around the world.

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,760
Pat McGorry is also a founding board member of Headspace, the National Youth Mental Health Foundation.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,340
He believes that early intervention offers the greatest hope for recovery

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,719
and therefore takes every opportunity to educate the community to recognise the early signs of mental illness

20
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,060
without stigmatising or discriminating.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,319
His extraordinary 30-plus years of contribution to the improvement of youth mental health in this sector

22
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,759
has transformed literally the lives of tens of thousands of young people all over the world

23
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,860
and in 2010, his recognition for Pat's extraordinary life work, he was named.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,960
As the Australian of the Year, Pat, congratulations on a lifetime of contribution and achievement.

25
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,199
I wanted to just start by saying thank you for your time in this important time, it seems, in the world.

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,199
But firstly, where did the passion for youth mental health come from?

27
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:39,719
Well, I remember when I was a young medical student, I was looking at the spectrum of medicine, really,

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,759
and one of the areas that was, from a human rights point of view, that was so underserved and so neglected was mental illness.

29
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,379
You know, people...

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,639
In those days, we were locked away in, you know, mental hospitals, asylums,

31
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,800
and it was like a 19th century approach, really,

32
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:01,060
and I just felt that there are many areas of medicine you can work in,

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,819
and I did actually work for about four years in general medicine, in diabetes and those sorts of areas,

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,919
but really, you know, there was more than enough being done in those areas.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,120
All of those areas were improving and, you know, well supported financially and with skill and talent,

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
but mental health...

37
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,620
You know, it needed something very special to happen,

38
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,139
and I thought maybe I could make a better contribution there.

39
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,939
People tried to talk me out of it.

40
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,080
They said, don't waste your life, you know,

41
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,159
because the prejudice and stigma was even worse in those days,

42
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,900
and it's improved a lot in recent years.

43
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,419
But actually, because it was coming up such a low base,

44
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,000
we can make a huge difference if we improve things in that space.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,280
So that's what attracted me to it,

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,879
and I guess I felt an affinity for the suffering of the people, too,

47
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,400
you know, the old school approach to medicine, the vocational sort of feeling about it.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
I definitely think I had that,

49
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:59,340
and I've been very lucky to have a lot of satisfaction and sort of reward

50
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,900
from being able to work in an area where you see so many people benefiting and recovering,

51
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,539
and they wouldn't have otherwise if you hadn't sort of put that effort in.

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,259
Yeah, I love the sense of empathy, Pat,

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,719
whenever I hear you talk about your genuine care for this space,

54
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,500
and I did want to ask you that because I had read that that was the case,

55
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,879
and your colleagues in the medical fraternity almost tried to talk you out of it

56
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,100
and said, as you just quoted, then don't waste your time.

57
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,740
This is not an area that needs that attention.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,160
So it was literally people said to you, don't worry about this space.

59
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,920
Was that one of the things that came your way?

60
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,560
Yeah, because I actually, without sort of promoting myself too much,

61
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,560
I actually was – I did quite well in my medical course,

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,759
and I probably could have done – I would have had the opportunity to do other things.

63
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:52,220
If I wanted to, and people probably around me sort of probably saw that,

64
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,300
and they said, well, why are you doing that?

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,600
That's a waste of time, because they actually didn't see the people

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,579
with mental illness as fully human, I don't think.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,959
It was that bad, you know, and it's hard to imagine, in fact, these days, isn't it?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,620
But that was the way they thought, and we still see that structural stigma

69
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,800
in various areas, and the underfunding of mental health until just about now

70
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,420
has been a result of that.

71
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:17,819
Yeah.

72
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:17,879
Yeah.

73
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:17,899
Yeah.

74
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,180
In medical research, even though, you know, we brought the biggest grants

75
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,959
from the US and Europe into medical research in Australia in mental health,

76
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,439
our colleagues in medical research tend to look down on our research

77
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,980
as somehow not being as good as theirs.

78
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,120
So there's still that sort of judgmental and stigma operating.

79
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,879
Yeah, it's remarkable, isn't it?

80
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,680
And we're all thankful, Pat, and so many are, that you used your skills this way.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,639
You did qualify as a surgeon and a doctor, and you went down this path.

82
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,699
But can I ask you, I feel like there is clearly in 2021 and now an understanding

83
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,879
for those that probably generally are well and haven't suffered a medical illness

84
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,220
in the mental health space, that they have an understanding of you need to do things

85
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,079
to protect and better your mental health.

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,879
I don't think a lot of people had made that connection until recently.

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,639
Is that a fair thing to say, Pat, in your mind?

88
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,639
Yeah, that's a very astute observation, Luke, I reckon.

89
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,560
And that's one of the benefits of the pandemic, even though it's unleashed a shadow pandemic,

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,980
on us with another 25% of people needing professional help for mental ill health.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,120
It's sensitized the whole population, whether it's, you know, just watching our kids,

92
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,000
our teenagers and our young adult kids struggle, because they've borne the big burden

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,600
of the pandemic, really, or it's ourselves.

94
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,839
I mean, maybe we haven't become, you know, seriously mentally ill as a result of the pandemic,

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,680
most of us, thank God, but many of us actually got pretty close to the edge

96
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,600
of the precipice there.

97
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,220
And all of us have suffered a loss of well-being and morale, I think.

98
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,180
We've all lost the sort of access to things that make life worth living during the last

99
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,660
18 months or so, especially in Melbourne.

100
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,060
And so we feel it, you know, we know, we've got a better idea of what it feels

101
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,220
to lose mental health.

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,980
And when you turn for help, you can't access it at the moment.

103
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,079
It's very difficult to access, and the quality of it isn't what it could be, I suppose.

104
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,079
So I think it's great to have the public sort of...

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,500
What's the word?

106
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,939
They've had awareness for years in a superficial sense, I mean,

107
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,879
but they haven't really felt it.

108
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,339
They haven't, you know, I think in a deeper way, like you're alluding to, yeah.

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah, I might jump into that, Pat.

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,980
The term shadow pandemic was a really profound use of words that you really brought

111
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,819
to people's attention around what was going on.

112
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,079
And it's hard to ignore you and I both living in Melbourne,

113
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,519
and for those listening around the country or elsewhere in the world,

114
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,959
it is the record for the most locked down city in the world, Melbourne.

115
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,920
And tragically and unfortunately, and it felt to me, Pat,

116
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,060
in some ways as a perfect storm for our youth.

117
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,959
And clearly, you're at the coalface of this and you've seen a 25% increase.

118
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,560
But there is, you know, even watching my own household full of teenagers

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,720
and your own kids and their friends just to see the impact, Pat.

120
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,540
There are some numbers that I can't get out of my brain, Pat,

121
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,519
that you'll probably be able to clarify.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,300
But Damon Johnson, the Australian, was reporting several weeks ago

123
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,819
that at the peak of this last lockdown in Melbourne,

124
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,779
there was 830.

125
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,759
Eating disorders diagnosed a week in Melbourne.

126
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,699
In one city, there was 350 of our teenagers presenting at emergency

127
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,759
because their families were so concerned about the fact

128
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,819
they may take their own lives.

129
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,740
There was a couple of hundred a week who were self-harming in regularness.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,480
In that sort of numbers, as you said, a shadow pandemic

131
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,659
that wasn't being spoken about or discussed.

132
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,360
What advice have you got for parents that have been generally concerned

133
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,960
about their kids through this time?

134
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,919
What are some practical things that parents can do, Pat?

135
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,299
On the numbers, before we get into that,

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,720
we run five headspace centres across the North West through Origin

137
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,139
and we run the state specialist mental health system at Origin too.

138
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,460
There's a backup system to that.

139
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,779
We've got about 1,000 young people on our waiting list

140
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,059
who can't get into our system because it's just not built to scale yet.

141
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,460
And as you say, a lot of that is young people, young women quite often

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,799
with an emerging eating disorder like anorexia nervosa.

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Or combinations of that with anxiety, depression and often a lot of self-harm

144
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,320
because they've discovered that that's a way of alleviating

145
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,820
the emotional pain temporarily.

146
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,299
It's kind of a very disturbing thing, isn't it,

147
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,639
when you see people cutting themselves to relieve emotional pain.

148
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,600
Parents really freak out when they see that happening quite rightly.

149
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,580
But it shows how desperate the situation is.

150
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,840
So that's what we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis.

151
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,580
And in terms of what...

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,179
And I suppose the first thing is recognition.

153
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,120
And you don't want to kind of, I suppose, panic.

154
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,860
Just because your teenager is having a bad day, you don't want to overreact

155
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,600
because it's an emotionally challenging time growing up

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,200
and working out who you are and dealing with bullying

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,139
and peer groups and all that sort of stuff.

158
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,220
We all have to do it.

159
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:12,700
But 50% of the young people as they navigate that transition to adult life

160
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,419
will have a period of poor mental health.

161
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,940
So it's not like we're...

162
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
Medicalising it is just a reality.

163
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,440
And what we've got to do is help those kids

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,419
because if they're not helped, you know,

165
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,779
it's the biggest cause of death in young people

166
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,080
up to the age of even 40 is suicide.

167
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,679
And it's certainly by far the biggest cause of disability

168
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,700
or not fulfilling your potential as a human being

169
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,980
if you have untreated mental ill health.

170
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,159
Often it's quite obvious that the young person has become more withdrawn,

171
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,559
they're not going so well at school,

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,259
they're not so much in contact with their friends

173
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,759
or they're angry and irritable.

174
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,899
Not just on a one-off,

175
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,940
but just a sustained, you know, irritability, anger and distress.

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,360
You know, I mean, you can see the distress.

177
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,679
Now, obviously, more obvious things like weight loss in a young woman,

178
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,879
that's a warning sign.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,059
So if parents are worried, they should definitely educate themselves

180
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,379
and also try to access help.

181
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,440
The parents will have been affected badly by the pandemic.

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,340
Parents will have suffered.

183
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,679
A loss of reserve, a loss of morale,

184
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,159
a lot of, you know, loss of kind of well-being themselves

185
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,139
and they might be struggling as adults.

186
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,179
And if the parents are struggling,

187
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
it has obvious secondary effects on the kids, doesn't it?

188
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,159
Because the parents and the peer group are the support system

189
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,360
and the teachers, they're the support system

190
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,539
for that young adult, emerging adult.

191
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,480
And if the support system is struggling,

192
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,419
then the young person will struggle too.

193
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,220
And Pat, one of the things as parents that, you know,

194
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,639
a lot of us spend a lot of time, as you'd be aware,

195
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,559
trying to manage screen time these days

196
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,700
and make sure that your kids have enough balance.

197
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,500
You've got to live with that world

198
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,340
and there are some benefits clearly to social media.

199
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,879
It's a topic that's talked about regularly,

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,379
but particularly in Melbourne,

201
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,960
where you've had two years of training kids to a screen at homeschooling,

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,720
you can just see that has become an even bigger issue

203
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,980
for kids then to get them out connecting.

204
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,639
And, you know, I use the word perfect storm,

205
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,919
but for young teenage girls in particular

206
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,639
and young boys seeing these unrealistic images on social media

207
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,840
that, you know, they're not going to be able to get out of school.

208
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:15,940
And I think that's a big issue.

209
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,100
They're bombarded with,

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,720
without the connection of sport that's been taken away

211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
and without all the things that keep them healthy,

212
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,419
those intricate social catch-ups and connections

213
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,200
that have been going, Pat, it's staggering.

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,100
And for you to say you've got a thousand kids in your centres alone

215
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,940
that can't access the help they need,

216
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,039
I mean, that's a stunning thing to me in such a developed city

217
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,379
that we're not able to look after them.

218
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,840
Pat, am I reading that the right way?

219
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,940
And I think, you know, we were lucky we've got a Premier

221
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,539
and a Deputy Premier that recognised this

222
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,940
and we had a health minister

223
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,740
so Martin Foley, we had a Royal Commission

224
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,139
which actually recognised the massive underinvestment

225
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,919
in mental health care, especially in young people.

226
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,080
So that is going to get fixed over the next few years.

227
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,059
But right now, we've got a thousand young people,

228
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,340
many of whom are in life-threatening situations

229
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,740
that we can't help.

230
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,059
Just imagine what that feels like for a mental health professional

231
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,379
to be in that situation.

232
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,179
It's as if, you know, with COVID,

233
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,279
it's as if they had to turn away two out of three COVID cases

234
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,940
who might die.

235
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,059
That's what we have to do every single day.

236
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,059
And Pat, I'm so grateful that you're shining a light on this.

237
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,419
And I know, you know, you've got great, you know, ability

238
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:28,539
and what you've done to respond, but exactly that choice, isn't it?

239
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,559
For your healthcare professionals that can't literally save lives

240
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,480
in this space, but for families as well

241
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,580
who are watching literally their young children

242
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,179
without the ability, you know, to get help for them

243
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:42,480
is just a heartbreaking thing.

244
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,480
And I've seen it personally around the people

245
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,120
that we live with that have got children

246
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,720
that literally can't get an appointment for 18 months.

247
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
There is no opportunity there.

248
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,340
So how do you, is there any solution, you know,

249
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,279
Pat, to that crisis at all in the short term or not?

250
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,460
Yeah, I think there is because,

251
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,080
and you've got to fight for your family, right?

252
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,360
And whatever the health problem.

253
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,480
And so GPs, thank God for GPs, they are there

254
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,519
and they will actually see people, you know,

255
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,000
and then it's up to them to try to find a pathway

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,259
into it.

257
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,000
Into more expert help when it's needed.

258
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,559
And it can be done, but it takes a predetermined, you know,

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,960
family and a predetermined GP to do that.

260
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,679
And then the last resort is the emergency department.

261
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,620
That's why you're seeing the blowouts

262
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,360
in emergency department stats for young people especially

263
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
because the emergency department can't turn,

264
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,139
well, it has to see people, you know.

265
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,519
It's the only way you can actually get seen.

266
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,120
Now, because the channel is so narrow,

267
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,460
a lot of those people bounce out.

268
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,299
And they don't make it through.

269
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:49,919
But that is the place, those are the two options

270
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,019
if you can't find a way in anywhere else.

271
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,080
And we're working really hard.

272
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,799
And look, I've got to be grateful to the government here

273
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,840
because they are actually investing now.

274
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,659
We've got the money to actually employ more people,

275
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,299
but we've got to find them.

276
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,039
So we have to find them from other states,

277
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,259
maybe from overseas now the borders are opening up.

278
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,019
So I think we're doing everything we can to sort

279
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,700
of get reinforcements and build the system.

280
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,399
And that's been our problem, Luke.

281
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:15,460
Yeah.

282
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,980
I mean, you know, we haven't had the public support

283
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,720
that has forced politicians to respond.

284
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,740
And I think the World Health Organization is saying

285
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,980
that by 2030 it will be the biggest issue

286
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,279
that mankind faces, anxiety and mental health related issues.

287
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,419
I have had this thought, Pat,

288
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,799
and in no way is this a political statement at all.

289
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm not angling in that in any shape or form.

290
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,820
But I feel so passionate about it, Pat.

291
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,159
You mentioned the word recognition.

292
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,899
To me, the news coverage quite rightly of the concerns

293
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,320
around people and the virus have dominated the cycles.

294
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,860
And as you said,

295
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,679
the attention on this when you actually say the numbers

296
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,539
out loud, you can't ignore them.

297
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:52,740
And perhaps this is something for me in a city like Melbourne,

298
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,059
I feel like I want to get the other leaders that we know

299
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,860
of the community to come out and assemble en masse under the banner

300
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
of we're showing up for our kids.

301
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,000
They've been put through two years of something

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,860
that no generation have experienced before.

303
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,139
It feels like this is just going to get passed again

304
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,659
in the news cycle if we don't do something a bit more dramatic.

305
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah, that is a great way to think, Luke.

306
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
And in fact, you know, we've got a lot of people out there, you know,

307
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
who are going to get back to school.

308
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,279
And I've got to say that, in fact, after 2010, when I had that lucky break

309
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,220
and became the Australian of the Year, I had a chance to have,

310
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,659
I suppose, campaign in a stronger way.

311
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,860
And I tried to sort of set up an organisation modelled on GetUp

312
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,460
so that it mobilised large numbers of people across the country around this issue.

313
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,860
And it was called Australians for Mental Health.

314
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,539
And it took me a couple of goes to get enough money to sort of get it off the ground.

315
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,580
And just in the last year or two, we managed to get more funding support.

316
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
So, it's a real...

317
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,799
It's a real campaign now.

318
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,580
It's called Australians for Mental Health.

319
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,139
We have a campaign director called Chris Raine, who set up a thing called Hello Sunday Morning

320
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,960
years ago, which was to help people moderate their drinking.

321
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,980
So he's a bit of a young entrepreneur, a bit like what you were talking about before about

322
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,659
leadership, younger people and the collaborative leadership.

323
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,660
He's amazing.

324
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,900
So he's mobilised this, you know, sort of a platform for a campaign.

325
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,579
And we need probably a few hundred thousand Australians to join this, as you're saying,

326
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:20,220
like, not to kind of protest in an aggressive way, but just to show the politicians that

327
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,539
this is something that the whole Australian public care about now.

328
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,200
And they expect the right quality of care.

329
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,980
And also the research, like, you know, I'm a researcher as well as a clinician.

330
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,759
And so, I realised that we've got to keep learning and keep discovering new ways of

331
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,720
helping and solving these problems because it's not just, you know, the way mental health

332
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,799
is reported in the news, it sounds like all you need is a few sessions of counselling,

333
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,099
and everything will be okay.

334
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,359
But mental illness is much more complicated than that, and it requires scientific breakthroughs

335
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,839
and knowledge, just like all the other areas of healthcare.

336
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,839
Yeah.

337
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,160
Australians for Mental Health will get all those links, Pat, and make sure that likewise

338
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
donating to Headspace.

339
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,920
So if you are commercially minded and you have got a passion, please, we'll give you

340
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,660
the links to donate to Headspace or I love the idea of what you spoke about, Pat, using

341
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,440
a get up style campaign to shine a light on what is unfolding in our communities, particularly,

342
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,839
on the back of these challenging times.

343
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,400
I wanted to maybe just steer back a little bit, Pat, and maybe a more basic question

344
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
to me.

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
What are some of the things people listening to this can do in your mind to practise good

346
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,380
mental health routines, even if they haven't suffered in the past?

347
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,259
What are some examples that really average people can add to their routine if they want

348
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,480
to have a mental, healthier, happier in life?

349
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Yeah.

350
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,279
Well, I think there's a whole range of things that people can do to improve their mental

351
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,279
health.

352
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,559
You know, like things that might work for different people.

353
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:56,400
For me, I always enjoyed sport and physical activity, so staying physically fit is very

354
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
important for me.

355
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,519
I found that very difficult during the pandemic, not being able to go to the gym, for example,

356
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:07,500
and not being able to go for a surf, things I really depended on being able to do.

357
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,359
So I think that's one thing.

358
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,119
Other people might prefer just reading or just reflecting.

359
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,119
Yeah.

360
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,720
Maybe you can do a little more, more calmer sort of pursuits.

361
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,000
But things that make life worth living, things that you get positive feelings from, really.

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,640
I mean, that's, and relationships is another one as well.

363
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,839
I suppose, you know, having friendships, having intimate relationships with people, that those

364
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:38,599
are things that the scaffolding around someone that keeps them, you know, upright and alive

365
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,079
and enjoying life.

366
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,400
So a lot of it's probably pretty simple.

367
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Connection with nature.

368
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
Connection with nature is another thing.

369
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,400
I think that was another thing that we suffered from,

370
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,500
being locked into our homes.

371
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,660
We couldn't actually get out into nature and be exposed,

372
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,559
whether it's the beach or the forest or for a walk along the river

373
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,359
or whatever it is.

374
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,519
And all those things were kind of more difficult.

375
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,819
So a lot of that is common sense.

376
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,160
Now, that will help you with positive mental health.

377
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,619
It doesn't necessarily always protect you against becoming depressed

378
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,920
or unwell.

379
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,819
So there might be two different sort of patterns there.

380
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,619
But the things that cause mental illness, you know,

381
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,299
apart from the genetic or biological basis for it,

382
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,119
the risk factors are things like loss, you know,

383
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,859
if you lose someone in your family, like a death in the family,

384
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,880
especially if there's a traumatic aspect to it,

385
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,140
and other types of abuse or trauma or bullying.

386
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,240
Those are the sort of things that undermine mental health.

387
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,440
And you see that, you know, when people go through those experiences,

388
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,339
those ordeals.

389
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,799
And so trying to obviously protect people against those sort

390
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,119
of negative experiences is another thing.

391
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,460
Yeah, I was having a conversation on this forum, Pat,

392
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,920
with Steve Butoff, the author of, you know, many kids' books,

393
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,980
sorry, books for parents really on adolescence and growing up.

394
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,980
And he referenced just the devastating statistic on how many kids

395
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,480
really experience some form of trauma in their upbringing.

396
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,660
And, you know, close to 70% in one of the studies that was a really

397
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,400
extensive study on what young people are experiencing.

398
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,579
Is that, in your mind, one of the core causes that kids really do have

399
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,640
environments that cause some stress?

400
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,140
Yeah, I would say trauma, like a lot of kids, you know,

401
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,380
like when I work in Origin or Headspace, I see the histories of,

402
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,480
there's about a third of the kids that have been through some kind

403
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,920
of significant trauma, but probably more, another thing which isn't

404
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,039
talked about as much as trauma is attachment problems, you know.

405
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,759
So that, for example, the kids that go in and out of foster care,

406
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,240
they have about 15.

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,339
Their parents, by the time they're, you know, 15.

408
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:49,039
So that rupture of attachments and bonds, relationships is very destructive

409
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,839
to the development of a healthy sort of personality and a strong sort

410
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,259
of person, a strong personality that's not so vulnerable to mental ill health

411
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,059
of various kinds.

412
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,299
But, yeah, I think those two things, loss, attachment and trauma are the kind

413
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,799
of psychological risk factors that impact on people.

414
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,299
And then there's the...

415
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,819
The more biological ones, you know, so that you might have more

416
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,400
of a genetic vulnerability to different types of mental illnesses,

417
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,619
which these environmental risk factors bring out.

418
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,460
So if you think about mental illness, people always argue,

419
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:29,740
is it the brain, is it biology, or is it psychology or the social

420
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,819
environment that causes it?

421
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,759
Well, it's both, you know.

422
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,900
It's like with any health problem.

423
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,559
It's a mixture of, you know, biological vulnerabilities

424
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,160
and the environmental factors that operate on you as a growing person.

425
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:41,140
Yeah, Joel.

426
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,819
The debate isn't nurture or nature and what part...

427
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:44,220
That's it.

428
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,420
...it plays, doesn't it?

429
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,740
It's always a fascinating conversation, isn't it?

430
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,640
What parts or equal parts?

431
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
You know, as you're talking again, Pat, I was just thinking about, you know,

432
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,980
obviously the pressures that have come of this time and obviously living

433
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,200
through a period where kids have then been isolated in their homes

434
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,579
for extended periods.

435
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,500
In this podcast, we talk a lot about collaborative leadership

436
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,700
and self-reflective leadership.

437
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,059
Understanding that measures had to be taken through a pandemic, Pat,

438
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:11,119
and I think that's a big part of it.

439
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:11,140
Yeah.

440
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,740
And we're not, again, trying to necessarily hold people

441
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,220
to account for their decision-making, but was there enough conversation

442
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,579
because there really, with kids missing school for the amount of time,

443
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,019
kids that were in vulnerable homes, being locked in those homes,

444
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,980
not getting those outlets, had to cause, you know,

445
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,619
more issues than there would have been in the past?

446
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,279
Do you feel like people understood that as a cost of what was going on

447
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,539
in the pandemic, cost of lockdown was always going to be this?

448
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,660
Do you feel like we were collaborated with enough on that?

449
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,059
I accept that until you got to a high level of vaccination,

450
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,519
which probably took a lot longer than it needed to,

451
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,140
we probably had to protect life.

452
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,400
Otherwise, we would have had, you know, instead of hundreds of people dying,

453
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,519
we would have had thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people dying.

454
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,599
So that was a pretty high priority to get right, you know,

455
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,779
which we sort of did, you know, really.

456
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,700
But I suppose at the same time, we didn't actually measure

457
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,819
and count the cost and take enough steps to sort of mitigate

458
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,019
the other impacts.

459
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,500
And obviously, mental health is the main one that I've been aware of.

460
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,200
But again, that's been difficult because governments have neglected

461
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,500
mental health for so long.

462
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,420
That's why we had the Royal Commission even before the pandemic,

463
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,240
that you can't suddenly rebuild from a ruin, you know,

464
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,380
in the middle of a pandemic.

465
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:30,680
It's been difficult for them.

466
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,339
And so, but you're talking about, I suppose, the preventive measures.

467
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:39,339
Could they have been a little bit more sort of flexible about some of the sort

468
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,339
of lockdowns?

469
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:41,440
And those sorts of things?

470
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,319
It's difficult to see exactly how.

471
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,019
But now that we're out of that phase, I think it's fantastic

472
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,640
that they've decided we're not going back.

473
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,099
You know, we're going to do everything except lockdown, you know,

474
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,779
from now on.

475
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,839
And I don't think the public would tolerate it anymore now that we've got

476
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,960
to these high vax levels.

477
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,819
Now that they've done that, they have to really, as you were saying before,

478
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,180
recognise what the legacy of this kind of extreme measures actually is.

479
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,559
You know, in other words, we've done modelling ourselves at Origin.

480
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:16,319
You know, we're a research institute and we predicted this 30% rise of new cases.

481
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:20,059
And what we predict is that it's not just going to disappear when lockdown

482
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,180
finishes, it's going to last for months and years.

483
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,359
So you alluded to that yourself, this generational effect.

484
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,839
And so we've got to actually make sure we take care of those people

485
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,200
and help them to recover.

486
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,319
And with the right sort of help, they will.

487
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,460
But if they're just thrown on the scrappy, they won't.

488
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,160
And a lot of your modelling does include economic costs in preparation for this

489
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,460
conversation.

490
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,440
And, you know, reading one of your studies of, you know,

491
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,920
over a $10 billion economic cost annually in Australia with the issues that our

492
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,980
youth face in mental health.

493
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,460
And you can even break that down per person.

494
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,779
I think you had it at $10,500 in loss of productivity effectively out of having

495
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:57,779
to deal with young children.

496
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,420
So it is a huge cost to the system, isn't it, Pat?

497
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,940
So it does open the door for more investment because those dollars will be

498
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,400
rewarded.

499
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,160
If we look at it as unemotionally as that, keeping people healthy in this space

500
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,940
is a pretty vital thing, isn't it?

501
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,380
Yeah.

502
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:17,640
It's like a win-win because, you know, we make the argument for treating cancer

503
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,160
because we want to save lives.

504
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,920
But it's not a very cost-effective investment treating cancer because it's

505
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,059
mostly older people, you know, who are not going to contribute an awful lot to

506
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,339
the economy beyond that point on average.

507
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,759
I mean, but no one would think that way, would they?

508
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,180
They would just think we want to save lives and we want to help people live as

509
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,880
long as they can.

510
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,039
Well, we've got that argument in mental health.

511
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,359
And it's even more so because it's in much younger people.

512
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,619
But because it's in younger people, 75% of illnesses appear before the age of 25,

513
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,299
very different from cancer and other medical illnesses.

514
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,059
If we get more people recovered and cured or in remission or even functioning

515
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,279
better, the return on investment is massive.

516
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,099
And that's what the Productivity Commission showed, that we'll not just save

517
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:07,240
lives and futures, but we'll actually save heaps and heaps of money if we invest

518
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,720
in mental health.

519
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:07,920
Yeah.

520
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:07,940
Yeah.

521
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

522
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,039
Yeah.

523
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:08,059
Yeah.

524
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:08,079
Yeah.

525
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,099
Yeah.

526
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:08,119
Yeah.

527
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:08,140
Yeah.

528
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah.

529
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,180
Yeah.

530
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,240
Yeah.

531
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,339
Yeah.

532
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:08,420
Yeah.

533
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,440
Yeah.

534
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,500
Yeah.

535
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,519
Yeah.

536
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:08,579
Yeah.

537
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:08,619
Yeah.

538
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:08,640
Yeah.

539
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah.

540
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,019
Yeah.

541
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,079
Yeah.

542
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,099
Yeah.

543
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:09,140
Yeah.

544
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah.

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,240
Yeah.

546
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,339
Yeah.

547
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:09,380
Yeah.

548
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah.

549
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,500
Yeah.

550
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:09,519
Yeah.

551
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:09,539
Yeah.

552
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:09,559
Yeah.

553
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:09,579
Yeah.

554
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:09,599
Yeah.

555
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:09,619
Yeah.

556
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:10,539
It's different from cancer.

557
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,259
You actually will get a massive return on investment if we actually do this

558
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:16,619
properly.

559
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,859
I wanted to ask you a question, Pat, or perhaps a bit of a statement.

560
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:30,839
A passion of mine for my own mental health, Pat, was something I stumbled

561
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,900
across as a 19-year-old in the world of meditation and mindfulness.

562
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,579
And we do some work in education and we've been running programs in the last

563
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:43,799
couple of years, particularly in a pipe in South Australia, where we've taught

564
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,779
teachers a toolbox of techniques.

565
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,960
In that field, Pat, where we give them an array of meditation, mindfulness

566
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,279
techniques and breathing techniques, and then they've been able to, A, look

567
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,859
after their own health and pass that on to kids.

568
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,420
And we've seen a great reduction in stress and anxiety and behavioral issues

569
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,099
in kids and class.

570
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,660
Are you a believer in those modalities as someone who's a researcher in

571
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,420
preventative mental health?

572
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,319
Do they play a role, Pat, for us to maybe get into better habits at kids in

573
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,059
school before some of these issues arrive?

574
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:12,859
Yeah.

575
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:12,920
Yeah.

576
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,220
Yeah.

577
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,279
Yeah.

578
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:13,299
Yeah.

579
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:13,359
Yeah.

580
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah.

581
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,579
Yeah.

582
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:13,660
Yeah.

583
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:13,680
Yeah.

584
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,700
Yeah.

585
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:13,779
Yeah.

586
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:13,920
Yeah.

587
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:13,940
Yeah.

588
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,980
Yeah.

589
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,019
Yeah.

590
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:14,039
Yeah.

591
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,059
Yeah.

592
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:14,099
Yeah.

593
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:14,119
Yeah.

594
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:14,140
Yeah.

595
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,180
Yeah.

596
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,200
Yeah.

597
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,579
Yeah.

598
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:14,940
Yeah.

599
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

600
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,039
Yeah.

601
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,059
Yeah.

602
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,039
Yeah.

603
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,259
Yeah.

604
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:16,500
Yeah.

605
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:16,720
Yeah.

606
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:16,799
Yeah.

607
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:16,900
Yeah.

608
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:16,960
Yeah.

609
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:16,980
Yeah.

610
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,279
Yeah.

611
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:17,420
Yeah.

612
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,359
Yeah.

613
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,599
Yeah.

614
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:18,619
Yeah.

615
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:18,660
Yeah.

616
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:18,779
Yeah.

617
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah.

618
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:18,900
Yeah.

619
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah.

620
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:18,980
Yeah.

621
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,019
Yeah.

622
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:19,039
Yeah.

623
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,140
It's good for normal people who don't have mental illnesses or mental ill

624
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,440
health.

625
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:29,119
And it can also help people who are diagnosed as well.

626
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,700
But I think, like you say, it's a universal thing that everyone can

627
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,359
benefit from managing stress in a better way and even helping people sleep

628
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:38,740
better.

629
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,920
You know, if you use those techniques to help you go to sleep, there's lots

630
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,259
of apps that will help you do that now.

631
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,980
So, yeah.

632
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,019
That's all really positive.

633
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:45,440
Absolutely.

634
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,440
But in terms of preventing, you know, the onset of anorexia or major

635
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,000
depression in teenagers or psychosis, psychotic illnesses, I don't think

636
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
it's really powerful enough as a technique for that.

637
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,099
But, look, it's got its place.

638
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:00,859
Of course, it has.

639
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,099
Yeah.

640
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,920
And can I ask you this question?

641
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,200
If, you know, you could wave a magic wand right now and you've 30 years

642
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,920
of incredible leadership and contribution in this space and cost is not

643
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,279
an issue.

644
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,759
And you wanted to try and I think origin stated goal is that all young

645
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,200
people to enjoy optimal mental health as they grow through to adulthood.

646
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,839
What's the thing you'd do?

647
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,180
What needs to be done to solve this in the best possible way?

648
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,759
Yes, that's a great question.

649
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,579
I think, first of all, because the mental health of young people around the

650
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,420
world was getting worse even before COVID and now COVID has added another,

651
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,880
you know, dollop of, you know, burden as well.

652
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:41,359
I would like to understand better why the mental health of young people is

653
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,259
getting worse these days.

654
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:46,299
And the sort of candidates that you mentioned, you know, social media and

655
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:48,079
stuff like that and the cyberbullying.

656
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,319
But there's more macro forces.

657
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,259
We call them megatrends.

658
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:56,920
The increasing insecurity of life for young people, you know, the fact they

659
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,299
can't afford to buy a house, that they've got to pay uni fees, you know,

660
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,259
the fact that climate change is hanging over them, the fact that inequality

661
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:08,640
in society is getting worse, you know.

662
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,240
We know that when you get people getting richer and richer at one time, you know,

663
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:15,980
one end and poor and poor at the other end and more inequality, that causes a

664
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,759
whole lot of social and health problems for that society.

665
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,920
It's an incredibly dumb thing for a society to do to allow that to happen.

666
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,940
But we're allowing that to happen here in Australia and around the world.

667
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,099
So those sorts of things have to be understood a bit better so we can turn

668
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,839
back the tide or stem the tide.

669
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,700
And then until we can totally, you know, stem the tide, we've got to actually

670
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,839
look after these young people in a much better way.

671
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,220
And so, therefore, we need systems of care.

672
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,339
Like, we've built headspace, Origin designed headspace and rolled it out.

673
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,559
And it's now going to be in 150 places pretty soon around Australia.

674
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,559
So that's great as an entry-level base camp.

675
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,619
So about a third of young people can be helped and will get a lot better with headspace.

676
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,720
The other two-thirds that come in the front door need to go to the next level.

677
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,539
But the next level hasn't been built.

678
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,460
It's like we've built the entrance hall to the house, but we haven't built the second

679
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,059
floor, the second story, you know, haven't built the other rooms in the house.

680
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,460
That's what governments need to do now.

681
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,339
And it needs to be powered by new research, you know.

682
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,880
And you mentioned new techniques.

683
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,680
Well, we're using virtual reality to kind of modernize and make more potent our

684
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,700
psychological therapies.

685
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
And then we need drug discoveries.

686
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,240
We need safer and better medications that can be used as maybe the third-line

687
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,599
treatment.

688
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:40,740
So we need to really invest in new systems of care and basically start flowing

689
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,140
into these systems the products.

690
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,279
of new research.

691
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:49,160
That's like a great project for Australia for the next 10 years to invest in all that.

692
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,160
Pat, I've been asking a range of leaders a series of questions that we think form

693
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,400
the dimensions of what makes great leaders in this modern world and modern time.

694
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,940
And we certainly see you, Pat, and your life's work in that space.

695
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,160
So please be as expansive as you like.

696
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm fascinated to hear your thoughts on it.

697
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,339
But we start with self-leadership as a dimension of what makes great leaders.

698
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,460
When I ask you about self-leadership, what do you think of, Pat?

699
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,019
Yeah.

700
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,240
First of all, I'd say I've been lucky to work with a lot of like-minded people

701
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,079
who also are leaders, you know, people with the same common view and mission.

702
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:26,619
You know, that's what I've been lucky enough to sort of have around me or with me,

703
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,319
you know, as friends and colleagues and not just here in Australia but around

704
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,019
the world too.

705
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:36,339
And, you know, people that have got the same sort of, I don't know,

706
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,839
determination, I'd say, as well.

707
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,599
We're lucky because we've got a purpose.

708
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:49,359
You know, we know what we want to see in the world, you know, and we're very devoted to

709
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,519
sort of following that purpose.

710
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:55,980
And it took me, you know, just speaking personally, it took me until my late 30s when I'd finished

711
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,519
all my medical and specialist training and also I'd finished my PhD before I got the

712
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,119
chance to do anything as a leader.

713
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,579
You know, I mean, I see these 25-year-olds these days who are starting their own companies,

714
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:11,460
who are, you know, doing amazing things and they have got the, they've got opportunities

715
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,200
which we didn't have in my day.

716
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:18,059
You know, we had to sort of get ourselves qualified and in position to do stuff, you know.

717
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,380
And I didn't really ever imagine I would have the opportunity to do the things I've been

718
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,920
lucky enough to have the chance to do.

719
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:30,519
So, but in a way, you know, I hear about, you know, you probably can relate to this

720
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,220
as a footballer, but you just don't think, you just take care of the basics and you just

721
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
think one step ahead at a time.

722
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,799
You don't necessarily think you're going to.

723
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,299
Do X or Y, but you actually just address the things that are right in front of you and

724
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,660
they eventually things start to build and you have, you create something and you have

725
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,779
some success and you just have to keep building on it and reinventing it.

726
00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:00,339
That's what I've found and find people who can share the same idea and you help each

727
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,700
other to do it and you never lose sight of why you're doing it.

728
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,780
So, some people build companies or organizations and they forget why they actually did that

729
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,440
in the first place.

730
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,340
Well, I think we just got to continually.

731
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,380
If you remember what we're actually trying to do, you know, the fundamentals, the real

732
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,920
basics, the grassroots, like seeing the young people like I do, I still, you know, work

733
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,800
on set days in the headspace in Glenroy and it's the best part of the week, you know,

734
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,960
and just being connected to the, what it's really about.

735
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,780
That's what I've found has been absolutely key for me.

736
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
I love it, Pat.

737
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,780
I get to hear that sense of purpose still in everything you say.

738
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,699
It's an amazing life's work.

739
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,219
A lot of people are understanding that now, but that has been clearly what you've done

740
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:40,699
from the.

741
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,219
You know, the various early days in your choices in life and talk about positively impacting

742
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,219
others in your environment.

743
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,539
It's interesting to hear you say about, you know, being fortunate to have those with you

744
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,440
with shared vision and shared determination.

745
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,380
When you turn up in the origin world or the headspace world and you're leading your teams,

746
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,840
how do you think about positively impacting those in your environment?

747
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:10,079
Yeah, look, I probably not always, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't sort of say I'm anywhere

748
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,079
near perfect.

749
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:18,079
I've probably got, I've got an impatience, you know, especially as I get older, you know,

750
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,760
because I think how much time have I got to solve this problem or to make this progress?

751
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,199
And so I do put pressure on people and that's probably not such a good thing.

752
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:35,860
You know, I probably, I've got, I expect people to have like energy and that kind of level

753
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,139
of commitment that you can't always expect that of people.

754
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:40,940
People talk a lot more these days.

755
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,440
These days about work-life balance and, and you know, they're not quite so single-minded

756
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,059
and there is a cost to being like that too, like in your, in your personal life and, and,

757
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,619
and in your, with your relationships, you've got to be careful.

758
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:58,940
And I probably, you know, I've been, I haven't always had the right balance myself, but so

759
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,179
the people around me, I've got to constantly remind myself that they are, you know, that

760
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:06,619
they've got lives and they've got choices too.

761
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,940
So just to kind of respect that a bit more than I probably, I do some of the time.

762
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
But, you know, I've got to be careful.

763
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,119
But I do, I do sort of feel that, you know, we, we are privileged as well when we get

764
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,119
to these sort of positions.

765
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,239
Like I've got, I've got 12 professors working at Irish and working on different research

766
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,239
things.

767
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,619
And so I think if you're in that position, you know, you've got a responsibility to

768
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:32,659
use your talents and use your, you know, opportunities for, for good and having really good, what's

769
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:38,480
the word, trusting relationships with people, trust and, and, and sort of values are really

770
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,940
important as well.

771
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Culture.

772
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,320
You know, I think about football clubs here too, but I think definitely about, about clinical

773
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
settings.

774
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,219
If you've got a really good culture in the clinical setting, which shows that like a

775
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:56,659
real compassion and almost like a love or an affinity for the young people that we're

776
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,219
sort of looking after.

777
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:02,539
If that comes through that, that's a really precious thing to kind of nurture.

778
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:05,460
And that probably has to be at all levels of an organization if you can, if you can

779
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,239
pull that off and, and, and yeah, so it depends on all of us having, having that, having that,

780
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,239
having that kind of culture.

781
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,239
So I think that's really important.

782
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,239
Yeah.

783
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,440
That's, that's definitely, it's really important to have that feeling, having that, having that,

784
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,659
that feeling, not just one person is in a leadership role.

785
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:23,380
Pat, I have to ask you, as a father of three and, and a long-term marriage as well, is

786
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,059
it possible to achieve what you achieve?

787
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,559
And as you said, there's sometimes you felt like everyone's going through that work-life

788
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,559
balance.

789
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,400
I mean, is it, is it something that you look back and think you would have done, you do

790
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,179
differently if you had your time again, or have you felt like, as you've got older, you've

791
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,619
got that, that mix, the right.

792
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,619
It's a hard one, Luke.

793
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:39,619
I mean, you know, I, I don't know that I've done a good job.

794
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,039
You know, you look back and you can have regrets about your life for sure.

795
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:51,000
And one of the things I think I probably, in a way I was selfish

796
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,579
because I wanted to pursue what I was trying to do

797
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:56,599
and I should have spent more time with my kids

798
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,760
and I should have not travelled as much.

799
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,260
And, you know, obviously things happened because I did those things

800
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,599
in a wider way.

801
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,860
But, yeah, there were sacrifices, not just for me,

802
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,760
more for my family, I would say.

803
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,960
That's the thing I should have had a better balance about those things for sure.

804
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,559
But, you know, you sort of don't realise, you mature, you know,

805
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,699
maturation's a slow thing and you look back and you think,

806
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,380
well, yes, I could have done that a bit differently.

807
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,820
And, yeah, I definitely have that feeling.

808
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,900
I want to ask you about creating and sharing your vision.

809
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,860
And it's an extraordinary vision that was rewarded, as we said at the start,

810
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,900
with the Australian of the Year and that platform.

811
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,579
But, as you said,

812
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:39,599
Headspace will be in 150 different communities.

813
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:43,559
The work that Origin has done in groundbreaking research

814
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,780
and it's a massive vision for a huge issue.

815
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,780
And your answer before was you've got second and third levels

816
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,079
that you really want to get to.

817
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,500
How do you go about sharing and creating that vision?

818
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:57,719
I never thought of myself in the way that you were talking about me here.

819
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,420
I just thought it was so obvious, you know, what needed to happen.

820
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:06,219
Because I saw these young people back in Royal Park Hospital back in the 1980s

821
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:06,940
coming in.

822
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,300
In the middle of the night, shackled by police, handcuffed by police,

823
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,539
you know, acutely mentally ill, psychotic hearing voices.

824
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:19,239
And they came into this environment surrounded by 45-year-olds

825
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,260
with chronic mental illnesses.

826
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,940
They were terrified, you know.

827
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,139
And they'd been unwell for maybe a year or two,

828
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:27,139
sitting in their bedroom quietly psychotic.

829
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,480
And I thought it was just so obvious that what we had to do was find them

830
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,619
much earlier when they first started to become unwell,

831
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,199
like you would do with skin cancer.

832
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,480
You know, chest pain or something.

833
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,920
You find it as soon as it starts to become a problem.

834
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,699
And you treat them in a very careful, nurturing way with skill

835
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:48,500
and scientific sort of treatments.

836
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,420
And that is not exactly rocket science.

837
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,199
It's so obvious as a logical thing to do.

838
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,239
But trying to make it happen in the real world,

839
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,820
especially when everyone in those days thought those kids were not salvageable,

840
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,440
like they were written off.

841
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,219
You know, they were told, you know, you're going to become disabled

842
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:06,820
with schizophrenia.

843
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,480
That sort of horror message was given to people.

844
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,619
So to me, I never thought it was a vision.

845
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,880
I thought it was just absolutely bleeding obvious, you know,

846
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,619
what needed to happen.

847
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,539
And fortunately, it's such a simple thing, early intervention,

848
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,860
treating people properly and trying to get the best possible life for them.

849
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,559
Everyone's on board with that now.

850
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,679
But they weren't in those days, and yet it's so obvious.

851
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,219
And now all we've got to do is execute it, really, because, you know,

852
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,159
the evidence is there.

853
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,300
And it's just really a question of getting the money,

854
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,239
the talent enough and skilled, compassionate people to actually work

855
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,260
in those sorts of models.

856
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,579
Yeah, it's important that we don't forget recent history, isn't it?

857
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,800
I'm obviously a generation younger than you,

858
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,619
but where I grew up in South Australia was next to an asylum,

859
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
and we were terrified.

860
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,659
We were terrified to walk past and terrified of some of the inmates getting out.

861
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,239
And that was the stigma, wasn't it?

862
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah, that's exactly right, Luke.

863
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,420
And I always thought, even though, you know,

864
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,940
someone that, you know, had never come in contact with serious mental illness

865
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,619
might be frightened by it, when you actually talk to people,

866
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,960
they're just like us, you know.

867
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,760
They're human beings, and they're just the same.

868
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,280
They just happen to have a set of symptoms which can really be quite disturbing

869
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,800
for them, but they're treatable.

870
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,059
I mean, and when they are treated, they're back to normal,

871
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,340
but in the vast majority of cases.

872
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,460
So it's not as mystifying and terrifying as people think,

873
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,800
although to go through it without the right sort of care is terrifying.

874
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,460
But we see curiosity as a great dimension of modern leaders like yourself

875
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,960
and people using almost curiosity as their way to learning

876
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,980
and developing themselves, and clearly your history

877
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,360
of educating yourself is extensive.

878
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:53,500
How do you approach that now at this stage of your life

879
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,780
through the lens of your own learning and development

880
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,840
and maybe curiosity?

881
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,659
What does that mean to you?

882
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,119
Yeah, that's a great question.

883
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,460
I still am pretty curious.

884
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,519
Like you mentioned eating disorders and anorexia before,

885
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,400
that's something that I'm very curious about now because I've seen so much of it

886
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,820
in the last 18 months just directly and seeing how it develops

887
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,619
and how it's the most misunderstood illness now, I would say.

888
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,780
People have not really got a fundamental understanding

889
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,639
of why it happens or what it is, and there's very few evidence-based

890
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,500
treatments for it, so I'm very curious about that.

891
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,699
But in terms of learning, like I still want to keep learning.

892
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:32,800
I would like to learn more musical instruments.

893
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,340
I would like to learn more languages.

894
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm learning Irish at the moment.

895
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,199
You know, I'm president of a Celtic club, believe it or not,

896
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:43,840
and I was born in Ireland, and I'm trying to learn the Irish language

897
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,699
here in Melbourne, and I've been doing that for the last 18 months.

898
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,519
So I still want to learn, even though, you know,

899
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,900
probably running out of time, but there's definitely more things

900
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,440
I want to do.

901
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,780
Born in beautiful Dublin in Ireland, and your dad was a doctor,

902
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,260
I believe, Pat, as well, so it's fascinating.

903
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,139
You're full circle now, learning the Celtic languages.

904
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,380
It's quite incredible.

905
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,940
We talk about communicating with clarity as well a lot through this series,

906
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,980
and you've published, you know, I think over 400 peer-reviewed papers

907
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,260
and 50 or more chapters I was reading and edited over six books,

908
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,059
so you know a little bit about communicating with clarity.

909
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:24,099
How do you think about that in your space?

910
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,320
Yeah, well, that's sort of the thing that you have to do in the research world,

911
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,960
you know, publish papers, and the reason, hopefully, some of them are,

912
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,679
you know, advances in knowledge, and that's kind of the currency

913
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,000
of academic life, you know, but what I learned to do in the last 10

914
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,559
or 15 years is write for the general public, you know,

915
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,760
so I've written heaps of op-ed pieces in the newspapers

916
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,500
and shorter things, you know, trying to actually sort of persuade

917
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,500
and influence people and educate people, I suppose,

918
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,760
not just the scientific community.

919
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,420
I mean, there are battles to be fought there, like the one I mentioned

920
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,860
about trying to prove.

921
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,559
I think that early intervention works and early diagnosis works,

922
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,800
and that's been a big battle because, believe it or not,

923
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,460
people have tried to argue against it in psychiatry.

924
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:16,260
You know, it's quite, you never see that in cancer, you know,

925
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,260
but you do see it in the mental health field.

926
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,500
But so I've had to do it in the scientific field too,

927
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:25,019
and you have to be careful so that you don't lose your objectivity

928
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:28,000
and you don't become a zealot, if I can put it that way,

929
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,980
just like a, just a pure advocate.

930
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,800
You have to still have the, you know, the kind of rational,

931
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,719
objective objectivity about it there.

932
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:39,820
But I've learned a lot from my great friend, Ian Hickey.

933
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,679
I don't know if you've ever interviewed Ian, but he's got his own podcast.

934
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,639
But he is a fantastic communicator.

935
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,559
Like, he's on the drum all the time, and he's much better out than me.

936
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,380
But we both have the same objective to try to help the public understand

937
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,420
what can be done and what needs to be done.

938
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:00,159
That's fascinating, Pat, to hear you talk about.

939
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,840
So there's been opposition to early preventative care for mental health issues,

940
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,480
and in your world, have you had to face opposition on that?

941
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:09,179
I find that quite staggering.

942
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,599
It's like it's hyper-scepticism.

943
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,880
They want roll-gold proof before they do anything, you know,

944
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,239
whereas what you've got to do in the real world is you produce some evidence

945
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,719
about what's the best available evidence for what you should do.

946
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:28,519
And you see this in, you know, cardiovascular medicine too,

947
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,599
like, you know, the debates about things like aspirin,

948
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,199
whether it's a good thing to do or not.

949
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,519
And so people, you know,

950
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,420
look at the evidence, but in psychiatry I've found there's a small group

951
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,679
of academics that basically just try to undermine any piece of progress

952
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:45,639
because, well, it's not really clear.

953
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,440
They're just too sceptical or they're – there's other motivating factors perhaps,

954
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,179
but they undermine progress.

955
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,099
And it's been – so we've had these battles within the field as well

956
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,659
to try to get progress.

957
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,119
And, you know, hopefully – as it's turned out,

958
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:03,960
the evidence has just accumulated and that's washed them away in the end.

959
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
But, yeah.

960
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,539
It's been, you know, like a paradigm shift that we've been trying to bring about.

961
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,739
And the best allies in this haven't been colleagues, actually.

962
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,659
It's been the public and the families and the young people that we've worked with.

963
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,440
They're our best supporters and they trust us with the evidence too.

964
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:25,900
The last dimension we talk about is collaboration.

965
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:31,059
Great leaders we're seeing are really just passionate about how they collaborate,

966
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:34,460
who they collaborate with, and clearly to grow Headspace and Origin.

967
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,739
And what you've done is just quite extraordinary.

968
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:39,480
How have you thought about collaboration?

969
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,579
How have you gone about it?

970
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,000
Well, I suppose I thought about it in two ways.

971
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:48,599
One is the internal team, you know, like the internal footy team.

972
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,239
And you keep having to find new rookies and new draft picks and, you know,

973
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,619
and you want quite a few hundred gamers in there too.

974
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,500
So I thought about it that way in turn.

975
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,539
It's a team game, what we're doing, you know.

976
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,320
And obviously there's got to be a coach and there's got to be, you know,

977
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,400
a few star players.

978
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,739
So that's probably a simple person.

979
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,820
That's the way I've thought about it.

980
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,500
And then outside, you look around the world and you try to find the other people

981
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,480
that share your kind of, you know, purpose.

982
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,800
And even in other countries, there was a Norwegian psychiatrist in Stavanger

983
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,840
in Norway who was a, you know, very similar personality to me, I think,

984
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,119
you know, and campaigned really in that sort of more political way

985
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,699
for a better deal for the mentally ill.

986
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:33,380
So finding those sort of people to work with.

987
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,719
And it's very inspiring.

988
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,760
You can learn a lot from these other people.

989
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,059
Which leads in nicely, Pat, to a couple of questions I've been asking all the leaders

990
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,579
that we've had the privilege of speaking to.

991
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,599
And the first one is, who has been the greatest leader in your life, Pat?

992
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,940
Oh, gee.

993
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,900
I have to think about that one.

994
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,460
I think Nelson Mandela has been a pretty inspiring person.

995
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,219
If I think of political leaders.

996
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,619
I was always a big fan of Goff.

997
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:08,639
I grew up in the 1970s and, you know, I was a medical student

998
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,099
when Goff was the prime minister.

999
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:13,579
He threatened the status quo so much that they got rid of him, basically.

1000
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:16,980
And, but his legacy continued on for forever, really.

1001
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,019
And so he was very inspiring politically.

1002
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,559
Within the mental health field, the person that actually got me over the line

1003
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,360
to do psychiatry was a woman called Beverly Raphael.

1004
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,760
And she was the foundation professor in Newcastle.

1005
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,360
I grew up in Newcastle in Australia.

1006
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:32,980
And she was the founder of the University of Newcastle.

1007
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,219
And she was the founder of the University of Newcastle.

1008
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:33,380
And she was the founder of the University of Newcastle.

1009
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,940
I went to uni in Sydney.

1010
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,820
She had been an academic in Sydney, Sydney University.

1011
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,039
And she became the first professor at the new medical school in Newcastle.

1012
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:45,320
And I was a medical registrar at Royal Newcastle Hospital.

1013
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,039
And I went and had a chat with her.

1014
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,059
I said, look, I'd really like to do psychiatry, but it looks so terrible

1015
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,840
that working the conditions of the patients and everything is, do you think

1016
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,260
it's, you know, I needed to be sort of encouraged, I suppose, to take the leap.

1017
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,679
And she was a very special person.

1018
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:03,219
She had actually made her career.

1019
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:08,079
She made her career in the study of bereavement and grief, you know, so in other words, helping

1020
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,199
people to recover from what we were talking about earlier, the losses and traumas, and

1021
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,559
she became a disaster expert later on.

1022
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:22,219
But she was like a warm, compassionate woman who projected that and she was a great communicator

1023
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:23,219
too.

1024
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:24,219
She projected the warmth and compassion.

1025
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:28,800
A lot of psychiatrists that you see, the stereotypes, they're kind of a bit withdrawn and a little

1026
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,780
bit aloof, but she was the opposite.

1027
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,800
And so I could, I can imagine, you know, that she was the opposite.

1028
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,639
You know, being like that and seeing, doing something like what she was doing and what

1029
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:38,639
she had done.

1030
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,239
And so I think she was a very good leader.

1031
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:44,599
And then the person that brought me to Melbourne was a professor called Bruce Singh, who's

1032
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,500
working for her at the same time.

1033
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,280
And he was a different type of character.

1034
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,420
He was someone who could build things and he was a tough operator, like politically.

1035
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,360
And so I learned a lot from him too.

1036
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:02,099
So those two people were very good leaders within psychiatry and, you know, gave me the

1037
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,440
confidence, I suppose, to try to do something in their footsteps.

1038
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,179
What a great answer, Pat.

1039
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:12,559
That's from Nelson Mandela, right through to an inspiration very close to home, which

1040
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,940
is fascinating to look back and the journey of people that you've been exposed to.

1041
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,340
And the final question we've been asking in recent times, if you could collaborate with

1042
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,940
anyone in the world, Pat, anyone that we could put you in touch with, who would you collaborate

1043
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
with?

1044
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,940
Well, this might be a bit premature, but I've been reading a lot of books.

1045
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,940
I've read a lot of books.

1046
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:39,840
I've been reading some books by a woman called Mariana Mazzucato, who I got exposed to through

1047
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,900
my son, Fionn, that I mentioned before.

1048
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:50,019
She's written books about reforming capitalism so that it becomes of value to the community

1049
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:51,019
and the society.

1050
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:56,559
So in other words, not a revolution, but actually modifying it so that you don't get all of

1051
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,280
these, what she calls, rent seekers or value extractors out of the economy.

1052
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,519
So people have to contribute something positive to the economy, and you do see business people

1053
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,760
doing that these days, and I'm just thinking of Andrew Forrest.

1054
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,699
He's made a lot of money, but he's actually doing some good things, feeding back in.

1055
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,840
But she's talking about something a bit different, I think.

1056
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,460
She's talking about value rather than just money as what's produced.

1057
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:28,659
And it's very profound what she's writing about, and I thought trying to sort of build

1058
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,280
on that in the terms of like a mentally healthy lifestyle.

1059
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,280
Yeah.

1060
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,599
A healthy and mentally strong society would be a great thing to just at least probably

1061
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,599
support and understand more about that.

1062
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:43,320
But that's going outside of my field, really.

1063
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,559
But I'm impressed with her intellect.

1064
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,219
If you could get her on the program, she'd be a great one to interview.

1065
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:50,219
Much better than me.

1066
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:51,219
I'd love to.

1067
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:55,119
Pat, you've set a very high bar, and I've always been inspired by listening to you and

1068
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,800
have been fortunate enough to chat to you a couple of times in different formats.

1069
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,280
And the work you've done is inspirational.

1070
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,019
And as I said, I do feel, Pat, like I want to stand on the rooftops and try and bring

1071
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:07,219
as much attention to this.

1072
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:11,840
For whatever reason, I feel passionate about the fact that your term, Shadow Pandemic,

1073
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
has happened.

1074
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,320
And we need to really let people know that there is a massive, massive need for this

1075
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,219
and the work that you've done, for whatever reason, hasn't had that attention as the other

1076
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:24,679
illnesses in the past, but it feels as though it's going to be the great issue for our kids'

1077
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:25,800
generation going forward.

1078
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,599
So whatever we can do to support, Pat, we'd love to be behind.

1079
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,599
And if you feel like donating to Headspace, we'd love to be behind.

1080
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,199
Yeah.

1081
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:34,599
Headspace or Origin, we'll send all the links out to the fantastic work that you do.

1082
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,780
And Australians for Mental Health, if people more generally beyond young people want to

1083
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:44,659
kind of just raise the kind of temperature of that issue, that would be a great way to

1084
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:45,659
Australians for Mental Health.

1085
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:50,699
You could Google Australians for Mental Health and Chris Raine would be the person to contact.

1086
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:51,699
Australians for Mental Health.

1087
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:53,079
Yeah, we'll put all those details down.

1088
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,800
Pat, it's a great honor to have been able to spend some time with you again.

1089
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,320
Congratulations on all your work.

1090
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,519
And I'm sure there's plenty more chapters to come.

1091
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,639
Plenty more chapters to write.

1092
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,280
Thanks so much for your time.

1093
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,480
Well, you're way too kind, Luke, but thank you so much for the opportunity.

1094
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,480
I really enjoyed talking to you.

1095
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,670
