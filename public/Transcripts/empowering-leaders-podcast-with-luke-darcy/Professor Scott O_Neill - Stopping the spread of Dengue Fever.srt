00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,199
This week's conversation is with a truly remarkable Australian in my mind, Professor Scott O'Neill,

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,699
an Australian scientist who is on the path to eliminate dengue fever around the world.

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,379
You hear him talk about collaborating with some of the most influential leaders around the world.

4
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:30,879
His perseverance and dedication to impact so many lives is one of the great stories of leadership and success.

5
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:39,020
The challenge doesn't end. You have to keep going out there and showing people the benefit and how it's working and how it could benefit other communities.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,899
And so, yeah, the work continues. If our goal is really not about the discovery, our goal is about having the impact.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,979
It always feels like a real privilege to learn from incredible leaders like Professor Scott O'Neill.

8
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,620
It's the basis for the work we do in our leadership business, Alita.

11
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:22,099
Professor Scott O'Neill is an extraordinary Australian scientist, internationally recognised as the founder of the World Mosquito Program.

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,420
His breakthrough innovation of infecting mosquito communities with Wolbachia virus is proving to eliminate dengue fever,

13
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,680
which affects 400 million people annually, and other mosquito-borne viruses like yellow fever and Zika.

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,459
It is a truly remarkable scientific achievement.

15
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,340
Professor O'Neill's academic career has increased.

16
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:51,120
He's been a member of the Australian Academy of Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

17
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
and the American Academy of Microbiology.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,819
Professor Scott O'Neill, it's a great honour to spend some time with you.

19
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,879
Thanks for joining me today on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,739
Hi, Luke. Nice to be here.

21
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,379
Scott, it's an incredible story.

22
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:09,879
I think, how does an obscure bacteria like Wolbachia effectively become the centre of your life?

23
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,939
The potential to impact hundreds of millions of people around the world in a positive way.

24
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,780
Can you tell us how it all came about?

25
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,139
Well, it actually started a long time ago when I was a student studying for my PhD,

26
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:30,219
and I was introduced to this thing called Wolbachia, this bacteria, by my professor of the time at the University of Queensland.

27
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:39,539
And I got really just absorbed and fascinated with just the unusual things that this bacteria could do to insects.

28
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,479
But not just that, I was interested in how we might be able to utilise the power of this bacteria

29
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,259
to help in the battle against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

30
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,439
And so, you know, it's something that caught my eye many years ago.

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,780
I was directed to it, and I've been working with it my whole life, academic life now.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,860
Can we go back a little step to dengue fever?

33
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:09,039
It's probably the most known mosquito-borne virus that you work with,

34
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,259
and I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are.

35
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:10,300
Yeah.

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,360
Yeah.

37
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,960
There's 400 million people around the globe.

38
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,780
But how bad is dengue fever, and how important is it to find a solution?

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,580
The numbers are estimates, but we estimate that around 400 million people get sick each year.

40
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:32,199
But even more scary than that number is that half of the world's population is at risk of getting the disease any given year,

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,800
virtually anywhere in the tropics of the world.

42
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,199
If you live anywhere in the tropics of the world, you're at risk.

43
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,300
And the terrible thing about it is there's really no...

44
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,860
There's no effective treatment for it.

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,659
And so, you just have to weather the sickness when you get it and hope that it's not so severe that you die from it.

46
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,180
And so, to understand, you know, without getting overly technical, Scott,

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,599
but it's amazing that you've been able to, you know, I understand fruit flies are affected with Wolbachia,

48
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:10,020
but effectively what happens is the mosquitoes get that and then it shortens their lifespan and their chance of passing on those diseases.

49
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,199
Is that a simple way to explain?

50
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:12,840
Yeah.

51
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,620
So, you know, the way I would say it is that we found this naturally occurring bacteria.

52
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
It only infects insects.

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,759
It doesn't infect people.

54
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,779
It's called Wolbachia.

55
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:28,019
And we found that about 50% of insects carry this bacteria naturally,

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,839
but not the mosquitoes that do all this disease transmission to people.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,100
And the big technical breakthrough for us was that we were able to put this bacteria into the mosquito

58
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,899
that transmits diseases like dengue.

59
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,639
And when we did, we found that the viruses couldn't grow in the mosquito body.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,759
And if they can't grow in the body, then they can't be transmitted between people.

61
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:55,879
And so we had a way to naturally block the transmission of these viruses in human communities

62
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,360
by introducing the bacteria to the mosquito population,

63
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,560
essentially almost like vaccinating all the mosquitoes naturally

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,600
so that they can no longer transmit the viruses between people.

65
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,000
And so it didn't require anything to be done to the human population.

66
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,980
No medicine or drugs for the humans,

67
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,660
just focusing on the mosquito and being able to eliminate transmission that way.

68
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,079
And part of the brilliance of what I love about what you've done

69
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,899
is that it doesn't involve insecticides.

70
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,240
It doesn't involve genetic modification.

71
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,379
And I'm assuming mosquitoes play a really important role in the ecosystem.

72
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,199
So for it to be safe, it's cost effective.

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,579
I understand it's incredibly effective at the same time.

74
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,439
Feels like the perfect solution in lots of ways.

75
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,959
Yeah, in many ways.

76
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,959
You know, it's got a lot of very desirable,

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,500
As you said, it doesn't kill the mosquitoes.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,339
It just makes them harmless to people.

79
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,899
So they stay within the role.

80
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
If there is such a role that they might play in the ecosystem,

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,839
we're not spreading toxins around like insecticides that aren't that effective anyway,

82
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,439
but have a lot of knock-on effects into the environment.

83
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,740
So it's a really targeted green intervention.

84
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,560
But what I like most about it is that it self-sustains

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,259
so that once we deploy it,

86
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:09,379
we don't have to re-deploy it.

87
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:09,660
We don't have to re-deploy it.

88
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,720
We don't have to re-deploy it.

89
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:09,800
We don't have to re-deploy it.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,000
We don't have to re-deploy it.

91
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,540
Like with a vaccine,

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,319
you have to keep giving vaccines to newborn children or whatever.

93
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:17,000
With this, we put it out once and we're done.

94
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,060
And then it just keeps giving protection to communities

95
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,339
because the Wolbachia maintains itself in the mosquito population

96
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,480
and people get protected year after year.

97
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,879
So it's both sustainable and highly cost-effective.

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,800
And in the public, global public health area,

99
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,439
those are really key attributes that are needed

100
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,720
with a public health intervention

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,139
so that it's cheap and it sustains itself.

102
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,500
So many layers to this story.

103
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,240
And I also love, first of all, your genius to discover it,

104
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,420
to persevere because it wasn't an overnight success.

105
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,620
I mean, you've been toiling away for more than 20 years

106
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,779
to firstly get it to be proven in communities.

107
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,699
But the second part then is to scale this globally.

108
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,439
And that takes a whole different set of leadership skills.

109
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,519
Scott, I'm assuming a different part of your brain.

110
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
Can I ask you about part two?

111
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
What sort of leadership have you found within yourself?

112
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,160
You know, to firstly get this to work

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,980
and then the scaling part globally,

114
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,199
that must have been a second challenge.

115
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,160
Yeah, so I think, you know, firstly,

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,420
when you're doing anything that's very unusual or innovative,

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,980
there's always a lot of resistance to change.

118
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,620
And so, as you mentioned,

119
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,540
we've been sort of fighting uphill a little bit,

120
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,120
not just to show that we can do this technically,

121
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,660
but to gain acceptance of it

122
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,939
because it's different from what's been done in the past.

123
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,079
And so, you know, that's created a set of obstacles

124
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,300
that we've had to face.

125
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,720
It's required me and others in our team

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,740
to become effective communicators,

127
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,459
to be convincing people and doing advocacy

128
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,019
for the intervention that we've developed

129
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,620
so that people can understand it

130
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,579
and appreciate the value that it could bring.

131
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,759
And now, as you say, we're into the next phase now

132
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,019
of now that we've shown that it works.

133
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,639
We've currently protected around 10 million people

134
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,980
in 11 countries around the world so far in our journey so far.

135
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
But our goal is to get to 500 million,

136
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,600
and that's going to require, as you say,

137
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,980
a different set of skills

138
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,939
to be able to undertake that scale-up journey.

139
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,600
And so, again, you know, we're actively doing it

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,819
and it requires active advocacy for what we're doing

141
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,019
to drive the demand in communities

142
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,899
to make people aware of what we're doing

143
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,059
and to make it available to communities.

144
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
And so, yeah, there's different sets of skills

145
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,179
that have been needed across the whole journey.

146
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,200
That we've been travelling on and we do that.

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,620
I think we obtain those skills by mixing our team around

148
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,299
and we bring in new team members with different skill sets

149
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,720
as the challenges change.

150
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
And if anything, I think the contribution,

151
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,100
the leadership contribution,

152
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,639
the large one that I'm fortunate to be able to make

153
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,580
is that I think I naturally have a flair

154
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,159
for being able to help pick those teams

155
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,379
and to pick the individuals that we need at the right time

156
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,279
and to create an environment

157
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,840
where they want to collaborate with the rest of our scientists

158
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
and other people that work for us as well

159
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,860
to achieve the results we want.

160
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,620
So I think I'm a bit lucky in that I'm able to get together

161
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,960
and coalesce groups of quite different people

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,519
that are needed to execute on a really complex task.

163
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,179
And that is a brilliant skill

164
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,440
that clearly you've uncovered within yourself

165
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,620
and it's a real passion in the leaders that we talk to,

166
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,720
Professor O'Neill, around that idea of being able to collaborate

167
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,220
and to collaborate.

168
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,019
And get people on board.

169
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,539
You don't scale something like you have done

170
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,139
and the ambition to take it to 500 million people.

171
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,220
So was that just a natural thing you found

172
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,299
that you feel like you've got an ability

173
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,580
to get people on board with your vision?

174
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,740
Is that something that you discovered in this process

175
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,460
or was that evident for you at a younger age?

176
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,220
Yeah, I think, to tell you the truth,

177
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,200
I haven't really had a focus that much on it

178
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,120
and I don't just sort of do the introspection of what it is.

179
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,500
But I think, you know,

180
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,200
I think it's sort of,

181
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,700
it's something that has been natural

182
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,100
and I think, you know, in some ways

183
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
we're easy to work on a topic

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,639
that is relatively easy to motivate people around

185
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,539
because, you know, it's a good story we work on.

186
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:23,120
We're bringing hope to communities in the tropics,

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,980
poor people that wouldn't otherwise have it.

188
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,759
And so it's, I think, having passion about what we do

189
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,600
is a big assist in helping us to be effective

190
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,120
in being able to build the teams we require.

191
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,940
But, you know, I guess that what we're talking about,

192
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,419
I think, has just always been part of my personality.

193
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,220
And you started the initial pilot North Queensland up in Cairns

194
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,340
and there's an element of trust required, isn't it,

195
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,259
for a community to say,

196
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,039
hey, we're going to release mosquitoes

197
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,539
that are carrying a bacteria.

198
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,960
It's got, you know, an element you need to build into people

199
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,759
to say, hey, this is going to work.

200
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,820
And I suppose those North Queensland communities

201
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,940
are very familiar with cane toads

202
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,980
that were introduced back in the 90s.

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,299
I mean, it's a devastation that cane toads have caused

204
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,019
in that part of the world.

205
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,620
So that must have been an interesting sell

206
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,519
to get them to trust you.

207
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,360
Yeah, it was a very interesting time period then.

208
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,820
I think, you know, I was holding so many community meetings

209
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,360
in North Queensland and I was flying up there regularly

210
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,460
to talk to people.

211
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,919
And, yeah, think about what the ask was

212
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,039
that we had in front of people.

213
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,539
We were a bunch of scientists from down south

214
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:36,799
who had cooked up this idea that had never been tested.

215
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,179
And we were going to come to these communities

216
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,080
and these people had been listening

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,799
to health education programs for the last 30 years

218
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,200
saying you've got to kill mosquitoes to stay healthy

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,080
so you don't get sick.

220
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,000
You have a bunch of scientists who are going to release mosquitoes

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,279
into your backyard that are going to bite you

222
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,139
and your six-month-old baby and your 97-year-old grandmother.

223
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,340
And the scientists are not sure if it's even going to work or not.

224
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,740
And so, yeah.

225
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,039
It was a pretty big ask of the community.

226
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,440
But I have to say, you know, the people in North Queensland

227
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,820
appreciated our transparency

228
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,059
and they appreciated our authenticity of what we knew

229
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,460
and what we didn't know and being prepared to talk to them

230
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,240
and people about why we were going to do it.

231
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,159
And the good people, people who live in North Queensland,

232
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,019
and they ended up welcoming us in,

233
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,379
not just for their own benefit, interestingly,

234
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,139
but for there was a serious interest in being involved

235
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,580
in something that could help.

236
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,100
Other countries and other people.

237
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,360
So I was quite surprised by that.

238
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,000
It wasn't total self-motivation around the people in North Queensland

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,700
where we started.

240
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,720
Amazing story that needs to be shared and told

241
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,860
and done on the back of your skill

242
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,600
and reading about just the technical difficulty

243
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
of what you tried to do.

244
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,600
And it was described, I read someone describe it

245
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,500
as effectively getting a needle that's hair thin.

246
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,679
You're injecting this bacteria into a mosquito egg

247
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,240
that's the size of a poppy seed.

248
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
I mean, you were toiling away at that

249
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,340
for a long time.

250
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,399
I mean, you were toiling away at that for a long time.

251
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:06,480
I mean, you were toiling away at that for a long time.

252
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,559
I mean, you were toiling away at that for a long time.

253
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:06,779
I mean, you were toiling away at that for a long time.

254
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,940
You must have had to find some resilience

255
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,799
to get that to work.

256
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,440
Can you tell us a bit about why and how you did that?

257
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,259
Yeah, I don't know if you've been travelling

258
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,360
around the world in Asia.

259
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,620
You can see people on the street making money

260
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,720
by engraving your name on a grain of rice or whatever.

261
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,039
I've always marvelled at the skill of those people.

262
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,419
And what we were doing was somewhat similar

263
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,100
but even more frustrating than trying to do that

264
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,659
was to, as you described,

265
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,179
I sort of liken it, if you could imagine,

266
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,340
taking a knitting needle and being able to put it

267
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,820
into a balloon full of water

268
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,360
and then pull the needle back out of the balloon

269
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,539
without breaking the balloon.

270
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,580
That's sort of a sense of what we had to do technically

271
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,799
under a microscope to make this thing work.

272
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,299
And it took many years to get that to happen.

273
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,559
Lots and lots of failure.

274
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,379
My story's full of failure and perseverance,

275
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,120
I think, as you said originally.

276
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,480
So, yeah, we just had this grind.

277
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,139
This grinding obsession that this was going to work.

278
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,740
And so, yeah, we spent, we kept persisting

279
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,240
and wouldn't accept the failure

280
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,940
until eventually we were successful.

281
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,779
What I love about so many of these incredible stories

282
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,820
of leadership is that we read out the headlines at the start

283
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,639
and we talk about you creating this technology,

284
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,679
but we always, that's the bio, we overlook the 20 years of,

285
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,879
as you said, frustration and could this work?

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,539
Is it going to work when I release these mosquitoes

287
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:42,220
in Queensland?

288
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,299
Is it going to work when I release these mosquitoes

289
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:42,320
in Queensland?

290
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,679
Is it going to work when I release these mosquitoes

291
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:42,700
in Queensland?

292
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,120
Is it going to work when I release these mosquitoes

293
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,139
in Queensland?

294
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,320
There must have been some nervous moments around that.

295
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,940
I mean, I think pivoting to the next part,

296
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,299
which I think is equally brilliant,

297
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,100
to get funding at the level you had, you know,

298
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,779
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

299
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:57,399
the Gillespie Foundation, who are the founders

300
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,620
of Baker's Delight, they're incredibly sophisticated

301
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,779
and smart people.

302
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,899
They're big on impact and you need to prove

303
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,519
that what you are doing is worthwhile.

304
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,159
Collaborating with leaders on that level,

305
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,639
can you tell us, you know, how you achieved that success?

306
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,340
Yeah.

307
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,580
So, I think what really, I was like many scientists

308
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,500
living off government grants, one grant at a time,

309
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,919
which, you know, it's highly competitive to get

310
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,440
and the money is not very large.

311
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,740
And I sort of liken my job to being a professional beggar.

312
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,659
And so, you know, I really spend a lot of my time

313
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,759
with my handout asking people for money to keep

314
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,340
the whole thing going and a lot of my time.

315
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,340
And so, we're always scanning for opportunities.

316
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,120
And when the Gates Foundation,

317
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,500
came around with a competition they announced globally,

318
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,379
which was they had 14 big questions

319
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,860
that they wanted to get addressed

320
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,139
and they were looking for solutions for them.

321
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,440
And one of them was mosquito transmitted diseases.

322
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,419
And we thought, you know, okay, this fits us

323
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,679
and put the application in or a letter of intent in.

324
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,659
And we ended up in a competition

325
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,320
with about 1,700 other scientists around the world.

326
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,320
And we were lucky enough to make it to the top 40.

327
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,460
And that placement in the top 40 got us about

328
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,320
16,000 scientists.

329
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,379
So, that's about 6 million US dollars in funding,

330
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,460
which for me at the time was like winning the lottery.

331
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,460
And, you know, I'd never received that much money in a grant.

332
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,340
My usual grant sizes were maybe 200,000 to 300,000,

333
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,399
if I was lucky.

334
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,159
And so, suddenly in 2004 to receive that money

335
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,720
from the Gates Foundation was a huge boost to our program.

336
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,000
But also, you know, opened up doors for me as well,

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,740
being, you know, some of the big brands, if you like,

338
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,580
in the global health,

339
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,960
like the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation, you know,

340
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,620
very well known and very connected.

341
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,360
And so, it connects you to other people and other opportunities,

342
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,080
if you like.

343
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,379
And so, yeah, it's been a very fortunate ride

344
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,820
from that point of view to be able to interact

345
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,179
with people from those foundations.

346
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,079
And for us, you know, we're incredibly grateful

347
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,339
for what that funding that we've received has allowed us

348
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,420
to achieve, not just the Gates Foundation,

349
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,339
but Wellcome Trust, Gillespie family,

350
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,339
as you mentioned, Macquarie Bank, McKenzie Scott.

351
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,180
Various other donors have really, really helped us get

352
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,859
to where we needed to get to.

353
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,440
And so, we're hugely grateful for them.

354
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,779
I love hearing that in the not-for-profit space as well,

355
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,619
Professor O'Neill.

356
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,400
We often hear of, you know,

357
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
people get a massive business breakthrough

358
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,720
with one particular high-level, you know, client effectively,

359
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
and then the knock-on effect.

360
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,519
And clearly, that's happened for you

361
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:40,779
with the Gillespie Foundation.

362
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,019
Yeah.

363
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah.

364
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah.

365
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,319
Yeah.

366
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:42,839
And the support of the Gates Foundation

367
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,119
and Open Doors that were bigger than the initial $6 million,

368
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,420
which was obviously huge.

369
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,720
Reading some of your history in research for this,

370
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,339
and again, correct me if I'm wrong,

371
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
but in your own words, I've heard you describe yourself

372
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,440
as a naughty kid who wasn't academically focused,

373
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,099
who scrapped through year 12.

374
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,319
I mean, for people listening and think a scientist

375
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,319
is potentially going to have as big an impact

376
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,779
as anyone in a global sense for a long period of time.

377
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
I mean, is that accurate?

378
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,119
And why did you start?

379
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,859
Why did you struggle so much at school?

380
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,940
I don't know if I struggled at school,

381
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,240
but, you know, I wasn't, certainly,

382
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,839
wasn't the most brilliant student in that school.

383
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,839
And I was interested, as I think many young teenagers are,

384
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,920
about life and learning about life, not just about chemistry.

385
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,059
You know, I was, I had wide interests, I think, at the time,

386
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,000
and maybe didn't put as much attention into my schoolwork

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,460
as I probably would have if I had been a bit more mature

388
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,900
at the time.

389
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,460
And, you know, I went to university initially

390
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,480
and enjoyed the freedom that I had and the ability

391
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,900
to go out and party and, you know, failed out or dropped

392
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,960
out of my first stint at university

393
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,839
within the first six months of going.

394
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,900
And then sort of went and worked fruit picking

395
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,019
and doing different things and got, sort of got a little bit

396
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,660
more together and went back to university a bit more serious.

397
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,740
And, yeah, and then it got, I got to, found success,

398
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,859
and got more interested in it, if you like,

399
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,400
as a result of that, and paid more and more attention to it.

400
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,880
And then, you know, went all the way through university,

401
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,140
did a PhD, and then ended up going to the US

402
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,920
and got into some very good labs and to interact

403
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,059
with some very good people.

404
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,319
And, you know, it all went from there.

405
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,559
Gives hope to everyone, Professor O'Neill,

406
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,640
that you can end up achieving what you have

407
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,740
without necessarily, because as we know,

408
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,700
and we've talked to great educators on this podcast as well,

409
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,220
that, you know, perhaps the school system is,

410
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,599
needs some disruption as well.

411
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,839
It's not one size fits all.

412
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,099
I mean, you've found a way through,

413
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,980
but a lot of brilliant people don't.

414
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,079
Yeah, I think what was more important for me

415
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,539
than what I learned at school was, you know,

416
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,019
having a good sense of curiosity and perseverance and drive

417
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,559
and being willing to chase your dream.

418
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,559
And I think that in the end, you know,

419
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
kept me in good stead,

420
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,819
maybe more than what I learned in physics.

421
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:10,660
What a great life lesson.

422
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,619
It's a great lesson to share, isn't it?

423
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,700
And I want to come back and ask you about curiosity

424
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,539
in a moment.

425
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,599
I've also read that you've got a belief

426
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,839
that we need more scientists in key leadership positions

427
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,720
in government, CEO roles,

428
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,819
and a sense that if we're going to solve the big issues

429
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,599
that the planet faces, Professor O'Neill,

430
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,440
global warming and energy, et cetera,

431
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,299
that, you know, we need more science-based leaders.

432
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,900
Is that, is that real for you?

433
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,859
Yeah, yeah, it is for me.

434
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,880
You know, as a scientist,

435
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
I can appreciate some of the things

436
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,599
that are coming across the news every night

437
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,180
with regards to climate change

438
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,400
and what the future is looking for the planet.

439
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
You know, we've got large numbers,

440
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,480
very large numbers of people that need to be fed.

441
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,559
We've got an unstable climate that's changing.

442
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,039
It's going to disrupt agricultural production systems.

443
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,799
We're running out of energy.

444
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,559
We need clean energy drastically.

445
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,839
There's a huge, big issues to solve.

446
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,680
And then I look at the quality

447
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,160
of our global political leadership,

448
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,599
and, and it just, you know, it's, you know,

449
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,099
it just seems to me the problem

450
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,900
and the people that we have at the moment tasked

451
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,220
to help resolve those problems don't match up very well.

452
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,299
And I think we've, my sense would be

453
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,619
that we need a little bit more, you know,

454
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,960
a little bit louder voice for the people

455
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,039
that really understand what the problems are

456
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,920
that we're facing and where the solutions will be found.

457
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
And so I'm a strong advocate

458
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,519
for seeing more science-trained people in jobs

459
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,480
as like political leadership jobs or running countries.

460
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,720
than they currently are at the moment.

461
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
I think when you see examples of them, they do quite well.

462
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,099
And the problem is they're just not drawn in that direction.

463
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:53,700
But I think there's a job for universities

464
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,940
to be training scientists,

465
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,920
to go out and to have very broad roles,

466
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,980
not to be scientists sitting in the back room of labs,

467
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,839
toiling away, but to be running companies,

468
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,559
to be running government departments,

469
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,619
to really bring their training

470
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,140
to where it can have a broader societal impact.

471
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,599
So yeah, I feel fairly strongly about that.

472
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,160
We've got big problems in front of us.

473
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,420
Yeah, it's a brilliant thought.

474
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,200
And in a slightly different way, you know,

475
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,319
the essence of this podcast, Professor O'Neill,

476
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,500
is about capturing what great leadership looks like

477
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,220
in different contexts and seeing that really,

478
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,799
there's a big shift in leisure,

479
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,339
away from some of the challenging leaders on a global sense,

480
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,180
towards more collaborative, towards more self-reflective,

481
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,039
towards, you know, more inclusive.

482
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,119
And, you know, loving the fact, you know,

483
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,299
that if you are more inclusive as a scientist,

484
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,359
you want to collaborate and get the best outcomes.

485
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,680
You know, it's not my area,

486
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,220
but I suppose that was the essence

487
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,480
of what good science to me used to be, wasn't it?

488
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,660
Was you come up with an idea, you test that idea,

489
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,400
you debate that idea, and then out of that,

490
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
you get great breakthroughs.

491
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,559
It seems even in recent times,

492
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm getting off track here, Scott,

493
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,839
that, you know, you hear this term, I trust the science.

494
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,359
The science is like, as though there's only one answer

495
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,960
in science in recent times,

496
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,900
that it's not really a panel of experts getting together,

497
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,880
getting together to formulate that.

498
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,180
Is that a reasonable question to ask?

499
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,019
Yeah, you know, it's hard for people,

500
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:20,079
often people equate science to being something written

501
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,140
in a book that is equals truth.

502
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,160
And, but science is like a living process

503
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,119
and it's a contest, you know,

504
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,839
it's a competition between ideas and thoughts

505
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,559
that's played out through experiments over time

506
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,319
and people bringing data and convincing arguments

507
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,819
that get, you know, tested backwards and forwards

508
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:39,759
until you get a dominant view.

509
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,279
And that's the process and the beauty of science

510
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,119
and why science leads to such great breakthroughs.

511
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,880
But for the general public, it can be frustrating

512
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,559
if we're in an emergency like COVID

513
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,480
and you're hearing these different viewpoints emerging

514
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,220
and you're like, well, what's real?

515
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,400
And what is science really telling us?

516
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,440
So the scientists know what's going on.

517
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,940
And all it is, is you're seeing the scientific process

518
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,900
at work up close in real time, if you like,

519
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,019
which you don't usually do.

520
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,240
You just see the end of it,

521
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,480
which is the final result.

522
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,940
But it's a very interesting, you know,

523
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,519
enterprise science and how it leads to outcomes, you know.

524
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,500
Before I ask you a range of questions on leadership,

525
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,440
I just got this fascination and, you know,

526
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,059
talking to one of the most prominent scientists in the world,

527
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:27,039
what are you reading?

528
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,940
What are you listening to?

529
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,279
What piques your interest outside of, I suppose,

530
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,279
the day-to-day of solving mosquito-borne viruses?

531
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,819
Well, you know, I've recently moved to France

532
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,119
and my free time, you know, I've been working

533
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,859
and my free time's being spent trying to learn French

534
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,759
at the moment, not very successfully.

535
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,740
So I need to get smarter at that.

536
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,440
And so I'm actually not spending a lot of time, you know,

537
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,519
in front of reading the news.

538
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,059
I scan through the major news outlets

539
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,460
and have a look what's going on,

540
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,019
but I'm really quite busy in doing what I'm doing.

541
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,200
And for me, downtime is getting some downtime mentally.

542
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,680
And that might be spending time in my garden

543
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,900
or spending time with my honeybees.

544
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,039
Or doing things like that rather than actually getting depressed

545
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,039
watching the news.

546
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,039
Fair enough, too.

547
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,900
You know, I think, as you said before, learning French,

548
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
if you're married to a French woman,

549
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,779
it makes a fair bit of sense as a priority, too,

550
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,140
I'm assuming, in the part of the world

551
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,240
where we're talking to you today.

552
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,079
We've identified in our mind these traits

553
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,400
of what great leadership looks like in different contexts.

554
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,559
And I'm fascinated to hear it from your scientific point of view.

555
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,559
But we think all great leadership,

556
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,279
at the moment, Professor O'Neill,

557
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,740
starts with self-leadership and this idea

558
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
that you need a sense of self-leadership.

559
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,119
Does that resonate with you?

560
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,740
Yeah, I think to a point that you need to be together yourself

561
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,380
in order to have other people with you.

562
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,839
I don't think if you're not together yourself,

563
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,799
then people are naturally suspicious, I think,

564
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:04,000
and less willing to go with you on a big adventure.

565
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,059
But yeah, I'm okay with that.

566
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:08,559
I agree with you.

567
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,559
Yeah.

568
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,099
So when you say be together, you mean if you're not...

569
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,240
That you're coherent, that you're organized,

570
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,660
that you have a clear direction and that you're able to express clarity

571
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,519
around an ambition and a goal that it looks achievable

572
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,400
and exciting to be part of.

573
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,240
I think that's all part of what's required.

574
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Yeah.

575
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Yeah, brilliant.

576
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Makes perfect sense.

577
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,920
We see leaders are really conscious about how they go

578
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,279
about positively impacting others in their environment.

579
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,279
And your program is about world impact on a global scale.

580
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,940
But day-to-day, when you're in the lab,

581
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,279
and are you conscious about how you impact others

582
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,279
that you work with on a day-to-day basis?

583
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:50,880
Yeah, sure.

584
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,160
I think you've always got a thousand sets of eyeballs on you,

585
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,440
or it feels that way.

586
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,559
And everything you do, people are noting one way or another.

587
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,160
So you sort of have to...

588
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,440
You're living the example of what you want.

589
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,279
And so you have to be fully committed to it,

590
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,240
and living and breathing it yourself in order for people

591
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,880
to sense the authenticity of that and to buy into it, I agree.

592
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,519
We heard a bit of your vision before about scaling the ability

593
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,779
to 500 million people in tropical areas around the globe,

594
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,880
around eliminating mosquito-borne viruses and dengue fever.

595
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,460
I mean, how have you gone about creating a vision like that

596
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,859
and then sharing your vision?

597
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,680
Have you been systematic about that?

598
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Yeah.

599
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Well, we've been talking, you know, with colleagues.

600
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,079
Yeah.

601
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,079
We've had clear points, like the one of 500 million people protected

602
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:46,000
for a number of years now, and we, you know, we have a clear...

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Our vision, if you like, is packaged down into key points,

604
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,200
which we are communicating regularly, internally, externally,

605
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,279
to different audiences.

606
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,039
And, you know, we need to get to that point.

607
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,960
We have to really bring governments along with us,

608
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,200
and some governments in countries that have a lot

609
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,519
of difficulties and challenges in poor areas of the world.

610
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,819
And there's a whole range of challenges associated with being able

611
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:20,519
to communicate effectively as foreigners into countries to be able

612
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,579
to bring technology that could help solve problems in countries

613
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,420
that have many, many problems and many issues to deal with.

614
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,200
This is just one of many.

615
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,000
And so, you know, there's a whole lot of challenges around the community,

616
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,440
the communication of what's required to get the buy-in and to build the demand.

617
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,759
You'd think that just having a great solution, you know, well, that's it, isn't it?

618
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,079
Don't you just, you know, dust off your hands, go to your honeybee, sit back,

619
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,880
kick back, and open a beer, and wash your cricket or something.

620
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,799
But no, it doesn't roll by itself.

621
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,440
And so, you've got to be in there actively pushing and working in order

622
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,559
to build the demand that will see it's finally successful and being able

623
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,799
to help the maximum number of people.

624
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,319
Yeah, it's a fascinating point.

625
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,940
You would think you would have the case study in Australia or North Queensland

626
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,940
and say, here is irrefutable evidence of dengue fever effectively being eliminated.

627
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, you would imagine that that would be not a hard thing to sell, would you?

628
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,240
But clearly...

629
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,880
Yeah, not a hard thing to sell or the endpoint of your journey.

630
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,819
You know, for many scientists, that's the endpoint.

631
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,200
But for us, it was never going to be enough because, you know,

632
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,920
because there are so many other things that are having to be dealt with,

633
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,759
problems around the world and worthy issues grabbing people's attention.

634
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,940
It's, you know, the challenge doesn't end.

635
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,119
You have to keep going out there and showing people the benefit and how it's working

636
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,799
and how it could benefit other communities.

637
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,700
And so, yeah, the work continues.

638
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,759
If our goal is really not about the discovery, our goal is about having the impact.

639
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,180
And I think that's probably what separates us from...

640
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,299
You know, the goal is great, you know, getting to the point, getting to the summit is great,

641
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,299
but it's not enough.

642
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,259
You know, it doesn't get the impact.

643
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,900
And so, we're all about getting the impact.

644
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,099
We heard you mention curiosity before, Scott.

645
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,440
It's something that probably got you through, you know, schooling and that was the gift

646
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,640
that kept your mind, I suppose, open when, you know, you were, as you said, had a range

647
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,920
of things you're interested in.

648
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,920
We see leaders are really conscious of curiosity as a dimension.

649
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,480
And then through that, they approach their own learning and development.

650
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Does that statement resonate with you around curiosity?

651
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah.

652
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Yeah, sure.

653
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm naturally a curious person and, you know, I'm always hungry to be learning things.

654
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,519
And if I'm not learning something, I'm feeling, you know, it's like I need to get up and exercise

655
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,519
or something.

656
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,039
I need to exercise my brain, if you like, by learning things.

657
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,140
So, luckily now, I've just shifted countries.

658
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,019
I've got a whole lot of learning opportunities in front of me to keep me sane and a little

659
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,019
bit more focused.

660
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:05,819
Yeah.

661
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,299
I'm a little bit occupied learning new language and culture, but yeah, I have to be, I'm very

662
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:12,299
curious driven.

663
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:18,559
I want to know about everything and then I, yeah, I can't help myself really about it.

664
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,160
It's part of my, you know, workings.

665
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,680
I just have to scratch that itch, you know, and so I'm out there learning about stuff.

666
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Yeah.

667
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Curious about everything.

668
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Yeah.

669
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
It's brilliant.

670
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
I love hearing the way you articulate.

671
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Communicating with clarity for leaders is a dimension that's pretty common and you mentioned

672
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
it.

673
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,779
I know the end point you would think might have been making this work, but to keep communicating

674
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:45,039
the importance to have the impact you're talking about, have you gone about communicating

675
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,039
with clarity?

676
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:52,500
You know, I think that's something that we all see, I think, is of huge importance and

677
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,140
something that we practice, you know, continuously practicing to try and get better at and take

678
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,059
advice from professionals in the area.

679
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,059
But I think for me, you know.

680
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,059
Yeah.

681
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:10,539
I think that the key for good communication is authenticity and, you know, people can

682
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,119
smell it, you know.

683
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,720
People can smell when you're bullshitting and, you know, I think we've all got a bullshit

684
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:25,559
detector in us and I think when you don't make that needle move and people can see that

685
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:32,559
what you're saying is you're delivering with authenticity and it's transparent and I think

686
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,319
it's much easier to build trust with people.

687
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,559
And trust is the key element that then allows things to happen.

688
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:48,140
And so for me, communication is about the elegance of simplicity wherever possible and

689
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:54,099
the importance of authenticity and being able to communicate with clarity in a simple way

690
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,099
that's truthful.

691
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,099
Yeah.

692
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,099
Brilliantly said.

693
00:32:57,099 --> 00:33:02,759
I love the way you said that the elegance of simplicity with authenticity, it resonates

694
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,200
so strongly.

695
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,160
And the way you're communicating today, collaboration more important we think for leaders than ever

696
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,359
before and really seek it out.

697
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,319
How important has collaboration been for you?

698
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,319
Oh, critically important.

699
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,240
You know, I've always, you know, we've only gotten to where we have because we've been

700
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,660
a group of people.

701
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,480
It's not one individual.

702
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,299
Often I stand out the front, you know, because I'm the spokesperson, the leader or whatever.

703
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,440
But, you know, it's a group effort, has always been a team and a group effort from all the

704
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,200
way.

705
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,539
The team changes and the expertise in the team changes depending on what are the huge

706
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:41,039
problems we have at the time.

707
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:48,099
But it's always that notion of it's a collective effort and it has to be.

708
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:56,240
And so getting and attracting and retaining and getting the input of highly skilled professionals

709
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,200
in all sorts of different areas, not just scientists, but all sorts of different areas,

710
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,160
people that know how to engage communities, communication specialists.

711
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,119
People that understand government financing, you know, we've got a whole lot of specialists

712
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,539
in our group and each contributes very importantly.

713
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:18,420
And so, yeah, this thing was never going to fly if it was just going to be a single effort

714
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
of a single individual.

715
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,619
It was going nowhere from the beginning.

716
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:29,000
And so, yeah, that's self-evident, the need for that, for a team and having that diverse

717
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,440
set of skills because they're not held by any one individual.

718
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,119
The challenge then becomes managing that.

719
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,159
And making that happen smoothly with all of the interpersonal dynamics, the ego, and

720
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,380
you get a lot of good people working together, they often have strongly held views.

721
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:51,619
So navigating through the differences of opinions, et cetera, can become a bit challenging.

722
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,460
But that's all critically, in part, part of the success.

723
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,579
It is a brilliant story in every sense and maybe the ultimate story of collaboration

724
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:00,579
as you said.

725
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:04,119
To have seen this in the different communities in Brazil and through Asia.

726
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:10,820
And, you know, all parts of the world, incredible achievement in every sense of the word.

727
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,300
But asking these final two questions, Professor Scott O'Neill, to a range of different leaders

728
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,539
and I'm keen to do that right now with you.

729
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:20,400
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

730
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Oh, wow.

731
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Probably this is sort of a question like, what's my favorite movie I'd like to sort

732
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,719
of reflect on to make sure I gave a really smart answer rather than the first one that

733
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,719
comes into my head.

734
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,719
But, oh, I don't know.

735
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,719
I don't know.

736
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:42,460
Who's, who's, you know, I'm going to avoid it a little bit in saying that I think it's

737
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,699
not a single individual.

738
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:49,179
I think I've learned different things off many, many people and, and rather than pin

739
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:55,860
it on a single individual, I think it's all those experiences that I've gained through

740
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:03,039
working and collaborating with so many different gifted people through my training, through

741
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,500
my university journey.

742
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,599
Through time, through my management at a university, a large Australian university

743
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,179
in an executive role there, you know, all of those experiences have helped shape me

744
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,179
in different ways.

745
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:18,699
And, and in each sort of phase, I've had different mentors and people that I looked up to, and

746
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:22,800
I'm not sure that I would label one more important than the others.

747
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,579
And, and so I'm going to skirt it in a way and say, I think it's been, you know, all

748
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:33,599
of these different individuals that have inputted into my thinking and my own evolution that

749
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,820
have been critical for me.

750
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,079
Which is a brilliant answer in, in itself, and it, most of that, and I'm, I'm, I'm having

751
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,679
a second round here in five minutes in time, but is it, is it most of that come in the

752
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:50,539
scientific community for you in terms of leadership or have you found, you know, from family to

753
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:54,000
outside influences have, have had as big an impact in?

754
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,480
Yeah, you know, I've, you know, I think our parents are always a huge influence very early

755
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
on.

756
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
They set our values.

757
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,920
They set our, you know, what's important to us as individuals.

758
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,000
And then I, you know, I can think as I've gone through in my life, there've been technical

759
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
mentors.

760
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,260
There've been people that have picked me up when I've, you know, failed so many times

761
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
in a row.

762
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
I didn't think I could keep going.

763
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,480
And people that would keep encouraging you and, um, people that would show you things

764
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,860
and people that would help you learn from failure.

765
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,460
Um, cause sometimes the failures can be rather harsh.

766
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,420
And so when you feel like you've lost the skin off your hands and your knees and your

767
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
feet altogether.

768
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,820
So at one time, like you've had an accident, you know, an accident off your, your bike

769
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,559
or something, your push bike, um, those people that can steer you away from the pain to think

770
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,500
about, okay, well, what's actually important here for you getting up and for the next step.

771
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,699
Um, but those moments are many, I think, and many individuals have contributed to that

772
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:53,699
through my journey.

773
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:56,699
And I'm, you know, extremely grateful to all those people.

774
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:00,500
The idea of collaboration for us is, uh, where we see, and it's happening in your world.

775
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
And this again, may be hard for you to.

776
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,340
Yeah.

777
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,199
And you're already collaborating with, you know, extraordinary people.

778
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,480
We mentioned, uh, you know, some of the financial support you get from the Gates foundation,

779
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,659
the Gillespie foundation, but in your mind, is there, if you could collaborate with anyone

780
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,619
in the world and it may be learning French, maybe it's another part of your brain that

781
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:19,619
you're thinking of.

782
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,039
Is there anyone that springs to mind in terms of collaboration that, uh, you'd like to connect

783
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,039
with?

784
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,420
That I haven't connected with that I would like to connect with.

785
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Um, yeah.

786
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
Yeah.

787
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,420
I'm really fascinated by people.

788
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Yeah.

789
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,679
And part of the reason that I do do well in picking teams and getting people together

790
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:44,559
is I'm inherently interested in people and, um, and I'm, I'm always fascinated, um, um,

791
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,900
in successful people, um, in whatever domain you would way that you would define success.

792
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,539
I, because I, I mentioned to you earlier, I'm a professional beggar in my job.

793
00:38:55,539 --> 00:39:01,039
And so, you know, if you're begging, you usually go to people that have money in order to beg.

794
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,219
And often people that have money have, have an interesting story, uh, associated with

795
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,219
them.

796
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:13,300
And, uh, and I'm, I get really interested in the people I interact with, um, that way.

797
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:19,300
And, um, and, um, and learn from, I hope I learn from my interactions with those people

798
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
as well.

799
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,099
Not just learn about how better to ask for money, but, uh, learn some things that are

800
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,300
important for life and about how we take our program forward as well.

801
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
And so in a way, um, my begging became, um, you know, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

802
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

803
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,159
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my begging

804
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,800
becomes like, uh, a large collection of mentors that I I'm getting around to me.

805
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Um, and, uh, are there people that, that I haven't interacted with that I would like

806
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
to?

807
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Yeah, absolutely.

808
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,719
There's many people in the world I would love to interact.

809
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,039
Um, uh.

810
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,280
That might be interested in helping us as well and what we're wanting to do.

811
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,699
But, um, um, is there an individual, you know, I've, I've met some incredibly interesting

812
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:57,699
people.

813
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,699
Bill Gates is a very interesting individual.

814
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:09,460
You know, I marvel at both his, the strength of his intellect

815
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,519
and the broad interest and the passion and drive he brings to it

816
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,719
and amazed at the criticism he takes.

817
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:20,780
And so much of it, I think, is so unfounded.

818
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,639
And he gets up and continues doing it day after day.

819
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,840
I find that fascinating.

820
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
People like that fascinate me.

821
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,800
And so, yeah, they're sure there are plenty, would I name them.

822
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:36,699
You know, I'm interested in political leaders.

823
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,760
I'm interested in leaders who are able to span beyond countries,

824
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,460
people that have impact, you know, people that work in organisations

825
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,840
like the World Health Organisation.

826
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,099
I have huge respect for them to see what they do

827
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,300
and are able to achieve very complex geopolitical context there.

828
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,059
And so, yeah, there are many people.

829
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,579
So, look, I feel like I'm letting you down here

830
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,079
on these last two questions being a slippery eel.

831
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:11,920
But I'm thinking about it as I'm speaking to you.

832
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:16,159
And, yeah, I could give you a list, but I don't have it in my back pocket.

833
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,460
And I'm not sure.

834
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,199
You know, often to me as well, it's not planned to the point

835
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,920
that I go out and seek out individuals.

836
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,780
They just seem to come to me.

837
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,460
It's through my other, what I do.

838
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,019
And so, you know, I'm always looking forward to the opportunity

839
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,360
of meeting people and learning from people.

840
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,860
Well, I've loved seeing you shift in your chair

841
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,039
just slightly a little bit there, Professor O'Neill, at the end.

842
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,960
And, you know, someone did ask me these same questions back

843
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,460
and I was equally uncomfortable and I feel the same way.

844
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,579
It has been a great privilege to me to, you know,

845
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:54,280
as someone who hasn't got any scientific DNA at all or background,

846
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,539
I'm fascinated by the way your brain works

847
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:57,539
and equally your language.

848
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,860
You learn so much, don't you, from diversity and other people

849
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,840
in different areas.

850
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,599
And today it has been an incredibly enlightening discussion.

851
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,019
And you zoom out to me again and you're thinking, you know,

852
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,800
an Australian scientist is going to, you know,

853
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,539
already is on a global scale, solve a problem that causes

854
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,599
so much hardship, dengue fever.

855
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,159
And we mentioned yellow fever and Zika.

856
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,179
And there was another virus I'm not mentioning

857
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:20,500
because I can't say their names.

858
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,219
Quite a name, chikungunya, Zika, dengue, yellow fever,

859
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,559
my aura, the list goes on.

860
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,780
Yeah, we're lucky to be able to control it.

861
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,739
We're lucky to be able to control many diseases

862
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,519
with the one intervention, yeah.

863
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,059
It is an amazing story of ingenuity and resilience

864
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,559
and leadership in every sense.

865
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,599
And I'm really honoured that you were prepared

866
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,519
to take some time out to share the story with me today.

867
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:41,179
Thanks so much.

868
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:45,059
And I look forward to seeing it scale up to 500 million people

869
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,179
over the next decade.

870
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,039
Thanks again for your time.

871
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,840
Thanks, Luke.

872
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,639
I appreciate it.

873
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,570
