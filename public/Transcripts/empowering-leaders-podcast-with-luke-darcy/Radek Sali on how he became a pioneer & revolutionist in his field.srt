00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:33,670
as he calls them, learning growth, improvement opportunities. He's an incredible leader and a

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,109
health benefits of sleep and sleeping well are, and to sleep on the best NASA-approved bedding

17
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,069
in the world. It is a decision, I guarantee you, that will change your life for the good.

18
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,299
Ruddick Sally is one of Australia's most

19
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:33,459
successful businessmen, and he's a great leader in the world.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,459
He's a successful business people and a serial entrepreneur in the health and wellness sector.

21
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:42,060
He revolutionized the Swiss wellness group, pioneering the use of brand ambassadors

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,019
before helping to negotiate the sale of Swiss for $1.7 billion. The positive work culture created

23
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:54,120
at Swiss under Ruddick, the CEO, saw the company recognized in 2015 and 16 as the best place to

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,640
work in Australia. Ruddick used some of the proceeds of the sale to set up Light Warrior,

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,939
an investment group committed to creating shared value by investing in businesses,

26
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,780
that are socially responsible and environmentally conscious. He's a past GQ entrepreneur of the year,

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,080
CEO in residence at Melbourne University, and an honorary alumni at La Trobe University.

28
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,360
Ruddick, it's always great to see you. It's a life full of great joy and success by the sounds of it.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,860
It's only just the beginning. It's a great apprenticeship. So much more to do.

30
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,039
So thanks for having us today.

31
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:31,719
Well, can I start with the sale of the Swiss Vitamins Group? It was to a Hong Kong-listed

32
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:32,699
entity.

33
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,319
It's still one of the biggest ever private company transactions

34
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,000
in Australian corporate history. You're the CEO. You're a big part of the ownership group. It is a

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,419
great success story. Can you tell us a bit about how you became part of that world?

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,879
Yeah, so I was very lucky or fortunate to have been born into a family where I've,

37
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,599
my father's a professor of surgery and my mother's a medical scientist. And dad was one of the first

38
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,219
people to talk about diet causing disease in traditional medicine. So I was very lucky to have

39
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,039
been born in traditional medical circles. And that was back in the 70s. And so he was laughed at back

40
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,319
then. And I was born in the 70s. So I grew up with that as a background. And it took 20 years for his

41
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,819
work to be published in British Medical Journal. And now when we look back on the fact that, you

42
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,020
know, people were laughing at diet causing disease, it's kind of laughable that people were thinking

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,560
that way. But he got a seriously hard time. So dad would lecture at home about, you know, his work

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
and how important it was.

45
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,819
It was. And mum would read the blood of his patients to make sure they had all of the right

46
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:43,520
nutrition to fight whatever condition that they were preparing to fight. Because, you know, it

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,699
makes us so much sense to be as healthy as we possibly can be to deal with whatever medical

48
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,860
condition that we kind of face. And so a lot of these intuitive things that made sense back then

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,500
needed science to support it. And, you know, the natural progression would have made to go down the

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,240
medical path.

51
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:10,639
Well, that really turned me off and kind of it was kind of it switched this entrepreneurial side on in

52
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,500
me is how you can beat the system and how you can make the system work in a better way and more

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,100
inclusive of all. And Swiss was probably the first incarnation of that, although I did a wonderful

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,180
apprenticeship at a place called Village Roadshow where I got to work globally with them, start in

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,259
the candy bar and work my way up into senior management roles there.

56
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,180
But.

57
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,139
But by the by the grand old age of 27, I kind of worked out that I wasn't going to be the CEO of

58
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,139
Village Roadshow in the near term future that had just had a 30 year old CEO who didn't work out.

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,839
And I thought, oh, gee, now my time's done.

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,259
They're not going to appoint me.

61
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,620
So they appointed some some guy that was almost 50 from a toilet paper background.

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,720
And so it was time for me to to go and do something else.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,740
And in our network, we had all these interesting, wonderful people that my father knew of.

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,779
And one of those was Michael Saba.

65
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,899
He was the managing director of Swiss at the time.

66
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,699
And and dad had had connections with all these people in nutrition because he wanted to make

67
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,459
sure that whatever he recommended his patients was always the best of quality.

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,100
He actually never had a financial deal with Swiss until I came on board a little later

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,500
and brought him in as a consultant to support us.

70
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,819
He just did it out of the goodness of his heart to make sure that when he was recommending

71
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,959
something for his patients, it had the best quality ingredients.

72
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,720
And and Swiss was one of those groups.

73
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:32,540
He was working with.

74
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,459
So we had a relationship there and and and timing was right.

75
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,720
They had approached me a couple of times a year or two before that.

76
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,779
And I wanted to stick with what we were doing.

77
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,300
And I came across and joined Swiss and slowly bought into the business and the organization.

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,680
And, you know, we had an extraordinary product to start with.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,259
And men's and women's multivitamin were turning about 12, 13 million turnover.

80
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,139
And there was a great culture.

81
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,639
My two business partners are just extraordinary individuals.

82
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,519
Really kind.

83
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,339
And people that really put our people first.

84
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:09,339
So that gave me a really good basis, a good foundation to build a great business from there.

85
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:18,319
Your dad, Professor Avani Sully, as you described, the founding father in lots of ways of integrated medicine.

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,000
Brilliant man.

87
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,420
I have enjoyed spending some time with with him and ahead of his time in every sense.

88
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,259
As you described, you're a child of the 70s.

89
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,279
And I can imagine those dinner party conversations where your dad was really ahead of his time.

90
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:47,139
And for those, this integrated medicine is taking the best of Western approach and surgery and but integrating it with things like acupuncture or yoga that has got evidence base around genuinely supporting better health and a better sense of well-being.

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
And I'm not surprised to hear you say that was a formative part of your world growing up.

92
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,899
Your dad's still in the office at NIM, the National Integrated Medicine.

93
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,620
So you're on the board of NIM.

94
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,259
It has shaped your life.

95
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,740
Hasn't it?

96
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,379
When you look at what you do still and what you did then, it's it's fascinating that's come out in the entrepreneurial space.

97
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,279
But it was probably always going to be there, wasn't it?

98
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,879
Yeah, dad's so unique.

99
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,420
I mean, he works harder than he still works harder than I've ever worked in his 80s.

100
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,439
So I just don't know how he does it.

101
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,560
He's a great inspiration and he just lives and breathes health.

102
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,360
And, you know, that's his passion.

103
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,560
He loves talking about it.

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,459
And and that's why he does it every day.

105
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,240
And I love the way you spoke about.

106
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,399
You know, you saw he had to push through.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,740
And I love his patience when you talk to him.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,160
He understands the system and the interest in it.

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,199
And he's got this incredible way of acknowledging it, but saying we can still still do good.

110
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:53,300
I mean, you obviously saw the hardship when people are discrediting you and putting aside stuff that would have helped so many people early.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,800
As you said, the thought that your food doesn't affect your health.

112
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,720
That's what they're arguing against effectively at the time.

113
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,199
But somewhere in your mind, you went, all right, I can.

114
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,060
I can do this without trying to change the system.

115
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,199
I'm going to have an impact in a different way.

116
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,600
Was that a really conscious thing, as you said?

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,220
I think so.

118
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,199
I mean, I'm very intuitive and I like to follow where my heart sends me and where my passion is.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,939
And and definitely a lot of roads were leading in that direction.

120
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:31,160
And to come back to it, it prepared for prepared me for a lot of the inertia we would face as an organisation down the path as we kind of went.

121
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:49,460
From being as an industry when I kind of started, it was it was it was kind of the hairy hippie hippies or there was kind of product for IBS and UTIs, irritable bowel syndrome or or urinary tract infections and and kind of not barbecue speak.

122
00:08:49,460 --> 00:09:00,399
And I'd come from Village Roadshow where every week we had new movies, great new talent to talk about, you know, what's Brad Pitt's new movie or or what's Angelina Jolie up to?

123
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,179
And and.

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
And, you know, when's the next premiere?

125
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,179
Can I come along?

126
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:17,179
And then I suddenly would go to barbecues and tell people I work at Swiss and I'd say, well, the embassy and then I'd say no vitamins and I'd quickly change the subject because I'd be worried I'd be talking about the UTI or IBS and kind of.

127
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:25,179
And so for me, it became quite, quite obvious that there was a real opportunity to kind of create a lifestyle product.

128
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,899
And there was one product that was doing really, really well, which was called Centrum.

129
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,059
And they had an ambassador.

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,419
They're called Rob DeCostella, who is a marathon runner that won some medals in the Commonwealth Games and and and a great talent.

131
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:47,740
And and and I'd walk into stores and there'd be this wall of Centrum product and I'd ask them about, you know, why do you give so much space to that product?

132
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:54,340
And they would tell me, oh, because it's because of the I'd say no.

133
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,820
Why? And I'd suggest that they get the best margin out of out of that that brand.

134
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,840
And I'd say, no, it's actually the worst margin in the category.

135
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,159
Why?

136
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,419
And they'd go, I guess, why do you range it so much?

137
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,600
Well, they advertise 52 weeks of the year and they've got this great point of sale with Rob DeCostella.

138
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,220
And interestingly enough, you know, in that barbecue speak, the occasional person would say, yeah, no, no, I take Centrum.

139
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,600
And I'd say, why? Because of Rob DeCostella.

140
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,940
And so we looked at our kind of Swiss world and and I would ask people why they arranged that product in a health food store or pharmacy.

141
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,860
And and they would say, you know, Swiss sells itself.

142
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,679
And I go, maybe we're onto something here.

143
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,080
We've got a premium product.

144
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,320
That's retaining customers.

145
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,879
And we would we research this later on a number of years later on.

146
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,799
And we found we had the highest retention in the category.

147
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,440
Seventy percent of people who would try a brand would retain taking Swiss after after trying it.

148
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:56,460
So the fundamentals of marketing is that if you've got a great product, which goes back to, again, having people like my father involved in advising on the raw materials, the nutrition and making sure the science was right.

149
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,259
So it would make a noticeable difference.

150
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,179
So if you've got a great product, the fundamentals of marketing.

151
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,919
If you invest in it, you know, you're going to you're going to open up a bigger consumer base.

152
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:14,080
So I'd look in those pharmacies and you look over to the perfume section and all the cosmetic section that beautifully up.

153
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:19,519
They had all these great people that were ambassadors or advertising their products.

154
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:26,200
And as I said, Rob DeCostella was a great sports person.

155
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,019
You know, there was an opportunity to be a bit more dynamic.

156
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,120
And so Ricky Ponting, when you took the.

157
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,419
The product and I reached out to him and said, how would you feel about doing a Swiss campaign?

158
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,279
And we couldn't afford 52 weeks of the TV.

159
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,860
We could only afford sponsoring the cricket.

160
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,139
And that's what we did.

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,720
We advertised in the cricket with the personality and off off it went from there.

162
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,399
All the way to Nicole Kidman as a as a brand ambassador, as a pioneer.

163
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,340
And I wasn't I knew the story and we all saw it.

164
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,860
We suddenly saw Swiss everywhere and and it worked.

165
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
It became, you know, you know, in the sporting.

166
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:12,200
World product and you created that sense that, you know, it was aspirational and you wanted to take vitamins and made them, you know, something to behold.

167
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,980
As you said, like every, you know, success story.

168
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
That's one thing to have the play.

169
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,340
I mean, can you tell us, you know, you put Nicole Kidman on the whiteboard.

170
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,360
It's one thing to do that.

171
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:27,779
It's another thing to convince, you know, a Hollywood A grade superstar to to to join the product.

172
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,200
Was that challenging?

173
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,080
Well, I think.

174
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,980
We had a few things work out really well for us.

175
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,559
Whilst all of this was going on and kind of we created this aspirational brand piece in the health category.

176
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,600
What also became quite clear to us is is health became one of the few things you could continue to boast about.

177
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,840
And we all talk about still to this day, the detox program, the marathon we're training for the gym program.

178
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,279
You know, it's one of those few things that we can still keep, you know, say, hey, look at me.

179
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm doing this to our friends without people going.

180
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,480
You got to pull your head in there, buddy.

181
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:11,559
So so we rode that kind of wave of this kind of transformation of wellness being something that everyone wanted to have a part of.

182
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,139
And it would be OK to kind of talk about openly.

183
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,980
So we had all these successful people working with us.

184
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:25,480
And by the time we got to Nicole, it was around 300 different ambassadors of shapes and sizes and organizations that we'd work with.

185
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,159
So the pitch to Nicole was, you know, it's the first Australian company that she'd ever got behind.

186
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,179
And she'd be very, very careful with her brand.

187
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,279
Timing just felt very right for all parties.

188
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,960
And you have to get timing right.

189
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,240
And there was a sense that we would do the right thing by her.

190
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,820
And this is much as important for us for her to do the right thing for us.

191
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,820
And so, yeah, it was a wildly difficult deal to get done.

192
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,720
And Hollywood managers are excruciatingly challenging at the best of times.

193
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,779
And I used to make the joke of.

194
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,279
While we're doing the deal, I better just check if I've still got my wedding ring on my finger.

195
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:20,779
But we got there in the end with a lot of patience and not with this kind of positive culture that we had as an organization would always turn negative things into challenges rather than the word problem didn't exist in our business.

196
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:28,440
So any time something that was a bit of a challenge that came up like with the Nicole contracts that felt insurmountable would say, well, this is a challenge.

197
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,659
And let's turn it into a positive.

198
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,179
And let's work out how we work.

199
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:37,559
And generally, when you can kind of speak human to human, you can get there.

200
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,820
And thankfully, we got there after about a year of negotiations.

201
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,740
A year, full 12 months.

202
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,460
That's interesting.

203
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,059
It's good to.

204
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,740
I love having the opportunity to do this.

205
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,779
You know, people listen to that story here, the bio and you go straight from Village Road.

206
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,639
So you sell the business for one point seven billion dollars.

207
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,440
You know how what a great path that was.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm sure you've got 400 stories of twists and turns and ups and downs.

209
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,399
And as you said, turning problems in into solutions.

210
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,799
I understand, you know, when you took on the US market, that came with a set of challenges as well.

211
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:16,519
Tell us about your leadership in those situations where, you know, there were moments where, you know, you had some pretty big hurdles to jump.

212
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:17,740
Yeah.

213
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,460
So, yeah, I was in Swiss for 12 years.

214
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:30,639
So the journey now we really kind of played around with this formula of growth and then product growth as well that supported that for the sort of first.

215
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,299
Three years.

216
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:40,580
And then we worked out what we call that flywheel and this flywheel of kind of marketing and personality event.

217
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:52,600
And then, you know, pre-selling that into a retailer to ensure the cost of the marketing with the sale of the product in and then the product selling through and that creating competitive tension.

218
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,679
Because if we were doing a spring racing carnival promotion with Chemist Warehouse, you know,

219
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,639
the price line would get on the phone and say, we want to do the next promotion because that was extraordinary.

220
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,559
We got great cut through.

221
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:15,980
So we'd go and work with them on the tennis or the Olympics for Woolworths and then Nicole Kidman for back to Chemist Warehouse or whoever else was kind of in the mix.

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,580
So you get the best deal and the best product selling and then the best support from those stores to ensure best sell through.

223
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:28,360
And so that momentum built and kind of created this kind of flywheel.

224
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,620
But it would go wrong.

225
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,139
And that's when you learn most.

226
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,659
We would actually call it an LGI moment.

227
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:42,080
We had language in our business that kind of created our framework for our values and our business planning was really, really important.

228
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:47,840
But our culture planning and the language around our culture would be reviewed as regularly as our business plans.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,220
And we'd had KPIs related to business performance, but also culture performance.

230
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,940
And, you know, you rarely hear me talk about I.

231
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,559
We talk about we as a team.

232
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,139
And, you know, unless I've made an error.

233
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,539
And I would call out my errors quite regularly.

234
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,700
I should have been fired probably three times over.

235
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,180
And I would talk about that with the team so we could all learn from that.

236
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,160
And it was okay to talk about when something went wrong because then you could break it apart and go, okay, what should we have got right and what could we have done better?

237
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,740
And a classic example was launching in the U.S.

238
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:27,519
We had Ellen DeGeneres and her TV show coming out to Australia, thankfully, and Nicole Kidman featuring on that show to launch.

239
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,980
And we gave away everyone.

240
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,940
We had a seat in the audience to come to Australia to enjoy the Ellen show and spend a week in Australia and in L.A. there.

241
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:38,819
And it kicked off.

242
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,539
But when I flew in, I was really excited about that.

243
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,119
But we got into our retailers.

244
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,460
We had 30,000 retailers supporting us.

245
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,160
And they all told us that you don't have to worry.

246
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,619
We're going to arrange your products.

247
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,420
You don't need a merchandise.

248
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,980
You don't need a field sales force.

249
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,019
And so I walked into the Walgreens stores and they had these great posters up with Nicole Kidman and Ellen DeGeneres and a Swiss product.

250
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,640
But the product just wasn't.

251
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,319
It was down in the bottom corner, like one product.

252
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,740
There was no merchandising.

253
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,579
I just said to the team, we're gone here.

254
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,680
We're going to have to do something pretty rapidly.

255
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,000
And thankfully, we got on board with our business partners at Swiss.

256
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,400
I mean, sorry, at Swiss.

257
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:17,279
I'm at Chemist Warehouse.

258
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,640
And we did a deal where we did an exclusive partnership with them for Ellen DeGeneres.

259
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:28,559
They agreed to buy a certain amount of stock, which was the difference of us going bankrupt or not.

260
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,039
And.

261
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,519
That promotion was absolutely extraordinary and worked for all of us.

262
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,980
And out of that was the kind of basis for what we call Project Gold, which is how we exploded into China.

263
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,559
So you mentioned an LGI moment.

264
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,359
That's a big one, isn't it?

265
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,559
You're literally facing bankruptcy.

266
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,559
You're launching the US and you walked into a store and gone, we're in real trouble here.

267
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,059
This is a moment to find that pathway.

268
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,259
And the Chemist Warehouse story was a great partnership for you in the end.

269
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,380
And it must have been some hairy moments at that.

270
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,420
And what does an LGI moment mean?

271
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,599
Well, it's a learn, grow and improve moment.

272
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,240
So it's something our production manager once said in a production meeting when we were talking about manufacturing.

273
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,740
And he was from Kazakhstan.

274
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,119
And he had a wonderful accent.

275
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,079
And we were running through what had gone right and what had not gone so well.

276
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,160
And he said, yes, yes, this is a learn, grow and improve moment.

277
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:29,660
And from that moment onward, we call it the LGI.

278
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,119
And so rather than when someone said, you know, you've got something wrong, you know, we've got to talk about it.

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,099
You know, immediately then you laughed, as I said, LGI.

280
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,319
And so whenever something went wrong in our business, rather than say, hey, you've got that wrong, we'd say, hey, it's an LGI.

281
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,900
So we'd lighten up the moment and then LA would unpack it and talk about it and have a bit of humour that goes with it to make it a bit easier.

282
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,380
There's a great bit of wisdom in that, isn't it?

283
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,359
Because so many places, you know, the old school of leadership rhetoric is that you don't show weakness or if you've made a mistake,

284
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,359
you're going to let the time.

285
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
You're going to let the team down.

286
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:06,960
And we know how limiting that is when you sort of celebrate the moments to grow.

287
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,819
I mean, it's easier said than done, isn't it, when you put your hand up.

288
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,000
But clearly, you've obviously seen that that's the only way to work.

289
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,359
And is it something that has continued on throughout the life of you that you've been able to just own those moments?

290
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,319
I absolutely have to.

291
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,640
I mean, we're all human.

292
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,720
We make errors.

293
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
And I think we've gone away from this period where we survived.

294
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,059
We put on the tie.

295
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,640
And we're doing it, you know, we're doing the work, the business of work for our family.

296
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We've actually got to do it for a bigger cause.

297
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,400
We've got to do it for society.

298
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,779
And that's linked back to our family.

299
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,140
And capitalism plays such a huge part in our society.

300
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,000
And that partnership with democracy is so essential for it to work.

301
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,980
You know, four out of five of us work in businesses and one out of five are in government.

302
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,579
And so, you know, we can't wait for government to.

303
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,000
We can't wait for government to solve issues in society.

304
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,140
And so part of what we can do as business leaders is make our workplaces the best place to be.

305
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:20,640
And that's what I lose sleep about is how people feel coming to work with me and working on whatever they do and making sure that they have purpose and feel truly engaged and doing what they love.

306
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:27,640
And also, you know, feel free to be open about where they've fallen over and where they need to improve.

307
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,660
And I just think of the best.

308
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,319
The best relationships in my life, you know, like the one I have currently with my wife, we challenge each other.

309
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,680
We bring out the best with each other.

310
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,859
We're honest with each other.

311
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,339
And that's great.

312
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,079
And, yeah, we irritate each other, but we talk about it and we become better of it.

313
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,000
And I think of the reverse, which, you know, I reckon, you know, 80 to a bit less than I used to say 90 percent.

314
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,599
Now I reckon it's about 80 to 70 percent of people are in that bad relationship we've all had where, you know, I had one of these girlfriends in the past.

315
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:05,599
When I broke up with her, everyone said, oh, you know, you should have broken up with her years ago and you weren't good for each other and she wasn't good.

316
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,000
It was the same poor thing for her.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,599
I wasn't good for her either and we're both much better people broken up.

318
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:28,380
But we're all in this kind of, you know, a lot of us are in these workplaces where we feel trepidation about having to go into work and we feel down about it and, you know, that's, you know, really as us business leaders, we're not doing our bit for society and making this kind of form of work.

319
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,400
I think there's a lot of value in that.

320
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,500
But I think it's really important to have that kind of freedom that we have, work to its best and optimum.

321
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
So I'm obsessed by sharing that story and hoping others will come along for that journey.

322
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
And it is a brilliant thing to share, Radag.

323
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I appreciate you doing that, because you're right, we spend such a significant period of our time at work and when workplaces are unhappy, and often that is the case because someone's in a leadership role, you know, I give people the better of the doubt that, you know, not always malicious but lacking in the language that you just had around leadership.

324
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,680
around being obsessed with making it a place where people can make mistakes, where they are

325
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,019
happy, where they are full of purpose, and when they can grow. I mean, clearly, Swiss was that.

326
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:13,640
You said you had great partners who I know, but you went after that with that language. And we

327
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,500
know that the research says that you go home, you have a happier home life, you become better

328
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,539
parents, your health, your actual physical health improves when you work. But the bottom line is

329
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,640
the productivity of the group is better too. So it's self-serving at the same time, Ruddick,

330
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,259
but it still seems missed. I've been in so many places where you can walk in and you can tangibly

331
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,460
feel how disconnected and miserable people are in an office. You don't even have to ask a question.

332
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,160
You can actually see it in their face every single day. As you said, it's one of the great

333
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:52,119
tragedies of life, isn't it? Yeah, it's such a thing just being aware, like you're talking about,

334
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,519
that level of consciousness that we all have.

335
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:01,720
And have a capability to switch on, which I've had people laugh at or actually say to me,

336
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,019
you can't meditate your way to profit. And we would meditate twice a day. My wife and I bought

337
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:13,759
it as a gift for each other for our paper anniversary, I think we were fourth or fifth

338
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,640
year in, and said we both need it. And we got this fantastic meditation coach in who trained

339
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,519
us to meditate. And I'd always had meditation in my life. I'd always had meditation in my life.

340
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:30,299
It was my father and so forth, but I just hadn't found a method that resonated with me. And kind

341
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,660
of where I'm going with the meditation part is kind of meditation to me is like, I ask people

342
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,839
if they shower or they kind of brush their teeth every day. And they kind of, yeah, yeah. And that's

343
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,779
basic hygiene, isn't it? The other part of hygiene that we need to think about is our mind. And our

344
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:53,859
mind being engaged and ready for what is the present and the now and that person in front of

345
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,200
you. So it's not just the present and the now. It's the present and the now. And that person in

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,519
front of you. So it's not just the present and the now and that person in front of you. So it's not

347
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,759
disengaged. You know, we've all sat in meetings where you can clearly see that person is just

348
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,900
caught up in whatever garbage that copped in that last meeting and they're unpacking it in front of

349
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,519
you and it stinks. And kind of meditation makes you, I won't say kind of, meditation makes you

350
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,119
more aware of kind of what that chatter in your mind and whether you are being as present as you

351
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:24,200
can be and should be for that person. And a classic example of that is before this conversation,

352
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,299
I've had a really busy morning. Funny to think that up here in Brunswick Heads is where we enjoyed

353
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,480
the beach and having a swim. But stuff does go on and it's been back to back meetings and I go,

354
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,400
I just need my 20 minutes. I got up at 5am, the dog barking, wanted to have a drink of water. And

355
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,599
that's, she's got into the pattern of that because we go and meditate and watch the sunrise, which is

356
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:52,160
fantastic. But then, you know, by just before this, which we're on at two, I was like, oh,

357
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,140
thank goodness, I've got 30 minutes. I took my

358
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,799
breath of meditation and I'm back, you know, I can give you my all and I can be present.

359
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,720
And so, you know, we forget that as leaders that we do need to take time out to bring our best,

360
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,500
to give our all as leaders and to really listen to the people that we're speaking to.

361
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:17,720
Listening is just a, is something that is a craft that I think that we don't put enough

362
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,200
emphasis on. Yeah, brilliant to hear you talk about that. I knew you were

363
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,180
a passionate meditator.

364
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,079
And, you know, Mark Barney, who wrote a brilliant book, Ancient Wisdom for Modern

365
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:36,460
Health, and he called it a holiday for his brain, twice a day, the same technique. And I was going

366
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,099
to ask you, you grew up in a house with a forward-thinking mother and father who understood

367
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:45,559
health in a way that very few did. And you've developed, you know, with your own family,

368
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,039
meditation practice on a daily basis. What other things do you do, Radhik, that, you know, keep

369
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,039
you healthy and happy and successful? What sort of daily habits do you do?

370
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,940
Meditation clearly is the way you start your day. What other things keep you healthy?

371
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,900
Well, I think it's about setting up a routine that works for you, that you really look forward to.

372
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,079
You should love doing all of these things. I love doing the meditation. And if you don't,

373
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,599
you've got to find something that works for you. So something that you're a natural at and that

374
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,619
you kind of, you gravitate to. So it's like, it's no good if you're no good at, if you haven't got

375
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,900
basic ball skills, you're never going to be a great footballer, hey, like, so,

376
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,519
so don't bother trying to do that, even though you like the idea of becoming that. So

377
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,720
work out your wellness program to fit. So for me, and, you know, I can kind of, whenever I have

378
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,779
really stressful times in life, I make sure that I drink a whole lot less and I eat a whole lot

379
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,980
healthier, knowing that I need to be absolutely on my game. I make sure I meditate twice a day.

380
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:52,640
If I'm a little less stressed, you know, once I'm okay with, and I still crave after that second,

381
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,079
you know, I can, I can deal with once, but if I'm really stressed, I make sure that the twice

382
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:04,940
is happening. Then I'll do yoga. I do that twice a week. I work out in the gym four times a week.

383
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,740
I'm no good without a personal trainer. I need someone to keep me honest as I turn up.

384
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:14,519
And then a lot of working, a lot of personal movement and a game of golf, not worrying about

385
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,240
how the golf balls hit, but catching up with friends and, and just talking, talking about

386
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,579
things that you, you normally wouldn't talk about. Us blokes are terrible.

387
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,420
That conversation compared to females, they'll talk about, you know, a lump on their breast

388
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,900
that's formed and be very comfortable about sharing that with a friend, us guys and talking

389
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,920
about a lump somewhere they're uncomfortable about sharing, um, just doesn't come naturally.

390
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,880
So, you know, get a group of friends around you where you can be really open and honest

391
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,980
and they're really open and honest with you and keep you honest in more ways than one,

392
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,720
not only in your personal life, your business life and get to know you intimately. So make

393
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
sure that that kind of wellness schedule, um, has a lot of socially,

394
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,279
uh, you know, socially positive things happening. You know, go for a paddleboard down here.

395
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:01,759
We call it a board meeting because it's with paddleboards and it's usually a bunch of good

396
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,619
friends that we go and paddle. And we just talk as we paddle about things you otherwise

397
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,000
wouldn't talk about. So try and work out a program that allows for all those sorts of

398
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,299
things.

399
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm reminded as you're talking of, uh, a line and I will butcher this, but I think it was

400
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,240
a Gandy line saying, I've got the most, uh, uh, busy schedule today. I'm going to meditate

401
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,880
for two hours instead of one to be, uh, to be successful.

402
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,480
And, and it's the start of slowing down to be more productive. Sounds counterintuitive,

403
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,339
doesn't it? But I want to ask you about, about, sorry to cut you off there. I want to ask you

404
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,559
about, uh, you know, the, the commitment to impact investment investing and come back to that before

405
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,579
I do. I, I think this story, and I rarely ask before an interview starts to someone, do you

406
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:47,259
mind if I ask a question? And your answer was nothing is off limits. You asked me whatever

407
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:52,680
you like, and you've invested in a range of, uh, of different things with, you know, great,

408
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,700
success and impact as you do in, in lots of areas, including, uh, George Columbaris's

409
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,519
restaurant group made. And shortly after, if I, if I get the sequence right, you do

410
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,220
an audit of the business. It comes to light, the business has underpaid its employees,

411
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,980
$7.8 million or there, there about. You self-report, you go to the Fair Work Commission, you pay

412
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,440
back a hundred percent of the money, but the fallout from it, Radak, is just quite extraordinary.

413
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,339
The cancel culture, George gets canceled out of everything in life. I mean, can you tell us

414
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:31,619
about that time? For me, it's a great leadership story. In the mainstream world, it was portrayed

415
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,160
as, uh, as something very different. How, how, how did that one play out?

416
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,680
Uh, yeah, it was very challenging at the time. Not, not so challenging for me,

417
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:50,420
aside from the financial impact. Um, but, but to see over 500 employees,

418
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:57,839
lose their, their jobs in a, in a sector that, you know, as difficult as it is, you, you're

419
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:05,140
dealing with, you know, minimum wage, uh, operators. It's, it's really hard for, for people

420
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,720
working in those sorts of organizations. Um, they do shift work, um, and, and, and so, and they

421
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,700
loved working with our organization and, and we, we led from the front and, and something that was

422
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,420
right in the industry and not just in our industry.

423
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,759
It's been an issue for banks, for universities, for government. Every industry has, in some way

424
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:33,119
or another, that hires casual employees, missed the mark on paying people correctly per hour.

425
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:40,059
Now, we, we were one of the early ones to say, hey, we're getting this wrong and we want to

426
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,400
fix it and, and we want to be transparent about how we're doing it. How that was interpreted by

427
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,400
the public was, you know, really probably turned into a lobbying campaign.

428
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,539
Which I've seen many times in, in past lives. And, um, and so it was a, it was a lobbying campaign

429
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:03,099
for the union movement to, and, and they were getting traction, um, by using George's name, um,

430
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,160
as, as, as a wage thief, which is clearly not that because a thief is someone that tries to

431
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,039
steal something without calling out that, hey, they're, they're trying to make it right. Um,

432
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,619
and, and, and that, that got momentum and media momentum was with the story and the facts

433
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:19,700
suddenly, you know, while, you know, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were

434
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,420
you know, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were, we were,

435
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,200
some of it on, on the face that it wasn't great and, and processes should have been right.

436
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:33,480
Um, there was a lot that was right. And also go back to, you know, the mess that, uh, all of

437
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,099
these agreements are in. We had 60 ways you would pay, you could pay, different ways you'd pay a,

438
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:45,420
a restaurant working person. Now, most people in, in the corporate world that I come from,

439
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,059
you pay them a salary and that's it. You don't need to worry about anything above and beyond.

440
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,720
You know, we had, if they'd done this course or that course,

441
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,539
they would be paid this amount and it's five cents difference

442
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,200
and so forth.

443
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,920
You know, where was the impetus on whoever set up those agreements

444
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,420
on making it straightforward for those people being paid

445
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,259
to actually work out what they should be paid?

446
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:12,160
And I remember if I'm not paid the right amount, you know,

447
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,759
at Village Roadshow, it was really clear what I needed

448
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,759
to be paid each week.

449
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,440
And I'd call out to my employer, hey, you've missed this or that.

450
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,140
But it was near impossible for any employee to actually know

451
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,640
what they're supposed to be paid.

452
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,740
And that's why every industry has been hit by this.

453
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,000
And, you know, you've got businesses that are, and I won't name them

454
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because, you know, they shouldn't be called out for individual

455
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,839
because there's a wider issue in the why and why this has all happened

456
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,000
that needs to be solved for.

457
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,279
And so, you know, there's organisations that were underpaying people

458
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,420
$700 million, almost close to a billion dollars, a number of them,

459
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,099
and there's no individual that was called out.

460
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,759
And I just feel like that George, you know, and I think this is

461
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:00,180
a fundamental issue with Australia is that we do have casual racism going on.

462
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,259
And if it had been George Smith, it might have been a different story.

463
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:06,559
It might be controversial, but I'm calling out, as I say,

464
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,720
it was George Kalambaras.

465
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,699
He's a great fella.

466
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,920
And there are sayings that go with that that are negative

467
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,579
and have some negative connotations.

468
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,300
So I think some of that, along with all of the other things,

469
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,239
all just didn't help.

470
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,420
Yeah.

471
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,019
In that situation.

472
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,059
But what I can be very proud of is I can hold my heart on,

473
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:24,920
hand up my heart and say we did absolutely the right thing

474
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,219
in a very difficult circumstance.

475
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,079
And history will look kindly upon how we've done things.

476
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,820
And that's all you can do.

477
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,420
It will look really kindly on that.

478
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,780
And I know you don't want to mention those,

479
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,920
but it was Woolworths who underpaid three quarters of a billion dollars

480
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
only a few months later.

481
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,079
And I'm not pointing fingers there either,

482
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,719
but no one could name the CEO at the time.

483
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,920
He got his bonus.

484
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,639
He got his bonus at the end of the year and moved on.

485
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,659
And, you know, we saw, you know, the perfect storm.

486
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,860
He's an Italian fella.

487
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,960
So maybe my, he's an Italian fella to see.

488
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:03,159
Maybe my story of casual racism doesn't stack up.

489
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,579
Well, you know, with accounting departments that have got hundreds in,

490
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,420
as opposed to small business and the restaurant game was the other point

491
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,320
that I was trying to make.

492
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,099
And, you know, perfect storm for George.

493
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,639
You're on TV, Australian tall poppy syndrome, as you said,

494
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,219
a touch of casual racism thrown in.

495
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,539
I find a parent, the council culture that has emerged, as you said before,

496
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,880
the LGI, the learn, grow and improve moments to say, yeah,

497
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,260
let's all put our hand up and we can all learn in this together.

498
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,760
I think it's a really worthwhile conversation to have.

499
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,460
I appreciate you sharing it because it leads to my next question.

500
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,019
I asked this young entrepreneur, I sat in a room once about to start

501
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,539
leadership business leader we're really passionate about.

502
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,599
And we had two people sitting there giving us some advice.

503
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:47,099
And one said,

504
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:52,320
for my, this is a tough path, you know, it's going to have all sorts of dramas.

505
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,079
And, you know, you've explained there's going to be some hard,

506
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,500
I wouldn't recommend.

507
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,940
And the other guy said, absolutely do it.

508
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,960
It's the greatest thing you can do to create something from nothing.

509
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,599
What advice would you give to an entrepreneur that maybe wants to go down your path?

510
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,340
I think that if you're following your passion and you've done the apprenticeship,

511
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,500
done the schooling, the schooling of life or schooling of university to go with,

512
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,360
to help you be at your best to deliver the outcome, you know,

513
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:26,440
I do meet a lot of people who just haven't done the hard yards

514
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,380
and understand the fundamentals enough to take that next step.

515
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,900
But, yeah, if you've got that great basis of, you know,

516
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,659
working with a big corporate and got the fundamentals of business

517
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:42,619
and perhaps done some university training, yeah, you're ready to have a crack

518
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,159
and you'll be fit for the journey.

519
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,519
Otherwise, you may end up, you know,

520
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,360
end up pretty frustrated and a lot of people point to success stories

521
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,260
and whilst there's a lot of those, there's many thousands more of people

522
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,760
where it hasn't worked out.

523
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,739
And so the realities of that need to be talked about.

524
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,860
And if you're up for that, fantastic.

525
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,920
Have a go.

526
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,820
Yeah, and I think that's great context too, Radhik, isn't it?

527
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,400
So if you're betting the house and the whole family future on a startup

528
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,460
without, as you said, a foundation of expertise,

529
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,659
and skill, maybe that's a little touch forward.

530
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,179
If you're having a crack at something you're super passionate about,

531
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,800
you love more than anything in your life, but if it doesn't work out,

532
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,880
you can go back to, you know, Village Roadshow or go and work for Radhik

533
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,800
at Wanderlust, which is where I wanted to head next.

534
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,719
And your passion for socially responsible, you know,

535
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,800
environmentally conscious projects.

536
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,340
Can I ask you about, you know, yoga to music and festivals?

537
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,019
What's the passion at the moment?

538
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:52,139
So there's kind of two main buckets to our investment organization called Light Warrior,

539
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,840
which is what my wife called me when she fell in love with me.

540
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,320
So we stuck with that name.

541
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,179
So we have Light Warriors, the kind of commercial stuff,

542
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,920
and Light Focus as our charitable foundation work.

543
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,539
And I spend half my time doing community work.

544
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm chair of a group called Igniting Change,

545
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,699
which is just the most extraordinary organization that works

546
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,420
with social entrepreneurs making change.

547
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:15,940
In the community.

548
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,960
And then I'm part of this group called the B Team

549
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,980
and the Climate Leaders Coalition, which I was a founding member of

550
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,079
and helped organize, and I was a founding member

551
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,019
of the B Team of Still Asia, which is plan A is under threat,

552
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,860
and we need to create a plan B, which is, and plan A is profits.

553
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,840
You know, businesses are built just to create profit for shareholders.

554
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:45,000
Plan B is about creating full stakeholder value.

555
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:50,280
And, and so, so yeah, so, and then this Climate Leaders Coalition,

556
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,719
which came out of the B Team has all 40 companies now,

557
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,599
over 35% of total carbon emissions represented.

558
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,639
We just want to get on with fixing the carbon issue and, and hit, hit targets

559
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:08,980
for 50% reduction by 2030 and, and, and the carbon issue by 2050.

560
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,440
But all work together to deliver that, which is just so enlightening and, and enlightening

561
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,820
in part.

562
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,960
And, and so precious to be a part of, and, and see that corporate Australia

563
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,739
is really prepared to make this next step.

564
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,699
We want to get on with it.

565
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,320
And so then whatever we do in business, we want to make sure we create great culture,

566
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,539
but they also are about enhancing our community.

567
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,980
So we, health is, is really, really key.

568
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,519
You know, if we don't love ourself, we're not going to love the world around us.

569
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,900
And so Wanderlust is about that, creating connection through yoga,

570
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:41,519
creating these amazing events that people want to go to, giving them

571
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,780
Ayurvedic products that, that are herbal products that have been used for thousands

572
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:44,940
of years.

573
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

574
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:49,619
And now being validated through science, um, posturing that next to meditation,

575
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,239
which you get introduced to through yoga and everyone loves doing a Shavasana after yoga.

576
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,159
Did you know yoga is the number one, um, number one sport in the country has the highest

577
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,360
participation in the country.

578
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:05,980
Um, so, so it's, it's got a massive, uh, massive appeal and could be even bigger.

579
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,199
Um, and, and so, um, so yeah, so, and then we've got this beautiful business called

580
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,900
commune, which is kind of the Netflix of, of wellness, which plugs in.

581
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,860
It's called social, social, social marketing in Australia, which is really

582
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,179
inspiring because you can find a lot of people who're willing to invest in

583
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:25,840
what we're talking about and, and, and, and, you know,

584
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,460
to, and to some degree, you know,

585
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,099
to make a difference at the, at the, at the, uh,

586
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,800
at the, uh, at the, at the company level.

587
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:37,679
So, uh, the, and the information has a lot to do with, with the fact that,

588
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,159
with the fact that we're, we're a nonprofit company, uh,

589
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,000
we're a, we've worked with the United States.

590
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,059
We're the biggest provider of social housing, also solar.

591
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,199
We're a significant provider of that.

592
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,219
We do social bonds, helping people stay in employment

593
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:56,980
that have been long-term out of work, in work.

594
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:00,159
So we're kind of, what we're trying to do is fuse purpose

595
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,920
in kind of all of these community needs.

596
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:07,280
And why we're driven by that is I love what we've got here in Australia,

597
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,000
this balance of capitalism and democracy.

598
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,519
You know, the alternative is a dictatorial capitalist.

599
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,980
That's the next most successful option.

600
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,099
And so we'll end up down that path if we don't nurture what we've got

601
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:19,880
and make it better.

602
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Yes, there are challenges with it, but we can't blow it up.

603
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,659
We've got to work with it and enhance it.

604
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,639
And how we do that is by leading by example.

605
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,260
I can see why you need your 20 minutes twice a day, Radek.

606
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,820
There's a lot happening for good.

607
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,280
And that's why I love sitting down and having the chance to listen

608
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,980
and learn from you.

609
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,800
And I love hearing from people like you who've got a genuine purpose

610
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,340
and the passion comes out any time you bump into Radek Seller.

611
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,719
You know there's going to be some joy involved.

612
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,559
And as you've heard today, it doesn't mean that there's not some

613
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:54,840
ripping bumps along the way, is there, that you have to front up

614
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,960
and get the growth out of at the time.

615
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,139
It's brilliant to hear the projects that are underway

616
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:05,039
and so much going back into the greater good and the community.

617
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,260
We're a bit obsessed in leadership in these conversations

618
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,760
and these sort of different cues.

619
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,820
That are left behind from leaders, common leadership traits.

620
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
I want to ask you a few questions along that basis.

621
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,039
And we think very hard to lead, Radek, without a sense of self-leadership first.

622
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,079
What does self-leadership mean to you?

623
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:27,099
I think it's being in a state that you can be at your best.

624
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:32,280
So it goes back to the principles we discussed about meditation

625
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,820
and wellness programs.

626
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,980
You've really got to think about how you kind of integrate that

627
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,400
into your lifestyle to be at your best for work

628
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,039
and be at your best for your family.

629
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,880
And your friends.

630
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,280
So then you can truly lead with freedom.

631
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:47,139
Yeah, well said.

632
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,460
Absolutely, that shows up in the language of your daily routine

633
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,940
and taking care of yourself first.

634
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,440
You've been awarded for the impact you have in your environment.

635
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,659
We see leaders are getting more conscious, Radek,

636
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,380
about how they impact people positively every day.

637
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,699
And I heard you say that.

638
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,440
I'm obsessed with making sure people who work with me are happy.

639
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,840
How do you go about that?

640
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,699
What sort of detail do you do on a daily basis

641
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,059
to make that happen?

642
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:18,619
Well, I think that this kind of emphasis on thinking about your culture

643
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,280
and living and breathing your culture

644
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,239
and creating a language framework that's relevant to your organisation.

645
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,320
So every business that we work with, we ask for the business plan,

646
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,659
but then we ask for the culture plan and the values plan.

647
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,400
And values is something we're all familiar with.

648
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,280
And I've been in a lot of businesses in the past where I haven't led,

649
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:42,039
where the values were up on the wall.

650
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,380
But they weren't really lived.

651
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,119
But the values should be a guiding compass in how you make decisions.

652
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:52,500
And you should be able to remember your values and reel them off.

653
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,559
So whenever someone presents the values, I say,

654
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,119
okay, well, cover your eyes now and tell me your values.

655
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,019
And a lot of the time they forget because they're just doing it

656
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,039
because they're ticking the box.

657
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:04,320
And they're not really thinking about how those values need to live

658
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,119
and breathe and grow with the organisation.

659
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,639
And everyone needs to own them and be a part of them.

660
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,659
And so that becomes your best culture leader,

661
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,039
your best mechanism for reminding people of how you make decisions,

662
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,719
your best mechanism of when you're not in the room,

663
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,139
knowing that a moral compass is going to come out

664
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:26,900
and reinforce the way you would make decisions with a group of people

665
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,719
and you not having to worry about being all over every decision made in a business.

666
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:36,239
So the business then is free to grow without you having to be across everything.

667
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:41,239
So this kind of value of culture is probably being recognised more

668
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:47,900
than when we started practising it back in 2005, 2006, when I started at SWIS.

669
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:53,880
But even later on in the journey, I'd still have people saying,

670
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,400
surely giving people a free lunch for performing doesn't really help.

671
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,420
And I'd have to sort of smile and say, well, that's not the case.

672
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,420
You are human and I'm sure you like getting a free lunch

673
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,099
when it works out pretty well for you too.

674
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:10,280
And this is that kind of separation.

675
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,039
That of cultures that's kind of starting to dissipate.

676
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:20,340
But I feel like we're seeing the last pop of it with all of these old blokes

677
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,400
that are holding on to positions in politics,

678
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,579
which is the most public way of kind of seeing this going on.

679
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,539
And you're seeing it with these kind of leaders in China, Russia,

680
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,219
even the US and those personalities that just aren't making way

681
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:38,400
for this next guard of leadership,

682
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,260
that they are more aware.

683
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,719
And get that, you know, it's not just men on this planet.

684
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,659
There are women and 50% of us came from women

685
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:51,099
and the other half are women.

686
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,280
So us blokes are pretty damn insecure.

687
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,179
And so we've created this system that kind of protects us

688
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:03,500
and makes us less feminine and champions male qualities.

689
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,739
But we're seeing change in our time.

690
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,639
We're seeing this great balance of feminine qualities

691
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,260
and males that, you know, we're seeing change in our time.

692
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,699
You know, display these feminine qualities, you know,

693
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,739
it's really inquisitive and it's fantastic and it's a great change.

694
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,159
And I think we'll see much better leaders as that dynamic continues

695
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:25,059
to perpetuate and that focus on culture and that feeling of how we feel

696
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,300
from, you know, being able to talk about meditation,

697
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:30,719
talk about being well and how much of a difference that makes

698
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,579
to everyone around us as well as ourselves.

699
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,500
How much better are we going to be if we can all start thinking

700
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,800
a bit more like that, like what's happening in this day and age?

701
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,179
Yeah.

702
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,760
Well said, Radhik, and from the world that I spent a lot of my time

703
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,199
in the sporting world has changed enormously from that old school hierarchy

704
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:52,320
and verbal, you know, abuse, bit of everything thrown into so much more

705
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,119
empathy and care and with much more sustainable results and success.

706
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,940
It's a big shift and that is, you know, the title of this podcast,

707
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,300
Empowering Leadership, how to empower others to be great.

708
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,480
You know, it's a huge part of your success story from day one

709
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,500
and you can hear it.

710
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,519
And those footy players are just as elite, even more elite than what they were.

711
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,500
I mean, you'd see that today and just go, wow, the stuff they do,

712
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,500
you'd know from their son and the system and what they're producing

713
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,860
in this day and age is better.

714
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,719
So, you know, it's improving.

715
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:27,019
And they're tougher and they're braver and they, you know,

716
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,420
you don't have to have all the macho pretense that used to be around.

717
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,480
It's, you know, a healthier scenario unfolding.

718
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,039
And when people like you share those conversations, it's really powerful.

719
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,219
The idea of creating and sharing a vision.

720
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,360
We just heard about six or seven projects that have got big vision.

721
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,880
You know, you're talking about government, sorry,

722
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:50,719
company solving the carbon challenge, which is massive around the world,

723
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,900
around sustainable investing.

724
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,639
There's so many big, how do you go about, you know,

725
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:58,840
when you're in a position to influence creating and sharing a vision?

726
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:08,159
Yeah, I think that you've got to start with where you've got your superpowers.

727
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,739
Yes, I, this is not visual,

728
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,460
but I've got this superpower that I've practiced for quite a while where I can

729
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,219
move my hair up and down in my ears.

730
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,219
And that came from a lot of practice as a kid because my granddad could do it.

731
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,219
It's a good party trick, Raddick.

732
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,179
Particularly, can I say, and we are recording this, with a man bun,

733
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,860
that is a, you know, the eye, the head, that is a good party trick.

734
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,119
It's big.

735
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,360
And so, but if we, for the point is that,

736
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,380
we've all got a superpower that we've been working on along this kind of

737
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:46,159
lifetime journey and something that we're a little bit better than others at

738
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:46,500
doing.

739
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,340
And we might not be the best in the world,

740
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,539
but we're a little bit better than the average person.

741
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,659
And so we've got to really start there on focusing on what we're kind of a

742
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:56,960
little bit better at than others.

743
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:01,360
And then that helps kind of trigger your vision around that,

744
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,900
that passion and where you want to, where you want to step into it.

745
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,639
And it could be as big as building a business.

746
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:12,800
It's going to solve issues, or it could be as simple as I just want to do.

747
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,139
I want to train,

748
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,579
be a personal trainer and train people to be healthier versions of themselves.

749
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,380
And that's what I get up and be passionate about.

750
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,219
And I love that because I'm better than the average person in exciting someone to

751
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:25,639
do that.

752
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,539
And so we've all just got to listen to our inner voice and find our purpose.

753
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:35,300
And we live in this great society where we can, we can pick and choose.

754
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,219
And that's why I kind of say,

755
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:39,679
we've got to protect it and build on it and,

756
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,699
and have more people following out what they love doing.

757
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,699
So we create more purpose and our system keeps on improving like I believe it is.

758
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,599
So leaders that have great success like you,

759
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:54,320
Radhik, curiosity is a common word that we hear.

760
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,219
And through curiosity,

761
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,420
that's how people like you tend to approach their learning and development and

762
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,059
self-improvement.

763
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:02,460
Does that resonate to you, the thought of being curious?

764
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:05,159
Yeah, I'd hate to,

765
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:07,199
I always get my back up when my wife,

766
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:09,079
my wife says I'm not listening to her.

767
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,340
Although I think that this is kind of something we need to all think about is

768
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,780
because, you know,

769
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,239
we've all got a partner or someone that loves us dearly in our lives who says

770
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:18,539
that we don't listen to them.

771
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,440
And, and what I've worked out,

772
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,940
it's probably about three times it takes before I sometimes I'll register

773
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,219
because you take them for granted.

774
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,219
And so in the workplace,

775
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,840
what I remind leaders of is that,

776
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,059
Hey, you're not,

777
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:30,880
everyone listens to you.

778
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
They don't love you as much as that loved person in your life.

779
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,260
So you're probably going to have to repeat five to 10 times,

780
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,019
um,

781
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:37,400
what,

782
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,659
what the mission is and how you're going to go about it.

783
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:40,760
And you've got to simplify it.

784
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,760
So it's easily digestible and people can get on with it.

785
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:44,400
Um,

786
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,699
and,

787
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,539
and so part of that is kind of the curiosity factor and,

788
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,039
and,

789
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:49,280
and,

790
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,719
and not killing that by nagging people to,

791
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,960
to actually get outcomes.

792
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,340
So allowing people to sit down and talk about all of their issues and,

793
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:57,780
and saying,

794
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:57,960
well,

795
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,179
this,

796
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,320
this is a strategic session where there's permission to talk about

797
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,780
everything and where you sit down and you really hear things and you listen

798
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,179
to stuff that's not working as well as it,

799
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:08,480
could and could be improved.

800
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,719
You just gain so much insight from that.

801
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:10,940
And,

802
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:11,320
you know,

803
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,679
my biggest insights have always come from,

804
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:17,920
I've listened to customers without an agenda or just caught up and free

805
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,800
wheeled with someone,

806
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,420
um,

807
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,599
to just talk about what,

808
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:20,960
what,

809
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,239
what's going on in life.

810
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,780
And then all of a sudden you're putting two to two together.

811
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,739
And there's a whole method around that kind of thinking,

812
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,119
which is called design thinking.

813
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,840
Um,

814
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,059
it's beyond research,

815
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,320
which is research driven,

816
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,059
uh,

817
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:36,199
outcomes where you're asking people questions and they're pointed and you,

818
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,199
you get people,

819
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,960
sense of what they like and they dislike.

820
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,880
Design thinking is about kind of organizing opportunity through a series of

821
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,920
conversations and incidences that happen.

822
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,800
And you can create structures in your workplace that kind of enable that kind

823
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,920
of thinking to grow and thrive.

824
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:53,239
And,

825
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,460
and,

826
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:53,619
you know,

827
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:57,619
this is a large reason that we've seen a lot of innovation that's kind of off

828
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:58,099
the charts.

829
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:58,280
You know,

830
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,900
who would have thought our phones would be a personal computer in this day and

831
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,219
age.

832
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:02,760
And that,

833
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,539
that would never,

834
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:05,320
as Steve jobs beautifully says,

835
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,659
it's never come from research.

836
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,199
It,

837
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,139
it's essentially come from innovation and design thinking.

838
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,480
And so if you can kind of master that craft and,

839
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,760
and,

840
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,460
and nurture that and nurture curiosity in your business through listening and

841
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,480
engaging with people,

842
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,139
um,

843
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,300
that that's where you'll,

844
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,119
you'll really harness your superpowers and,

845
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:22,739
and,

846
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,340
and grow something pretty extraordinary.

847
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,059
I think that aligned really,

848
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,480
uh,

849
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,500
with the next dimension I wanted to talk to you about.

850
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:29,119
Well,

851
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,340
it is really conscious of how they communicate to others and communicating

852
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,619
with,

853
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,420
with clarity.

854
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:35,139
How have you gone about that in your world?

855
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:37,579
Yeah.

856
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:39,000
So it's,

857
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,119
it's difficult because I,

858
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:40,840
I kind of,

859
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:41,940
I,

860
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:42,219
I'm,

861
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:42,679
I,

862
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,179
I understand that I can be my own worst enemy in,

863
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,719
in kind of making,

864
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,119
being too broad in,

865
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,079
in what we've got to deliver and how we're going to make it happen.

866
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,400
So I also make sure that I'm never the smartest person in the room,

867
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,960
but we've got a whole lot of people that are smarter than me or better than

868
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,719
me at particularly things that I'm not that good at.

869
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:06,059
So,

870
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:06,900
um,

871
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,300
or,

872
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:07,619
you know,

873
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:07,920
might,

874
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:08,360
you know,

875
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,039
might need support around.

876
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,699
And so having those individuals around you that,

877
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:13,019
that,

878
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:17,239
that remind you of that and improve you and help you become better in those

879
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,340
areas and never be as good as what they are,

880
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,599
but definitely helping you get an understanding and empathy,

881
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,320
uh,

882
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,719
for how you go about it just creates this kind of balance and blend that

883
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:28,559
delivers an outcome.

884
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,079
Just like,

885
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:29,320
you know,

886
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,880
if we talk about a sporting team,

887
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:32,440
you've got to get your team right.

888
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,880
And every person has a fit for purpose of what they bring in.

889
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:36,280
You know,

890
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,400
not everyone can be the full forward and kick a lot of goals like they did

891
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,159
back in the nineties.

892
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:40,900
Um,

893
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,280
you know,

894
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,900
you've got to create a whole team that everyone is involved in.

895
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:45,699
And that's why,

896
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:45,980
you know,

897
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,340
again,

898
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,860
that's a great example of how,

899
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,260
how sports improved.

900
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,000
It's gone beyond one person,

901
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:51,760
it's team and,

902
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:51,980
you know,

903
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:55,579
people on the bench matter as much as the people on the field.

904
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,079
Um,

905
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,480
and every single person on the field and they've all got a role.

906
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:00,699
That's exactly the same thing in a business.

907
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:00,960
And,

908
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,300
and they're not thinking about that and not having,

909
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:03,820
you know,

910
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,840
and I love using sporting analogies in,

911
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,159
in kind of the,

912
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:08,420
the whole feedback thing.

913
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,360
If you see a team where,

914
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:10,679
you know,

915
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:13,260
someone isn't performing and if you see the coach say,

916
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,260
how are you going to do this better?

917
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,860
And the person gives it back to them and says,

918
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,039
I don't want to hear that from you.

919
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,320
You just go,

920
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:18,820
wow,

921
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
that team's dysfunctional.

922
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,960
They're not going to win this game.

923
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:22,980
That happens in the workplace every day.

924
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:23,500
You know,

925
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:23,820
you get,

926
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
you get a manager saying,

927
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,800
how are you not doing that?

928
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,480
That well,

929
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,699
the person under their breath walks away and go,

930
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:29,219
that guy's a,

931
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:32,440
I can't stand waiting with them and starts poisoning the rest of the team.

932
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:33,119
And,

933
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:35,820
and then all of a sudden you get this negative culture because there is,

934
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,739
and this openness and ability to kind of share and improve and,

935
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:40,940
and permission to get better.

936
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:41,440
You know,

937
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:45,699
I liken it to going back to the personal trainer analogy or going to the gym

938
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,400
for the first time and you get a trainer in and,

939
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,179
and you kind of,

940
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,960
if you did your first 10 pushups and that trainer said to you,

941
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:53,360
you know,

942
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,780
three in that you look really tired,

943
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,980
you're not going to get through this.

944
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,920
That's many workplaces.

945
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,019
And so this is language,

946
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,340
openness,

947
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:01,880
and,

948
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,099
and,

949
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,579
and everyone having a clear role and a purpose in an organization is,

950
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:05,760
is,

951
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,960
is something that should be the basics of business.

952
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,719
And we see a feedback loop in sports so quick,

953
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,099
isn't it?

954
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,800
You get outcomes very quickly.

955
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,820
And so you can say,

956
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,559
I had Matt Lafleur on this podcast recently,

957
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:18,960
Raddick is the head coach of the green Bay pack is brilliant,

958
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,679
outstanding young leader,

959
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,760
but all he was obsessed about talking was his 23 strong coaching staff and

960
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,099
how they are smarter than him.

961
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:29,980
And the jigsaw puzzle of putting together and how much care and thought he's

962
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,860
got for all the skills I can bring that this is an incredibly capable,

963
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:34,940
successful individual,

964
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:35,780
but so,

965
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,480
but so sophisticated and strategic around,

966
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,960
you know,

967
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,940
putting the pieces of,

968
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:40,900
of the puzzle together,

969
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,219
which was aligned a lot with what you said.

970
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:46,219
And then we see the leaders more than ever conscious of collaboration,

971
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:47,940
Raddick and,

972
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,960
and see collaboration is just a real superpower to use one of your terms.

973
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,800
How important has that been for you collaborating?

974
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:56,039
Well,

975
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,320
you know,

976
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,539
you can only do so much.

977
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,440
And so accepting that what you're,

978
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,599
what you're able to do and then who you need to partner with to enable you,

979
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:12,900
to go that next step is the key to unlocking extraordinary opportunity.

980
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:19,679
So for me collaboration partnerships just have to be nurtures.

981
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,199
And so I'm a pretty strange one in this regard.

982
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,639
My closest friends all work in businesses that we operate in and all work with me.

983
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:33,800
My wife was our director of marketing at Swiss for eight years.

984
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,119
And so,

985
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,119
you know,

986
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,119
I run the gauntlet and we brought her on because she was whinging about her boss

987
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,119
and I couldn't get any decent talent.

988
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:42,619
And I said,

989
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:43,119
well,

990
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,119
you're not going to be able to whinge about me,

991
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:46,119
but we've got a role I need you to fill.

992
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:48,119
So it'd be fantastic if you came and worked with us.

993
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,119
And,

994
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,119
and it was fantastic.

995
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:51,119
And,

996
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,119
and,

997
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:53,119
you know,

998
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,119
it was probably eight years was about right for our marriage.

999
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,119
But,

1000
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,119
but,

1001
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,119
you know,

1002
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,119
my best friends at CEOs or,

1003
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,119
or chief revenue officers,

1004
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:05,119
you know,

1005
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,119
you name it,

1006
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,119
are in our businesses and,

1007
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,119
and,

1008
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,119
and they're great friends because we spend the majority of time with each other.

1009
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,119
But we,

1010
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:13,119
we call each other out.

1011
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,119
And I learnt this at,

1012
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,119
at,

1013
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,119
at Village Roadshow.

1014
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,119
When you're working the candy bar as an 18 year old who suddenly realises I'm paying for a university course

1015
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:23,119
and I'm getting paid to learn about business in,

1016
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,119
in,

1017
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:25,119
in,

1018
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,119
at the cinemas.

1019
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,119
I was like,

1020
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,119
wow,

1021
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,119
what am I doing?

1022
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,119
I'm not going to mess around here.

1023
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,119
I'm going to get stuck into this and work my guts out because I'm being paid to be it.

1024
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,119
Give me every responsibility possible and I'll do it for nothing.

1025
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,119
And over and above whatever.

1026
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,119
I better be careful because I was paid by an hour.

1027
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,119
I don't want to get billed into wage issues.

1028
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,119
It was just my passion.

1029
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,119
I loved it.

1030
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,119
You know,

1031
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:47,119
it was my take home homework to make it better.

1032
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,119
And so I'll,

1033
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,119
I'll just be calling out for,

1034
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,119
you know,

1035
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:52,119
give me the most boring job like a stock take and I'll,

1036
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:53,119
I'll do it.

1037
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,119
And then also,

1038
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:55,119
you know,

1039
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,119
we've got to inspire my mates to kind of upsell in the candy bar.

1040
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,119
So,

1041
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,119
you know,

1042
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,119
if you,

1043
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:01,119
you bought a Coke,

1044
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,119
do you want to,

1045
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:03,119
you want a large popcorn with that,

1046
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,119
that,

1047
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:05,119
your friends would be like,

1048
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,119
I don't want to say that.

1049
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,119
I'll do that.

1050
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,119
And you had to learn how to get,

1051
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,119
you know,

1052
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,119
these are your friends that you'd go for a beer with afterwards and chat about how work went.

1053
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:13,119
And,

1054
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,119
and you'd become a shift supervisor and you had to do it in a way that was kind of collegiate and,

1055
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,119
and,

1056
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,119
and getting them on board and sharing purpose and making it a bit of a bit of fun out of it.

1057
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,119
And,

1058
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,119
you know,

1059
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,119
seeing if we could be,

1060
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,119
you know,

1061
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,119
the best team and,

1062
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:29,119
and,

1063
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,119
and be great at what we did and,

1064
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,119
and,

1065
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,119
and,

1066
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:33,119
and getting people to see that that's going to be a whole lot better way to spend the three hours we worked together while we had a lot of fun doing it.

1067
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,119
And,

1068
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,119
but it's just became part of the nature of friendship and,

1069
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,119
and kind of bonding and,

1070
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,119
and not being a dickhead really.

1071
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,119
And,

1072
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,119
and,

1073
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,119
and,

1074
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,119
and,

1075
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:45,119
and bringing your best self and your,

1076
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,119
and your authentic self,

1077
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,119
that same person you are in your social life,

1078
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:49,119
you're in,

1079
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,119
in your work life.

1080
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:53,119
So then it's sustainable and it's not exhausting to,

1081
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,119
to be someone else at work than,

1082
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,119
than who you are at home.

1083
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,119
You can just be consistent and,

1084
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,119
and that's easier.

1085
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,119
Great Australian success story,

1086
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:03,119
Village Roadshow.

1087
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,119
And I inadvertently read it,

1088
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:05,119
it was the same,

1089
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,119
the same,

1090
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,119
when they owned Oz Stereo and I worked at Triple M doing the,

1091
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,119
the Breakfast Radio with that team.

1092
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,119
And you just,

1093
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,119
you got this sense that,

1094
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,119
that's,

1095
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,119
you know,

1096
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,119
when you make movies for a living and you know,

1097
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,119
there's a portion,

1098
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,119
a portion of them aren't going to work,

1099
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,119
there's a risk taking funnel.

1100
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,119
You know,

1101
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,119
it just,

1102
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,119
it was a place that loved good ideas at that stage.

1103
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,119
And if you had a good idea,

1104
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,119
it was a chance to get up and it could come from anywhere.

1105
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,119
And,

1106
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,119
you know,

1107
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,119
I'm not surprised you took a lot out of your time working under the team from Village Roadshow.

1108
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,119
Final two questions,

1109
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:38,119
I've been asking a range of different leaders and I've loved every bit.

1110
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:39,119
There's so much synergy,

1111
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,119
you know,

1112
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,119
in the world you talk about.

1113
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,119
My wife,

1114
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,119
Bex,

1115
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,119
a meditation teacher and a yoga teacher.

1116
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,119
And I have the same practice,

1117
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,119
you know,

1118
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,119
twice a day.

1119
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,119
I don't look as healthy as you,

1120
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,119
mate.

1121
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,119
So I need to,

1122
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,119
I need to talk to you after this,

1123
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:54,119
this finishes to get some balance.

1124
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:58,119
I might need to be in your back shed up there in Brunswick head at some stage.

1125
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:02,119
But I want to ask you who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1126
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:05,690
Look,

1127
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,690
to me,

1128
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:07,690
it's,

1129
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,690
it's the most inspiring person I work with.

1130
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:14,690
I've got a dog that's going to keep barking if I don't pull her off the couch here.

1131
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,690
She's a bit older.

1132
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,690
So it's time to pull her off.

1133
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:19,690
I like it.

1134
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,449
There's Floella.

1135
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:25,449
Floella.

1136
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:26,449
How old is Floella?

1137
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:28,449
She's 14.

1138
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:31,449
So the greatest leader,

1139
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:32,449
I mean,

1140
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:35,449
the most inspiring leader that I work with is a lady called Joan.

1141
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:36,449
Jane Tooson.

1142
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:37,449
And she's just extraordinary.

1143
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:38,449
She,

1144
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:41,449
she is CEO of Igniting Change.

1145
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:44,449
She's just a gift that we have here in Australia.

1146
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:48,449
She set up Virgin Unite with Richard Branson.

1147
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,449
He,

1148
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,449
you know,

1149
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:52,449
this was back in the eighties.

1150
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,449
And,

1151
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:57,449
and she kind of enabled these kind of philanthropic endeavours back in the day,

1152
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,449
inspired them.

1153
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:03,449
And he funded an office for her kind of early days,

1154
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:04,449
which,

1155
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:07,449
that sort of span out into Red Nose Day there,

1156
01:01:07,449 --> 01:01:10,449
which is different to the SIDS Red Nose Day that we know here.

1157
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:12,449
It's comic relief there.

1158
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:13,449
And,

1159
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:16,449
and that still raises two to 300 billion pounds per year,

1160
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:17,449
that initiative,

1161
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:18,449
which is just extraordinary.

1162
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:21,449
And she did also a lot of work with the Royal Family,

1163
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:22,449
Lady Di,

1164
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,449
and,

1165
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,449
and,

1166
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:25,449
and,

1167
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:26,449
and connecting her with community and,

1168
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,449
and,

1169
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:28,449
and,

1170
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:29,449
and making things,

1171
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:30,449
you know,

1172
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:31,449
bringing things to life and,

1173
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:32,449
and,

1174
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:33,449
and the frontline.

1175
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:35,449
She moved to Australia 20 odd years ago.

1176
01:01:35,449 --> 01:01:36,449
And,

1177
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:38,449
and she just does this inspiring work with,

1178
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:39,449
you know,

1179
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:43,449
hundreds of different individuals in community and just getting beyond,

1180
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,449
you know,

1181
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:46,449
the unfashionable issues that we,

1182
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:47,449
we deal with.

1183
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:50,449
I'm privileged to be chair of the organisation.

1184
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:51,449
And,

1185
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:52,449
and,

1186
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:55,449
and the unfashionable issues like drug addiction and,

1187
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,449
and,

1188
01:01:56,449 --> 01:01:57,449
and,

1189
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,449
and First Nations people,

1190
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,449
homelessness,

1191
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:02,449
and,

1192
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:03,449
and refugees,

1193
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:04,449
and,

1194
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:07,449
and kind of getting into the nitty gritty of people that don't have the

1195
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:10,449
time to fill out forms and aren't part of big organisations.

1196
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:12,449
They're just doing stuff in community and,

1197
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:13,449
and need,

1198
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:14,449
you know,

1199
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:17,449
some support to enable them to do that.

1200
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:21,449
We never help them because they help us just as much back with sharing

1201
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:24,449
their journey of what they do and,

1202
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,449
and,

1203
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:26,449
and how they go about it.

1204
01:02:26,449 --> 01:02:27,449
And,

1205
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,449
and the way Jane garners people's passion and,

1206
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:31,449
and connects people with like-minded organisations,

1207
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:34,449
and creates purpose for family offices,

1208
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:35,449
businesses,

1209
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:36,449
and so forth is,

1210
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:37,449
is,

1211
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,449
is just,

1212
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:39,449
it's so inspiring.

1213
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:40,449
And it's,

1214
01:02:40,449 --> 01:02:43,449
it's kind of turned into the practice of how we go about doing things at

1215
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:45,449
Light Warrior and trying to weave that net,

1216
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:46,449
that net between community and,

1217
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:47,449
and,

1218
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:48,449
and corporates.

1219
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:49,449
Yeah,

1220
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:50,449
she's a remarkable lady,

1221
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:51,449
Jane,

1222
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:52,449
the privilege of meeting her.

1223
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:53,449
And I walked into the,

1224
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:54,449
the space in St Kilda,

1225
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:55,449
I think,

1226
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:56,449
and it's an eclectic world.

1227
01:02:56,449 --> 01:02:57,449
There's always,

1228
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:58,449
you know,

1229
01:02:58,449 --> 01:02:59,449
someone's,

1230
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,449
you know,

1231
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:01,449
someone's,

1232
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:02,449
you know,

1233
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:06,449
refugee who's making a brilliant bit of tapestry or,

1234
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,449
you know,

1235
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:10,449
she's doing work in youth prisons to support,

1236
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:11,449
you know,

1237
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:14,449
young people who shouldn't be incarcerated.

1238
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:16,449
And the areas that people find very difficult,

1239
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,449
my interactions with her,

1240
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:21,449
she seems to navigate better than anyone I've ever met.

1241
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:25,449
And I didn't realise that you were so integrated into that space,

1242
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:26,449
igniting change.

1243
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,449
Look it up if you haven't seen the work that Ruddock and,

1244
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:29,449
and Jane do there.

1245
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:30,449
It's remarkable.

1246
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:31,449
It's a remarkable organisation.

1247
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,449
One of the many great things Ruddock's doing in the spirit of collaboration.

1248
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,449
Final question for you,

1249
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,449
Ruddock.

1250
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:38,449
Sorry.

1251
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:42,449
Thank you for your part in what you do with igniting change and,

1252
01:03:42,449 --> 01:03:43,449
and visiting jails and,

1253
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:44,449
and,

1254
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:47,449
and introducing meditation to people that otherwise wouldn't have access to it.

1255
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,449
It's just,

1256
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,449
you know,

1257
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:52,449
that's first class stuff that you don't really talk about and too humble about.

1258
01:03:52,449 --> 01:03:53,449
Thank you,

1259
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:54,449
Ruddock.

1260
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:55,449
No,

1261
01:03:55,449 --> 01:03:56,449
it's a,

1262
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:57,449
it's a privilege to have that opportunity to,

1263
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:58,449
to,

1264
01:03:58,449 --> 01:03:59,449
to sit down and try and do some good.

1265
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,449
It's inspiring,

1266
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:01,449
um,

1267
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:02,449
to hear what,

1268
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:03,449
uh,

1269
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:04,449
what you're up to for sure.

1270
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:05,449
If you could collaborate with anyone,

1271
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:06,449
there's such a broad range of interests you've got,

1272
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:07,449
and you're looking at solving,

1273
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:08,449
uh,

1274
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,449
you know,

1275
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:10,449
huge,

1276
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:11,449
um,

1277
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:12,449
things that make a difference in the world.

1278
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,449
Is there one person you've thought of?

1279
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,449
I could collaborate.

1280
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:15,449
I mean,

1281
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,449
Jane springs to mind clearly from a leadership point of view,

1282
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:18,449
someone else you thought that,

1283
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:21,449
that will be the difference if I could get that person on board.

1284
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:22,449
Oh,

1285
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:23,449
look,

1286
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:24,449
I think there's four jets,

1287
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:25,449
um,

1288
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:27,449
that kind of I've thought about.

1289
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:28,449
There's this,

1290
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:29,449
we,

1291
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,449
we've got grass and Michelle coming out to Australia.

1292
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:33,449
Who's Nelson Mandela's wife,

1293
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:34,449
uh,

1294
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:37,449
when he passed away and she was first lady of Mozambique as well.

1295
01:04:37,449 --> 01:04:39,449
So she's just an extraordinary individual.

1296
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:40,449
Um,

1297
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:41,449
but she's still with us.

1298
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:42,449
Um,

1299
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:43,449
so I'd love to work with Nelson,

1300
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,449
um,

1301
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,449
and,

1302
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,449
and,

1303
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,449
and get Richard in the room as well,

1304
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:48,449
Richard Branson.

1305
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:49,449
Um,

1306
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:51,449
and I've had the great privilege to work with as well and,

1307
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:53,449
and just see the sparks fly and see what,

1308
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:54,449
what,

1309
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:55,449
what,

1310
01:04:55,449 --> 01:04:56,449
what could happen.

1311
01:04:56,449 --> 01:04:57,449
Um,

1312
01:04:57,449 --> 01:04:58,449
that would be a,

1313
01:04:58,449 --> 01:04:59,449
I'd like to sit on,

1314
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:00,449
uh,

1315
01:05:00,449 --> 01:05:01,449
right with,

1316
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:02,449
uh,

1317
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:03,449
uh,

1318
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:04,449
Richard Branson,

1319
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:05,449
Nelson Mandela,

1320
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:06,449
and,

1321
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:07,449
uh,

1322
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:08,449
your good self and,

1323
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:09,449
uh,

1324
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:10,449
a conversation that would,

1325
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:11,449
