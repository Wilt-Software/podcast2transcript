1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,589
How do you remain composed and balanced under the most extreme pressure?

2
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,190
Why is having an inner circle of people you can trust

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,629
with shared values so important in challenging times?

4
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,070
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,530
The idea of self-improvement and leadership,

6
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,690
both on and off the field, has been a lifelong passion of mine.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,590
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,350
and I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,509
in education, sport, industry and the arts

10
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:42,469
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

11
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,950
where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,530
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,230
Raylene Castle was born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,829
before moving to New Zealand at the age of six months.

15
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,310
Her mother, Marlene, was a four-time Commonwealth game representative and medalist

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,209
while her father, Bruce, is a former Kiwis rugby league captain.

17
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,590
Raylene's own sporting career included representative level netball

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,650
and a professional football player.

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,250
and tennis and following in her mother's footsteps

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,090
as a New Zealand Lawn Bowls champion.

21
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,890
Her corporate career included senior leadership roles

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,549
with some of New Zealand's leading companies,

23
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,750
Telecom, Bank of New Zealand and Fuji Xerox.

24
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,750
Raylene applies for and gets big roles in the sports executive world,

25
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,909
starting as the CEO of New Zealand Netball in 2013,

26
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:42,269
being appointed as the first female CEO in the National Rugby League in Australia

27
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,650
with the Canterbury Bulldogs,

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,650
then moving on to be the first female CEO of Rugby Australia in 2013.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,730
In her current role, she has become the first woman appointed

30
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,890
to New Zealand's top role in sports administration

31
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,370
as the head of Sport New Zealand.

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,650
Raylene, thank you very much for joining me.

33
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,790
It's an incredible life of leadership.

34
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,670
Did you set out to be a trailblazer or has that just occurred along the way?

35
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,349
Yeah, no, it's just occurred along the way, Luke.

36
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,729
It's, yeah, sometimes when you sit and actually hear, you know,

37
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:13,870
you read out that CV, it surprises even me, I think, you know,

38
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:14,990
when I actually look back at it.

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,969
So it wasn't where I started.

40
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,229
Going out, I just, I think, always just wanted to maximise

41
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,110
the opportunity that was in front of me.

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,669
And that's led me to where I am today.

43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,110
In 2011, you received the prestigious Sir Peter Blake Leadership Award

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,229
named after the legendary New Zealand yachtsman.

45
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,289
And to read from the citation,

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,789
you're recognised for your inclusive style of leadership,

47
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,050
your ability to build good strategic partnerships

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,490
that have benefited every organisation that you've touched.

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,110
Now, how would you, Raylene, describe yourself as a leader?

50
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,669
Yeah, well, I think that inclusive is really part of that.

51
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,849
And I think authenticity is the other part,

52
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,750
underpinned by a really good dose of resilience.

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,150
And I think if you bring those three things together,

54
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,870
that's, for me, has been really important.

55
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:07,770
I think being able to relate to people at every level.

56
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,569
You know, I have a favourite quote, which is an Albert Einstein quote,

57
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,009
which is, I speak to the garbage man or the president of the university

58
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:15,909
in the same way.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,650
And that sort of ability,

60
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,330
to be able to relate to people,

61
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,969
engage with, you know, everyone from, you know, the receptionists,

62
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,270
the people working, you know, and supporting the organisation.

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,469
In my early days, it was the truck drivers at Fuji Xerox

64
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,889
who were, you know, driving fork hoists

65
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,870
and being able to sit down on a crate

66
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,030
and have a beer with them on a Friday night

67
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,569
is just as important as being able to be with you today on this podcast

68
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,689
and make sense to those audiences.

69
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,930
So, you know, that and that authenticity underpin

70
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,490
with a good...

71
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,949
A dose of resilience is really the combination, I think.

72
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,969
And I think your resilience comes out in everything that you've touched.

73
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,430
And I'm looking forward to going through so many of those incredible stories.

74
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,210
I love that quote from Albert Einstein.

75
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,490
I haven't heard it in that context,

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,310
but a lot of the ladies who have been speaking to you here,

77
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,030
almost to paraphrase that,

78
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,610
they talk about judging people by how they treat those

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,849
that aren't in a position of power versus those that are.

80
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,050
And it is fascinating that I did a radio show,

81
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,889
I learned for 11 years,

82
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,029
and I would subconsciously...

83
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,529
I would subconsciously do the same thing,

84
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,189
would have guests come in high profile.

85
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,769
And to me, the insight was, you know,

86
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,529
whether or not they understood, you know,

87
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,449
who was the producer or who handed them a coffee

88
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,329
and remembered names.

89
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,810
So you do tend to gauge a lot, don't you,

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,889
from leaders around the way they treat people

91
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,629
at all different levels.

92
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,589
I want to jump, Raylene, to a part of your life where,

93
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,250
and as I said, you have been a trailblazer.

94
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,230
You're appointed as the first female CEO in the NRL,

95
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,209
the Canterbury Bulldogs.

96
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,810
And they had some challenges, big time,

97
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,790
when you landed salary cap issues,

98
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,610
sexual assault allegations and challenges.

99
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,230
They had a grand final that had, you know,

100
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,509
been, I think, taken off them.

101
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,269
You come in and you're really set about cultural change.

102
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,050
You record a membership.

103
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,189
You improve the finances.

104
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,790
You get them to a grand final.

105
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,230
You must be really proud of that era.

106
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:05,430
Yeah, I am.

107
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,589
It was, you know, genuinely a dream come true for me.

108
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,889
I'd, you know, growing up watching,

109
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,269
standing on the, or sitting when I was really little,

110
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:16,709
watching Dad Coach on the,

111
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,790
sidelines at Carlisle Park,

112
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,490
iconic rugby league ground in New Zealand.

113
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,310
And then, you know, Dad and I,

114
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,230
his routine was to sit on a Sunday afternoon

115
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,649
and watch the Winfield Cup come in on a Sunday.

116
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:28,110
And, you know, to then have,

117
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,269
be able to work in that environment

118
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,910
with many of the people that I'd sat playing,

119
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,029
I sat watching play rather with Dad,

120
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,009
like the Terry Lambs, you know, that's really significant.

121
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,569
So it was a really big step.

122
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,250
It was a big career move, fulfilling a dream,

123
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,709
but recognising it came with a,

124
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,649
a fair amount of responsibility,

125
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,990
both to work for a really iconic club.

126
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,389
It did have some challenges as you pointed out.

127
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,250
And, you know, it was a,

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,269
it was a club that was not exactly

129
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,089
where the board wanted it to be.

130
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,350
And it did need some, some cultural change.

131
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,189
So, you know, all of those things, challenging,

132
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,569
but hugely exciting in the, in the challenge it presented.

133
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,550
When you walk into an organisation like that,

134
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,769
that it had its, its, its fair share of turmoil

135
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:16,370
and you are, you know,

136
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,649
trailblazing the way as the first female CEO,

137
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,230
were you conscious of that?

138
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,269
Were you, were you aware that,

139
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,110
that perhaps that was a first

140
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,930
and you needed to, to react differently?

141
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,329
Or were you just confident that your skills

142
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,050
were the right person for the time?

143
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,490
Yeah, I think there's two parts.

144
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,810
The, the best thing that the Bulldogs did for me

145
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,689
was they ran a recruitment process that,

146
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,689
you know, allegedly had 4,000 applicants.

147
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,430
And so they put me through a genuine recruitment process

148
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,209
and got down to the preferred candidate.

149
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,170
And that's, so there was no sort of risk of conversation

150
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,189
around tokenism or any of those conversations.

151
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,350
So that was a, that was a big tick from the board

152
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,069
and certainly gave me some confidence.

153
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,350
Look, you can't get out of bed every morning

154
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,430
taking the trailblazer tag with you.

155
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,850
You can't carry that weight of expectation.

156
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,930
So I've always just approached it as in wanting

157
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,610
to, to take some time to prove yourself.

158
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,709
I don't ever believe that respect and trust

159
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,829
comes with title.

160
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,889
It comes with what you do

161
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:16,149
and how you do it.

162
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,790
And how you go about engaging exactly

163
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,649
as we just talked about,

164
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,790
how you walk in the front door

165
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,110
and say g'day to the receptionist

166
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,509
and how you engage with the players

167
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,310
and every, everyone in between.

168
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,889
And that takes some time because of what you do

169
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,170
and how you go about it.

170
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,550
And then that's what slowly builds that trust.

171
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,310
And there was curiosity.

172
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,189
There was enormous amounts of curiosity

173
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,189
into who is this woman that's, that's landed.

174
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,189
You know, she's a Kiwi and, you know, the background.

175
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,149
And I, and I understand that.

176
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,790
There was a dozen, oh, there was about six

177
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,870
or eight Kiwi boys on the roster, which was helpful

178
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,110
because they made me feel really at home.

179
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,790
They started calling me auntie straight away,

180
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,250
which was a nice way to integrate into the playing group,

181
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:59,829
which is another whole level of being a CEO

182
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,250
in a sports club that is challenging

183
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,470
when that people don't necessarily understand

184
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,949
because you've got players that are much more

185
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,990
high profile than you, get paid way more than you do.

186
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,970
That's a really interesting dynamic.

187
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,470
That's not often the dynamic of a CEO.

188
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,649
No.

189
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,209
They're the most high paid and the most high profile.

190
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,670
So those are dynamics, which are not easy

191
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,589
for someone coming into this industry to understand.

192
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,529
So some good experience from Nepal helped me transition.

193
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,050
And I just was about taking it slowly

194
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,149
and recognise that I was trying to build that trust

195
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:33,809
and respect early.

196
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,929
You transitioned from there, Raelynn,

197
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,750
pretty quickly to another role as a first,

198
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,470
the first female CEO of Rugby Australia,

199
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,470
you were appointed in 2018.

200
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,049
The runner up for that role was Phil Kearns,

201
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,309
who's a legendary Wallaby,

202
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,649
as many would know,

203
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,570
two-time World Cup winning Australian legend of the sport.

204
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,830
You look back on your time there

205
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,710
and the structural difficulties that Rugby Australia

206
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,590
has got and probably still has.

207
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,029
Was it mission impossible?

208
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,309
I don't think so.

209
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,230
I think there was,

210
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,490
I identified two really key things

211
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,529
that I thought were important for Rugby Australia.

212
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,190
One was that it needed a genuine high performance structure

213
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,809
that started,

214
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:17,889
started with the young boys and girls

215
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,309
who could see themselves working their way through up

216
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,029
into becoming a Wallaby or a Wallaroo.

217
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,149
And also that had to be integrated

218
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,009
and planned with the Super Rugby teams.

219
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,289
And that was not in place.

220
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,649
All the successful countries around the world

221
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,070
had that end-to-end structure.

222
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,549
So the All Blacks in Ireland is two good examples.

223
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,090
So that was something that we focused on really hard

224
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,309
and we did manage to get to a much more inclusive state

225
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,149
by the time I left.

226
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,690
And the second one was,

227
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,990
when the broadcast deal really felt that we needed,

228
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,009
that rugby needed some exposure on free-to-air television.

229
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,110
It had been with a great partner

230
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,710
with Fox for a long period of time,

231
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,389
but all its major rivals were being,

232
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,409
you know, cricket, AFL and NRL

233
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,289
had significant amounts of free-to-air coverage.

234
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,490
And so that was a strategic problem.

235
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,909
So those two things ultimately,

236
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,570
whilst I didn't finish the broadcast deal

237
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,629
that was done after I left,

238
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,690
that was what happened.

239
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,789
They landed a free-to-air partner in broadcasting.

240
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:14,909
And, you know,

241
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,950
believed that that will help them

242
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,909
grow the engagement of the sport.

243
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,009
Raylene, the former rugby chairman, Paul McLean,

244
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,289
described your treatment at the end at Rugby Australia

245
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,649
as abhorrent bullying.

246
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,909
You were targeted.

247
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,629
High-profile media person, Alan Jones,

248
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:31,549
went after you regularly.

249
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,230
David Leckie was the CEO of Channel 7

250
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,629
and was pretty brutal in going after you at the time.

251
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,549
It was enormous pressure for one person to cope with.

252
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:40,470
How did you cope?

253
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,929
I get asked this question a lot, Luke,

254
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:43,509
and I think,

255
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,730
you know, the thing that's really difficult

256
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,090
about people that comment in the media in general

257
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,909
is often they don't have all the facts.

258
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,929
So they have a perspective, a view, an agenda possibly,

259
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,070
and that's quite difficult.

260
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,450
If you add the overlap social media into that

261
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,730
and the type of barrage I was getting on social media,

262
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,190
sure, that's from the outside really difficult.

263
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:10,090
The reality is I've got four or five trusted advisors

264
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,370
and those people,

265
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,389
they understand the detail.

266
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,509
They understand the decision-making,

267
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,250
the process,

268
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,309
the strategic approach you've gone through.

269
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,730
And when they say you've got that wrong

270
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,289
or you really seriously question me on something,

271
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,649
that's when I sit up and take notice.

272
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,570
That's when I get that sick feeling in my stomach.

273
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,169
Like anyone else that has respect for the people around them,

274
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,210
and that's, you know, the board, the board chair,

275
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,929
and then probably some people that had some distance

276
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,049
that could sit outside

277
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:45,450
and actually really knew me and what was happening.

278
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,789
So that's how I manage it.

279
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,929
Those advisors can't be the people

280
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,309
that only tell you the good stuff.

281
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,389
They have to be the people that front up

282
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:54,490
and give you the really,

283
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,190
the tough and honest feedback as well.

284
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,990
And so, yeah, like I said,

285
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,250
you have to understand the commentary

286
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,570
and the tone and the voice

287
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,090
of those sorts of things that are happening.

288
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,149
But ultimately you have to be concentrating

289
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,470
on doing what you think is right

290
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,809
with those people close around you.

291
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,889
I'm fascinated by that four or five person group

292
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,070
of trusted advisor you got.

293
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,169
And it's such sound logic for me

294
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,850
and brilliant discipline too.

295
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,029
I mean, it's easy to say it casually

296
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:26,289
that, you know, that noise is full on, isn't it?

297
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,610
And anyone, you know,

298
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,850
I certainly can't imagine walking in the shoes that you did

299
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,789
and some of the horrible, nasty treatment that you got,

300
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,809
I find appalling as well.

301
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,610
But to be able to, you know, reflect back with it,

302
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:40,710
can you give us a bit more,

303
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,570
is that something that you set up for yourself?

304
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:45,330
In life to have a mentor group effectively

305
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,230
that has been with you for a while

306
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,809
or have you just adapted given the role that you've had?

307
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,129
Have you changed that lineup at times or?

308
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,789
I mean, I have been fortunate to have some of those people

309
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,210
with me for a long period of time.

310
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,149
And I think that is important

311
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,710
because they know you well enough

312
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,190
and you trust their judgment enough,

313
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,529
I think is really important.

314
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,269
People ask me about mentoring all the time

315
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,870
and I think it's all valuable,

316
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,009
but I think you need someone

317
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,549
that shares your values and your style and your approach

318
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,529
because when you ring them and say,

319
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,029
can you help me with this?

320
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,009
You need them to sort of,

321
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,389
to be able to add value on the same path

322
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,409
where if you have someone that is totally different space,

323
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,769
then they tend to take you off in a different direction

324
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:30,870
and that can be really hard.

325
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,970
So I think that's important.

326
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:33,870
They have varied over time,

327
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,669
different people for different roles

328
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,750
and as the needs required

329
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,210
specifically for the role that you're doing.

330
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,690
I've had a couple of consistent ones

331
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,230
that I would talk to.

332
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,029
That's important.

333
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,169
I think the other thing is that

334
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,590
you're sitting in front of a group of people

335
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,990
that you're leading, an organisation, a team

336
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,870
and you have to get the read from them as well.

337
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,230
And those people,

338
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,309
if they are leaning in and are behind you

339
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,929
and where you're going and what you're doing

340
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,929
and responding to that leadership and culture

341
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,029
that you're creating,

342
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,730
not just inside the environment,

343
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,669
but further afield,

344
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,870
that's important.

345
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,009
I think the other thing is

346
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,029
if you're really determined that change needs to happen,

347
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,110
then you've got to be brave enough to stick with it.

348
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:24,269
Whether that's values-based,

349
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,809
whether that's because you clearly believe

350
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,750
the organisation needs something,

351
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,549
that's the job that you've got put in to do

352
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:35,909
and it's easy to take sometimes the easy-er option

353
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,009
or the path of least resistance, if you like,

354
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,669
but I don't think that's playing true to my own values.

355
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,710
I think that's the way to go.

356
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,330
I think that's the way to go.

357
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,289
Or you're not doing the right thing for the organisation

358
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,029
because change is hard

359
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,250
and change outside of how people like to see it

360
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,870
because they've been involved with it historically

361
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,110
is not always the way to go.

362
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,529
Yeah, I think you can't fake coping.

363
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,049
I mean, you just have to see, you know,

364
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,309
how you reacted under pressure.

365
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:04,429
And as I said, I'm delving a little bit more

366
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,789
into the group around you

367
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,809
and to digress for a moment,

368
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,230
it's a passion we've been working in the leadership space

369
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,669
and particularly in the leadership space.

370
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,409
In lockdown, we're sort of connecting different leaders

371
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,549
from different backgrounds,

372
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,809
some of them in the sporting world, Raylene,

373
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,049
you know, almost people who understand the same arena,

374
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,190
but as you said, same values.

375
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,350
You know, if you don't align on values,

376
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,830
you're probably not going to be able to support each other.

377
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,289
But, you know, it's been something

378
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,750
that we've seen been really powerful,

379
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,590
almost like your own personal board of directors

380
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,110
can come from different areas and different backgrounds.

381
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,509
So it's a space,

382
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,129
if you want to find out a bit more about it,

383
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,110
we're doing that work.

384
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,429
A leader connect is the work

385
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,629
and it sounds interesting, Raylene,

386
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,690
to hear leaders like you

387
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,929
that actually just develop that on your own

388
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:42,649
and work together.

389
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:43,950
And work your way through that.

390
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,230
I'm still just sticking on.

391
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,889
I mean, I just think it was an enormous,

392
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,889
and I love the fact that you had that in your corner,

393
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,269
but there was a time where 11 Wallaby captains

394
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,370
signed a statement, you know,

395
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,690
talking about change in leadership,

396
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,370
but you never lost your cool.

397
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,029
You know, you never got angry in a press conference.

398
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,250
I mean, was there moments behind the scenes?

399
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,809
You must have thrown something at some stage, Raylene.

400
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,389
I mean, how did you manage that?

401
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,210
Oh yeah, I mean, you do, right?

402
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,049
But that's not what anyone's looking for in a leader.

403
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,909
You know, they're looking for the person

404
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:12,610
that's calm,

405
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:13,330
and considered,

406
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,169
and thoughtful,

407
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,049
and can deal with those things.

408
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,370
And sure, there's moments where you, you know,

409
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,570
have an enormously large glass of wine

410
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,629
and drink it in one go,

411
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,710
but that's not for public consumption, you know,

412
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:27,389
because that's not what the people

413
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,549
that are sitting in front of you,

414
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,830
and it's also, you know, like I, you know,

415
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,970
in that moment around rugby,

416
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:33,909
there was, you know,

417
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,210
people that run club competitions in Darwin

418
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,389
that are looking at the leader of Rugby Australia

419
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,029
thinking that they want someone to be calm

420
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:42,230
and considerate,

421
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,210
and thoughtful under that bear arch.

422
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:46,409
They don't want someone that's attacking

423
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:51,190
and being, creating more media profile

424
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,950
around the already difficult situation

425
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,549
that, you know, that you're dealing with.

426
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,210
So on one hand, I'd say, you know, that's the reality.

427
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,110
On the other hand, I'd say that

428
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,830
at the end of the day, as a CEO,

429
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,849
it's a bit like being the captain of a sports team.

430
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,990
And when you get appointed into that role,

431
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,950
you need to make sure the coach has got your back

432
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,650
and they, you know,

433
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,470
you never have to look behind you.

434
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,109
So whilst those discussions and situations

435
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,009
are really difficult,

436
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,910
whilst you only have to worry about

437
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,170
what's coming in the front door,

438
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:23,990
you can deal with a lot.

439
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,069
The moment you realise that you haven't got

440
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,549
that support from behind you,

441
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,150
then you can't keep going

442
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,130
because it's too hard to look both ways.

443
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,809
Ultimately, that's what happened.

444
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,109
The Wallaby letter came in

445
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:39,069
and the board, you know, said to me,

446
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,970
you know, this is, you know,

447
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,650
this is a problem.

448
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,430
That was, there'd been a change in leadership

449
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,130
of the chair and the deputy chair.

450
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,670
Those people had previously been enormously supportive.

451
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,490
Paul McLean was amazing in the transition.

452
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,630
But, you know, there's a group of people

453
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,670
that want to take the organisation

454
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,769
in a different direction.

455
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,569
They see your face doesn't fit.

456
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,089
As a CEO, you shake hands and say,

457
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:01,990
thanks very much.

458
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,150
Is that hard because you feel like

459
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,910
you haven't finished the things you started off?

460
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:06,369
Sure.

461
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,170
But that comes with leadership.

462
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,509
You know, it's like I said,

463
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,490
the analogy, the captain of the sports team, right?

464
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,529
So, you have to, when you haven't, you know,

465
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,490
we haven't got their support,

466
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,309
you can't do your job.

467
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,670
And I think when you handle yourself the way you did,

468
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,470
you move on as you have now

469
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,430
to an extraordinary role as the current,

470
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,869
you know, top sports administrator

471
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:29,250
and the head of sports in New Zealand.

472
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,410
And you're right, isn't it?

473
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,529
Your behaviours and your actions

474
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:32,670
and how you cope, I suppose,

475
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,630
is where you land next in life.

476
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,789
And you deserve all the success that comes your way,

477
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,490
clearly from afar, watching the way you go.

478
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,789
One of the things I've admired about

479
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,269
reading your story in preparation for this, Raylene,

480
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:45,069
was that some of the detractors,

481
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,029
and we're talking, you know,

482
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,829
powerful people with big microphones

483
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,109
who really, it seemed, had a set for you.

484
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,450
And you went and met them face to face.

485
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,410
So, Alan Jones is a big voice in this country.

486
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,789
As a broadcaster, for those that don't understand Alan's work,

487
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:03,369
he's been, you know, a loud voice in radio

488
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:04,609
for many, many years

489
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,490
and also a former Wallabies coach

490
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,609
and clearly decided that you weren't the person for the role.

491
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:11,910
You went and sat down with him.

492
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,089
You went and sat down with Phil Kearns,

493
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:13,990
who was the runner-up in your...

494
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,170
Tell me about doing that.

495
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,049
That takes some courage.

496
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,150
Well, I suppose it does,

497
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,690
but it's the right thing to do, right?

498
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,670
I mean, you can, you know, I think it's important.

499
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,750
They were both significant contributors

500
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,730
to the history of the game in Australia

501
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,970
and they deserved an opportunity to have their say

502
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,049
and to give their feedback.

503
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:35,670
And I had that...

504
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,890
I met with, you know, 40 or 50 Wallabies

505
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,670
probably over my...

506
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,829
And I offered every single one of those Wallabies

507
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:46,529
exactly the same opportunity,

508
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,529
which was they could come and meet with me

509
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,650
or ring me, they had my phone number,

510
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,930
with any specific piece of detail they wanted at any time

511
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,309
because, in my view, they'd earned the right

512
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:57,730
to have that conversation

513
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,309
because they'd worn the gold jersey and I hadn't.

514
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,089
So that was an open invitation.

515
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,690
Ultimately, a bunch of them chose not to do that

516
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,710
and they chose to send a letter to the media

517
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,890
before the letter came to me

518
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,950
or came to the board

519
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,289
and, you know, that's the way they chose to go about it.

520
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:19,910
But, as I said, that was a process that...

521
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,369
It was a difficult course, it was.

522
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,890
I think the disappointing thing for me

523
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,369
is having tried to take conversations out of the media

524
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,869
behind closed doors and deal with our issues

525
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,210
in a professional way across a table

526
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,569
and that was how I dealt with as many things as I could

527
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,690
within Rugby Australia when that was...

528
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,890
when that's not afforded to you

529
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,710
and it becomes a public debate

530
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,210
before they sit round the table.

531
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,829
That's hard, but, you know, we were where we were.

532
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,710
Is that something that, you know,

533
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,869
transcends into other parts of your life, Raylene?

534
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,049
I mean, you mentioned that they're all wallabies

535
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,130
and they'd earned the right in your mind.

536
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,549
Have you dealt with that in your life in the past?

537
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,309
I mean, we all, you know, have run-ins

538
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,589
or disagreements with people.

539
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,609
Have you been someone that's,

540
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,509
hey, I'll meet you and sit down

541
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:07,849
in other aspects of your life as well?

542
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,630
Yeah, always.

543
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,730
I think, look, you know,

544
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,470
I don't have to like you to work with you.

545
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,829
I mean, that's the reality.

546
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,910
You can't possibly in an environment, you know,

547
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,750
end up with a long friendship

548
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,430
with every person that you work with

549
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,250
or necessarily even particularly respect the style

550
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,750
with which they go about things.

551
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:27,609
But if you're placed in a situation

552
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,529
where you need to find a way to work through that

553
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:31,210
and work forward,

554
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,930
I think that's, you know, hugely important

555
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,549
and that sort of ability to build that relationship,

556
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,670
be professional about how you go about things.

557
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,869
is really important.

558
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:44,049
And, you know, I'm really proud of the fact

559
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,390
that that's the way I approach my relationships

560
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,829
in a working environment.

561
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,930
If you didn't have enough going on in that role, Raylene,

562
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:54,630
the Israel Folau story becomes part of legend.

563
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:57,009
And I know you've spoken about this a lot,

564
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,049
but I'm interested in your reflections.

565
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,809
He's probably the most high-profile sportsman

566
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:01,609
in Australia at the time,

567
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,250
regarded as the best player in Australian rugby.

568
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,690
And he makes a series of homophobic statements

569
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,930
on social media.

570
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,130
Initially, he's cautioned by you,

571
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,910
if I get this right,

572
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,309
but he does it again.

573
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,470
And it ends up resulting in his role being sacked.

574
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,710
There's an out-of-court settlement that's agreed upon.

575
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:19,369
I mean, there was no playbook at all for this in sport,

576
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,769
probably anywhere in the world.

577
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,009
You're in the chair and it's you at the front of it.

578
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,369
I mean, how did you go about it?

579
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,630
And on reflection, is there anything you'd change?

580
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,109
I mean, you know,

581
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,710
you couldn't go through something so complex

582
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,390
and not think there was things that you'd do differently.

583
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,789
So, you know, you wouldn't be arrogant enough to say that.

584
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,450
But for all of its really significant complexity,

585
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,930
it was really quite simple.

586
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,750
There was an employee that had breached

587
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,029
their employment contract.

588
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,589
My style would always be to, you know,

589
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,910
sit down and go through a process with someone the first time,

590
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,130
regardless of who they were, you know,

591
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,309
don't make the same mistake twice kind of scenario.

592
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,269
So once, I'm really happy to sit down

593
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,009
and work through with you, but not twice.

594
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:10,769
And ultimately,

595
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,329
my role as a CEO is provide a safe working environment.

596
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,349
And that was,

597
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,269
I had many staff that didn't believe that was the case.

598
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,650
And thirdly,

599
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,730
the organisation had a set of values

600
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,690
where diversity and inclusion was, you know,

601
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:26,890
at the heart of that.

602
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,650
So if you don't stand up for those values,

603
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,269
they're not worth, you know,

604
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,329
the paper they're written on

605
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,670
or the organisation doesn't actually stand for something.

606
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,309
So whilst it was certainly complex

607
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,869
because of the, you know,

608
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:44,690
the people believed the nature of the discussion

609
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,730
was breaking new ground, you know,

610
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,829
I'm not sure it was, we had a policy,

611
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:50,849
that's where we ended up.

612
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,849
So I'm really comfortable and proud of the decision

613
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,490
that we made and that we stuck to it.

614
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,490
Certainly the board was 100% committed to that process.

615
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,029
The learning though, is that diversity and inclusion

616
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:10,849
are two words that are important.

617
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,710
Two words that are really easy to say

618
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,049
and actually much more difficult to bring together.

619
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,089
So we talk about diversity and inclusion policies,

620
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,230
diversity and inclusion rounds, you know,

621
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,410
and footy and all of that.

622
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,130
But actually the challenge of bringing

623
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,170
a whole lot of diverse people together

624
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,670
and then allowing them to be themselves

625
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,470
and be completely open and honest in their views

626
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,109
is quite a difficult leadership challenge.

627
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,630
And actually providing an environment

628
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,450
that's safe for people to share their views

629
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,549
and that they do feel included.

630
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,490
Is important.

631
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,009
And all I can say is that you need to express your views

632
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,710
in a constructive and positive way,

633
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,170
recognising that you've got colleagues or people

634
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,490
or teammates or whatever around you.

635
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,710
And if your comments make those people feel bullied

636
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,730
or unsafe, that's not an environment that can be acceptable.

637
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,630
So yeah, I think there's work needs to be done.

638
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,470
Well, I think we, as a society are much more accepting

639
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,269
of diversity and inclusion,

640
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:10,849
but actually the practical reality of delivering on the ground

641
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,930
is a little more challenging.

642
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,809
Raelynn, did you get support from the playing group

643
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:16,950
and the coaching staff?

644
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,809
I mean, as you know, in sport,

645
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,910
not every athlete's always created equal.

646
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,990
It seems from my experience of playing sport,

647
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,329
if it was player 45 that was on the edge,

648
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,650
it's an easier decision than the best player in the team,

649
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,670
maybe the best player in the world.

650
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,869
Did they understand it?

651
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,450
Did they think it was clear cut?

652
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,490
I just got to be a little bit respectful, Luke, of people,

653
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,109
in the situation and the conversations I went through.

654
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,349
What I can say is the board, really proud of the board,

655
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,349
never once said he's the best player in the world,

656
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,329
but it's difficult for a playing group,

657
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:55,750
if I talk more generally, because, you know,

658
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,829
they have friends, they share religious views

659
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,069
and it was not a religious conversation.

660
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,710
And I think that's the piece that, you know,

661
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,349
I spend a lot of time talking about

662
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,349
the fact that I was deeply proud of the fact

663
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:17,349
that we had a group of religious players

664
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,990
that they held that to the centre of themselves

665
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,809
around who they were as individuals.

666
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,930
And there was respect on both sides of the room

667
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,769
because of that.

668
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:28,849
And there was group prayer groups and the boys

669
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,069
that weren't as deeply religious were a part of that.

670
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:35,470
But unfortunately, when that's kind of not the point,

671
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,730
really, the point is that they'd lost a teammate.

672
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,009
They weren't quite sure where they were going.

673
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,049
They weren't quite sure where to land

674
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,990
because they felt that because of the media furor

675
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,410
that their base religion was being attacked,

676
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,130
which was never the point.

677
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,490
So yeah, the conversations were not straightforward.

678
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,869
And there was, you know, a range of views

679
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:00,549
from the Wallabies and the team is sacrosanct

680
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,509
and no player is bigger than the team,

681
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,130
through to some deep concern for a teammate who was,

682
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,289
you know, regardless of why they were there,

683
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,529
was in a difficult situation.

684
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,029
And so it's a very challenging and emotional time

685
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:12,769
for everyone involved.

686
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,269
Well, in my mind's going to a story you may not be aware of.

687
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,529
And it wasn't a question that I thought of answering,

688
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,390
but I love your logical brain.

689
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,690
I can see the way you work and I can see that, you know,

690
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,529
you've got values that you stick by.

691
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,150
This one to me is fascinating and I can't quite get my head around it.

692
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:34,130
AFLW player and the sport has been brilliant

693
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,369
in the world of Australian rules football,

694
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,289
the game that I played growing up, Raylene,

695
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,509
and brought diversity and brought a lot of these conversations,

696
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:41,910
to the table that hadn't been had before.

697
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,029
And I have great respect for the whole playing group in AFLW.

698
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:46,990
In the Western Sydney's team,

699
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:52,029
they have a player of Muslim faith who's become a great ambassador.

700
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:57,289
As you know, the Western part of Sydney has strong Muslim community.

701
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,710
So she's become a great ambassador,

702
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:03,650
but she wasn't prepared to play in the Pride round and wear a jumper

703
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,490
celebrating the diversity of sexual choice for one of a bit of a time.

704
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:13,170
So that story was supported, you know,

705
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,789
and supported by a lot of the other AFLW players.

706
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:20,730
Do you see that as a very different thing to what you went through with Israel Folau

707
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,750
or is there some crossover in,

708
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,390
how would you have handled that one as a CEO of the AFLW Giants?

709
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,529
Well, I don't know.

710
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,069
And one of those dangerous things,

711
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,049
I don't know enough about the specifics, right?

712
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,930
So, but what I would say is what I was talking about before

713
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,509
is that's a really large,

714
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,730
thriving, good example of where diversity and inclusion

715
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,890
sounds really easy when you put it in one sentence.

716
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:44,230
Yeah.

717
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,589
But the practical reality of applying it is greatly different.

718
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,049
So if someone comes forward and expresses their view in a respectful way,

719
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,069
explains their logic and says,

720
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,049
this for me is, I don't feel comfortable with this.

721
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,349
You couldn't be anything other than open-minded to that conversation

722
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:08,190
and supportive of that conversation, I think,

723
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,509
because it's the way you go.

724
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,650
I think the other piece that's really interesting, Luke,

725
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:17,170
is that you, more and more sports voices loud

726
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,630
around making real change in society,

727
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:26,210
but not every player signs up to be the poster child for X or Y.

728
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,230
You know, just like some won't wear,

729
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,829
don't like wearing betting sponsorship

730
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:33,529
or don't like wearing alcohol sponsorship

731
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,190
because, you know, they've got a view on that equally.

732
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,309
And I think that's an interesting challenge

733
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:39,349
in a way.

734
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:39,410
Yeah.

735
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,470
Yeah.

736
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:39,490
Yeah.

737
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:40,329
I think that's an interesting challenge in a team dynamic

738
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:44,490
where personal values, it's assumed when you wear the team uniform,

739
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,809
you should sign up for that.

740
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,329
But with some of those things,

741
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,289
more and more of those conversations are coming to the fore.

742
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,410
I love some of the work you've done in the community space as well.

743
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,009
You're the founder of the Minerva Network,

744
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,430
Women Supporting Australian Women in the Business of Sport.

745
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,549
I mean, having a look through the website

746
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:10,130
and just seeing the great amount of community

747
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,609
that you've been able to bring together.

748
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,509
Tell us about your passion for supporting other female leaders.

749
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,390
Yeah.

750
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,450
There was a group of five high-profile woman leaders

751
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,849
who were sitting around going,

752
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:23,990
the blokes look after the blokes.

753
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,910
So the senior male leaders in this country

754
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,069
reach out to the young, aspiring male athletes

755
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:31,450
and say, right, I'll introduce you to this person,

756
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:32,829
I'll introduce you to that person.

757
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,990
How could we help you go about your,

758
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,109
either pre, during your career or post your career?

759
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:40,950
So really, that's where it started from.

760
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,970
A group of us sat down and said,

761
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,289
how could we help young, aspiring female athletes

762
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:46,609
to give them the same opportunity?

763
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,349
So that Minerva Network has grown into four different chapters,

764
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,750
I think, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and WA,

765
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,190
and has, or she was about 400 female athletes,

766
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,069
all that are provided with a mentor

767
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,089
and all have the opportunity to be part of budgeting,

768
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,869
public speaking, social media management,

769
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,549
you know, post-career development,

770
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,109
all of those, you know, those types of things.

771
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,170
So, you know, the group have done an amazing job

772
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,630
in supporting that female network.

773
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,950
And interestingly, those athletes now get a chance

774
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,170
to mix those athletes together,

775
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:26,009
which wasn't always something they got the opportunity to do.

776
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,190
So, I mean, I think any way that you can help,

777
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,650
you know, provide opportunities for that to happen

778
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,509
is hugely important, whether it's, you know,

779
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,670
last week I had a phone call from a young, aspiring,

780
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,230
or actually a radio DJ here in New Zealand

781
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,009
rang me and said, listen, I've got a young, aspiring person

782
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:44,450
that wants to work in broadcast.

783
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,170
Would you mentor her?

784
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,990
And I said, well, I won't mentor her

785
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,470
because I think that's a really big commitment,

786
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:51,049
but I will have a coffee with her.

787
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,910
So, you know, I sat down here now,

788
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,750
I had a coffee with her and just, you know,

789
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,710
sort of helped her organise her thoughts, I suppose,

790
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,589
in a way that, you know,

791
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,789
could help her take the next steps in her career.

792
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,329
So, I mean, I think any opportunity to do that

793
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,609
and give back is really important

794
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,289
because I know I was fortunate to have some of those people

795
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:11,450
do that for me when I was younger.

796
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,890
It sounds like formalising mentoring

797
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,430
has been a big part of your career.

798
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,349
It's been a big part of your life and your leadership.

799
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,069
Can you share a bit more?

800
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,109
You just said then you were on the receiving end

801
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,910
of some great support and mentors.

802
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,930
Have you got a name that you could share

803
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,089
or is there an example of someone who went out of their way

804
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,150
to really have your back at various stages?

805
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,509
Yeah, the person probably, you know,

806
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:38,630
I have a main probably mentor, David Jackson.

807
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:40,210
He's an Aussie.

808
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,809
He was running, sitting in New Zealand,

809
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:43,990
running Kiwi Rail.

810
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,170
And I was with the Toll organisation,

811
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:53,190
which is a really big organisation as a CEO in Australia.

812
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,509
But I think the biggest alignment is, as I said earlier,

813
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,269
we've got some shared values and approach

814
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,470
in how we go about things.

815
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:03,049
So whenever I, and, you know, as an example,

816
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,890
when he was here as CEO of Kiwi Rail,

817
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,309
he would go to the very top of North Island

818
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,730
and get in the train with the train driver

819
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,309
and spend the whole trip from, you know,

820
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,650
Cape Reinga to Bluff, basically, in a train,

821
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,869
talking to the train driver.

822
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,390
And he'd get all the goss, right?

823
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:22,049
The train driver knew who, what was happening,

824
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,890
what was working well, what wasn't working well,

825
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,369
what was performing, you know, where the opportunities are.

826
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,309
And that, to me, is, you know,

827
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:31,910
the sort of guy that I want to work, you know, closely with.

828
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,309
And so he's been really, really kind to me.

829
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,170
We've had some great conversations,

830
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:37,690
some really good challenging conversations.

831
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,829
He's, you know, helped me through some difficult times

832
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,970
and, you know, I enormously value his input.

833
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,250
Yeah, we've heard that.

834
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,410
It's a great story to hear, Rolaine.

835
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,549
Brian McNamee on this podcast,

836
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,970
who was the legendary CEO of CSL,

837
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:53,690
that took that to, you know, the biggest company by market cap.

838
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,190
I mean, that was what he said routinely he did.

839
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,210
Didn't book meetings in his diary, just wanted to walk.

840
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,509
You know, ended up with 40,000 employees, CSL worldwide,

841
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,069
but just wanted to walk and talk, walk past people's desks,

842
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,089
find out from someone obscure about what was happening,

843
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,570
you know, in the inner sanctum of the organisation,

844
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,190
you know, rather than the old version of hierarchy,

845
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,789
which is really...

846
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:14,829
Passion for leadership, we're talking about.

847
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,650
Geoff Harris, who founded Flight Centre recently,

848
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,429
the same thing, you know, walking into the stores

849
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:24,030
and finding out from those at the lowest rungs of the organisation

850
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,090
who was the most beneficial.

851
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,489
And have you found that's really related to you

852
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,250
as you've gone on in your working life as well?

853
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,909
Yeah, it has.

854
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,349
And I have to say, it's my single biggest frustration about COVID

855
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:37,309
is the fact that you get, you know, last year,

856
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:40,090
I had four months at my dining room table in Auckland

857
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,150
because Auckland was in lockdown, dealing with, you know,

858
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,449
the people that I obviously had to deal with on a daily basis,

859
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,809
40 hours of Zoom calls,

860
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,650
but actually no capability to get that physical

861
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,289
and environmental contact that I really find rewarding

862
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:57,070
from a job point of view.

863
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,489
And, you know, be able to get a sense of walking past someone

864
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,409
and saying, how's your mum or how's your dog

865
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,570
or did you win footy in the weekend

866
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,190
or what did you think of the Grand Prix in the weekend?

867
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,730
Wasn't that a great performance?

868
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,389
Those are the types of things that you can really get.

869
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:13,050
You can taste it and smell it.

870
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:15,030
Around the culture of an organisation.

871
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,570
But if you're not doing that because you're locked behind a screen in COVID,

872
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,949
that's really, really, really challenging.

873
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,809
And as we start to move back into an environment

874
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:26,190
where we want people to come back into the office

875
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,309
to have that human connection,

876
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,150
that's a real cultural challenge for a lot of organisations

877
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,210
where people and staff have got used to working from home.

878
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,429
It suits their lifestyle better.

879
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,949
They realise that they've got more flexibility

880
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:40,769
and it might be better for the individual rather,

881
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:43,130
but it's more challenging for the organisation.

882
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:45,409
So I think that's a real challenge facing leaders

883
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,670
as we emerge out of this COVID world.

884
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,010
Have you got an idea on that quickly?

885
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,150
I mean, that is the ultimate challenge everyone's now, isn't it?

886
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,630
Trying to, people don't want to mandate things anymore

887
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,070
and legislate days you've got to be in the office.

888
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,650
But clearly we need people interacting more together.

889
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,769
I mean, have you got a system at Sport New Zealand in mind

890
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:06,869
of how you're going to manage that?

891
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,630
Yeah, I think there'll be a balance.

892
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,489
I think it'll be three in the office and two at home flexibility.

893
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:12,929
So, you know, that allows you

894
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:13,869
to have that flexibility,

895
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,889
but recognise that there is real value

896
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:19,309
in those, you know, conversations

897
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:22,130
or osmosis type information that you pick up

898
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,349
when you're not necessarily there,

899
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,369
but you're around people.

900
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,289
So that's probably the way

901
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,590
that we're looking to work towards it.

902
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,929
And it'll be interesting to see how it unfolds.

903
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,550
Well, then we're identifying with the leaders

904
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,590
we're talking to a range of different leadership traits

905
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,230
that we think are unique to leaders

906
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,429
that are evolving in this way.

907
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:42,829
And we see you very much in that light.

908
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:45,630
And so I was going to ask you a range of these questions.

909
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:47,969
So please expand as much as you like.

910
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:49,489
Starting with self-leadership,

911
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,309
we feel like great leaders really have an idea

912
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,710
of what their own sense of self-leadership means.

913
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:56,030
How would you describe yours?

914
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,630
I mean, I think I said at the top,

915
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:02,989
maybe authentic, I think is really important.

916
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:06,449
And not being so sanitised

917
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:08,469
that you don't show your own emotion.

918
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:12,570
Like there's a difference between being really angry.

919
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,849
And really quiet, angry and quiet.

920
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:15,849
That's not the same thing.

921
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,369
But the authenticity of challenging

922
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,070
and sharing that I think is important.

923
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:25,570
But recognising that the resilience to underpin that

924
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,769
is really critical.

925
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,349
And not everyone has the resilience, right?

926
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,329
It's just, it's the reality.

927
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,250
Not everyone can survive on four hours sleep.

928
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:36,210
Not everyone can get off a 24-hour flight home from the UK

929
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,949
and go to work in the office and front up

930
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:41,170
and be sensible and talk stringy sentences together

931
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,909
and deal with really difficult questions.

932
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:45,010
And not take it to bed with you at night.

933
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,530
You know, it is a somewhere between an innate,

934
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,670
be it, you know, what's inside you as a person

935
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,289
and learned behaviour.

936
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:53,230
I think it's a combination.

937
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:57,030
But, you know, for me, those are the couple of things

938
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,070
that I think are really important.

939
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,409
Yeah, and they shine out in all of your examples

940
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:02,309
of your working life.

941
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,610
We see leaders really conscious

942
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,829
of how they positively impact others in their environment.

943
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,670
I think you've given some great examples

944
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,570
of just the day-to-day and the engagement

945
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,809
and talking to people at all.

946
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:12,869
Yeah.

947
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:15,329
All levels of the businesses and organisations you've been in.

948
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,530
How do you go about positively impacting others?

949
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,489
I worked for a guy in my very first job.

950
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:24,909
I was an enthusiastic marketing graduate

951
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:27,889
that was, you know, looking to, I suppose,

952
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,369
you know, take on the world, if you like.

953
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:34,250
And he was a very experienced Xerox executive

954
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,349
that had come from the UK.

955
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,409
And I'd go into his office with this idea

956
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,070
and I'd be like, I've just been thinking

957
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,849
and I reckon we can do this and this and this.

958
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:42,349
What do you think?

959
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:46,070
And I always left his office better off

960
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,050
than when I went in there.

961
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:50,469
So I always had value added to the thought.

962
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,650
He told me you should go and talk to this person.

963
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,869
Maybe if you just tweak that and go about it this way.

964
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,070
So it's something I've really thought about

965
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,309
and that when someone comes and approaches me

966
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:03,570
with something, an idea, a thought, you know, whatever,

967
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,929
that hopefully I can send them away

968
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,489
just a little bit more knowledgeable

969
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:09,809
or point them in a little bit better direction

970
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:10,889
than when they arrived in.

971
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,869
And, you know, like I said,

972
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:15,030
he taught me that right from my very first job.

973
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,690
And you can always identify

974
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,710
when someone's just not listening to you, can't you?

975
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,809
It's pretty deflating, even if the idea doesn't get up.

976
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,150
The idea that someone's actually genuinely listening

977
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,530
and maybe that can be transformative resonates with me.

978
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,949
How have you gone about creating and sharing your vision

979
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,750
in the various roles that you've had?

980
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,750
I think you've got a front.

981
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,329
That's the thing.

982
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:39,230
You've got to have strong values

983
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,070
and be prepared to share those values.

984
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:46,889
Or vision or plan or change environment

985
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:50,409
or, you know, reset, whatever it is that you're doing.

986
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,929
You've got to be able to talk to that in plain language

987
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,949
that people that understand in the way

988
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:00,090
that most people are going to be able to relate to.

989
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,889
You know, there's lots of big and fancy words

990
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:04,630
that you can use, but I don't think you need to use them

991
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,969
if you can just use really sort of straight and plain ones.

992
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,670
And, you know, then be prepared to back that up.

993
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,510
I think with one,

994
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,429
with your own actions,

995
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,869
but also have difficult conversations

996
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,590
and call people out if they're not behaving

997
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,210
in the way that you expect or,

998
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,329
and not everyone can have difficult conversations.

999
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:27,110
Not everyone feels confident to make the hard decision

1000
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,829
and then actually, you know, follow it through.

1001
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,389
So, you know, those, but people watch that, right?

1002
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:36,610
And they see that not only are you prepared to front up

1003
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,829
and say, this is what we're going to do

1004
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:39,110
and this is how we're going to go there.

1005
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,829
And then you work to take the people with you,

1006
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:43,929
but you're also prepared to actually make

1007
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,510
the difficult decisions to get to that point.

1008
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:49,809
So, yeah, that combination is important.

1009
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,210
We see curiosity as a common theme that's coming up

1010
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,010
in leaders that we're talking to and working with,

1011
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:59,369
Raylene, and often curiosity is the launching pad

1012
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,909
for how people approach their learning and development.

1013
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,570
Does that sentiment resonate with you?

1014
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:06,389
It definitely does.

1015
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,369
There's no doubt that curiosity is something

1016
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:11,769
I think is actually interesting.

1017
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,690
One of the values here at Sport New Zealand is to be curious.

1018
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:19,050
I think I'd also put with that as being brave enough

1019
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,090
to employ people that are smarter than you,

1020
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,949
technical experts that are better than you,

1021
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:26,349
ultimately being brave enough to surround yourself

1022
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:30,909
with true excellence and trust that you can lead those people.

1023
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:37,010
And I see other leaders who squash potential,

1024
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,469
won't promote people because they feel threatened,

1025
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,809
where I've seen the best leaders,

1026
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:44,449
that I've worked for, actually promote that expertise

1027
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:47,389
and bring it to the table and back themselves

1028
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:51,329
to lead people through the challenge, the strategy,

1029
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,449
strategic direction or whatever it is in front of you.

1030
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,530
So, I've got some really good examples of that.

1031
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,289
It's something I try really hard to do and ultimately know

1032
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,309
that you might be employing that person that will replace you one day.

1033
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:05,409
But that self-awareness, I think, is hugely important

1034
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,269
and really valued by the people around you.

1035
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,309
Yeah, certainly.

1036
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,710
It makes a lot of sense as well, doesn't it?

1037
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,710
But there are qualities that...

1038
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,309
Others don't have, isn't it?

1039
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,369
Again, I use the word courage again, isn't it?

1040
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,130
To put someone in place that, as you said,

1041
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,710
potentially could be your replacement.

1042
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:22,829
But in the end, so much success comes from that.

1043
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,710
You've had big roles where communication,

1044
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:27,929
in fact, all the roles, communicating with clarity

1045
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:30,969
is something that we really see as consistent to a lot of leaders.

1046
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,829
How have you put thought into the way you communicate?

1047
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,710
Well, it is really important because if that message can be clear

1048
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,710
and people understand it, then I think that helps people

1049
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:46,090
come with you or follow you or agree to make the change

1050
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,050
that you need them to make.

1051
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:56,550
So the thought and that sort of authenticity of, you know,

1052
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,389
like sometimes when you've got a really...

1053
00:42:58,389 --> 00:42:59,570
And I get this feedback a lot.

1054
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:02,829
Sometimes you've got a really complicated message to deliver

1055
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:04,969
and you can't afford to miss anything.

1056
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,210
You know, you might read out something that someone's prepared for you.

1057
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,210
But by far and away, people...

1058
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,730
The feedback I get is you're much better

1059
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,050
if you just take the high-level things

1060
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,969
and you put it in your own words and talk to it.

1061
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,750
So sometimes I've got to be careful with that

1062
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,570
because if you don't get the key messages across,

1063
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,489
that can be a risk.

1064
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,389
So I often will talk to something

1065
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:26,869
and then follow up with a written document

1066
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,730
so that we cover off those specifics.

1067
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:35,050
But the, you know, like I said, I've used the word a lot,

1068
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,409
but the authenticity of actually putting it in your own words

1069
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,230
and looking directly at people

1070
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,809
and giving them your version of it,

1071
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:43,989
ultimately resonates much more strongly

1072
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,909
than standing up and reading a document

1073
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:46,969
from what's in front of you.

1074
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:49,449
Yeah, you get a real sense of your values, Raylene.

1075
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,510
In all your answers, it's really clear what you stand for.

1076
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,110
We see collaboration now as something that, you know,

1077
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,510
leaders really value and really seek out.

1078
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,070
I mean, how important is collaboration to you?

1079
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:04,730
Well, I don't see a world where you can be successful without it

1080
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,030
because to think that your organisation is an individual,

1081
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,650
your team has all the answers would be pretty crazy.

1082
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:15,610
So, you know, the ability to collaborate

1083
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,750
and being open-minded to the challenge

1084
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,210
that collaboration brings,

1085
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:22,630
and that requires you to be comfortable

1086
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,809
not controlling everything.

1087
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,269
So, you know, once again,

1088
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,090
comfortable that you can add value to that situation

1089
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,750
when you might have a collaboration of two organisations.

1090
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,010
And there's space for all of us, you know,

1091
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,269
in a lot of these, you know, examples.

1092
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,230
And that openness to bring forward

1093
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,789
that collaboration,

1094
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,690
and have positive tension.

1095
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,489
I like to call it constructive tension.

1096
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,750
So the tension that creates of different ideas coming together

1097
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,969
and what makes it uncomfortable

1098
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:55,889
is ultimately what moves things forward.

1099
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,150
If you continue to sit in that comfortable space

1100
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,110
where there's no challenge,

1101
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,710
then you don't get that forward movement.

1102
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,170
Yeah, great answer.

1103
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,449
Two final questions that I've been asking consistently, Raylene.

1104
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,329
The first one is, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1105
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,429
My parents.

1106
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,710
My greatest leaders, really.

1107
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,309
The values that they gave my brother and I,

1108
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,230
Ryan and I.

1109
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,769
The thing, the very practical things that they taught us.

1110
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,869
The resilience they built,

1111
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,030
and the fact they never treated me any different to Ryan

1112
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,369
or Ryan any different to me.

1113
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:32,230
They were just about do your best,

1114
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,570
put yourself out there,

1115
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,769
have a really good, honest crack at it,

1116
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,530
is really the expectation, you know,

1117
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,769
honestly lean into something.

1118
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:40,710
If you're going to do it, do it properly,

1119
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:41,650
those types of things.

1120
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,829
So, you know, they certainly,

1121
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,090
and they've both been very successful in their own rights as well.

1122
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,750
You know, good work ethic, manners, shake hands well,

1123
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,250
look people in the eye, firm handshake,

1124
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:55,550
you know, all of those types of things,

1125
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,030
which all sounds very sort of,

1126
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,090
but I'm astounded today at how that's not a thing

1127
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,369
the way it should be.

1128
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,769
So I think, you know, those base values are really important.

1129
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:09,849
And I, you know, we just had an amazing start to our life

1130
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,789
because of the values that mum and dad,

1131
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:12,650
they instilled in us.

1132
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,269
Yeah, the older you get when you've been lucky enough as I was,

1133
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:18,349
and clearly you were,

1134
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,389
you realise what a gift that is, isn't it?

1135
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,949
To start your life with incredible parents as role models

1136
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,369
and certainly feeling that bracket.

1137
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,929
And it's a common answer and you can just,

1138
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,630
people don't hesitate when I ask that question of them

1139
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,750
when they've clearly had the upbringing that you have.

1140
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,690
In the spirit of collaboration,

1141
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,889
we're really passionate about this world of collaboration.

1142
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:40,690
If you could collaborate with anyone in any area of your life,

1143
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,650
you know, I think that would be fantastic.

1144
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,690
It doesn't have to be work.

1145
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,769
Is there a name that springs to mind?

1146
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,909
Oh my goodness, there's so many.

1147
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:54,010
But I have an enormous respect for Oprah.

1148
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:59,309
You know, her background, what she dealt with,

1149
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:02,050
how she's stepped through all of that, been successful.

1150
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,210
She's been inclusive with the people she's had around her

1151
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,570
and taken other people on the journey

1152
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,489
and delivered success and support

1153
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:13,650
for those people and then ended up backing them

1154
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,769
into opportunities and helping them grow their careers.

1155
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:19,190
So, you know, I'm sure it's not always as bright and shiny

1156
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,170
as it looks on the outside.

1157
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,250
There will have been enormous challenges for her,

1158
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,690
but, you know, I see a lot of the things that she's done

1159
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,170
and how she's gone about things.

1160
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,530
There's a lot to like there and a lot to learn from.

1161
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,409
The opportunity to work closely with her would be amazing.

1162
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,809
If you've got any chance of hooking me up, I'd appreciate that.

1163
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,590
I'm sure Oprah's listening, Raylene.

1164
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,329
I've got no doubt.

1165
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,170
And we'll get onto that.

1166
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,130
I love the fact that, you know, you went to that place.

1167
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:49,730
We've had, you know, guests talk about Elon Musk

1168
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,110
or, you know, people that are inspiring.

1169
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,989
We've moved the needle, haven't they, on a world scale?

1170
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,070
And clearly she has.

1171
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,150
She's spent a bit of time here in Australia, Raylene.

1172
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,250
So you never know in the spirit of collaboration.

1173
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:01,829
I'd love to see the two of you get together

1174
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:04,670
because the thing that just pours out of spending some time

1175
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,789
with your authenticity, your resilience,

1176
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:07,769
the way you've handled yourself,

1177
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,750
under pressure that very few people, I think,

1178
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,150
would even know.

1179
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,849
And to be standing from afterwards

1180
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,170
and to see you so clear on your values

1181
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,170
is a great example of leadership.

1182
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:18,630
It's been a real pleasure to meet you, Raylene.

1183
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,570
And thanks for inspiring so many others.

1184
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:21,750
Thanks, Luke.

1185
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:22,309
Thanks for having me.

1186
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:23,010
I've really enjoyed it.

1187
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,900
Empowering Leaders was presented by me, Luke Darcy,

1188
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:29,219

Listener.
