1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,370
A really enlightening conversation with Reggie Butler,

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,949
one of the world's most respected leaders in connecting teams

3
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,509
and developing great people.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,370
Reggie gives us the inside word on his work with Google

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,510
and the research that Google has done into their highest performing teams.

6
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,989
Clearly a data-driven company that knows how the most productive teams work.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,609
He shares the two words that Google used to describe

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,189
their highest and best performing teams

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,729
and how you need to bring that same culture to your life and your workplace.

10
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,909
Worth listening to this conversation for that alone.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,890
He also shares his daily practice of helping other people

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,890
and he says it's something we all need to add to our own daily routine.

13
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,670
Reggie talks about the five life domains that govern all of our lives,

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,289
work, health, family, spirituality and community.

15
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:01,649
He also asked me to name in order the way I prioritise those five life domains,

16
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,689
which was an enjoyable experience.

17
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,870
It's people like Reggie Butler who inspire the work that we do at Alita.

18
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,469
We'd love you to have a look at our work at alitacollective.com.

19
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,189

00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,069
where we connect diverse and different leaders around the globe

21
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:21,590

24
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,590
I'd love to have a chat to you about Alita Connect.

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,629
Huge thanks once again to the team at Temp.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,930
for their ongoing support of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

27
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,530
It is brilliant to have them on board supporting conversations

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,709
like this one with Reggie Butler.

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,829
We know one of the great success leave clues moments

30
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,969
is great leaders have a great sleep routine.

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,689
Investing in a bed like Temp is a life-changing decision.

32
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,189
It's a mattress like no other.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,500
Reggie Butler is the founder and CEO of Performance Paradigm,

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,680
an executive education human capital consultancy,

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,400
a learning architect, former adjunct professor,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,180
and inclusionist.

37
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,359
He's an inclusion champion with an established record

38
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,159
of delivering high-energy motivational experiences

39
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,139
for both personal and team improvement.

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,419
He has worked with many clients across a range of industries,

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,039
financial services, tech, non-profits, consumer products,

42
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,680
and professional services.

43
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,259
In addition, Reggie Butler spends time at the intersection

44
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,639
of racial justice, law enforcement, and NGOs.

45
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,280
His experience runs through equity, inclusion, diversity,

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,360
high-performing teams, executive coaching,

47
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,479
and leadership effectiveness.

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,360
He facilitates experiences and dialogues focused on how we can be better humans

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,099
and collectively improve the human condition,

50
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,500
starting with the people we are most proximate to every day

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,699
and the systems those humans create.

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,419
Reggie is the go-to person in this space for some of the biggest

53
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,939
organizations in the world, the likes of Google, Mercedes-Benz,

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,099
Kraft Heinz, Amazon, Nestle, eBay, just to name a few.

55
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,840
Reggie, it's a great honor and privilege to spend some time with you today.

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
You know, thanks for asking.

57
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:11,060
I know a little bit about you and your rise to being a better human over time,

58
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,400
even after your ACL injury.

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,340
So I want to talk about how people need to learn how to adapt.

60
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,340
Well, Reggie, let me start there because what does it mean to you to be a better human?

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,379
So one of the things is I believe this wholeheartedly,

62
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,939
that we can all do a better job of, and I use a mantra,

63
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,400
and I even have a podcast about it.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
It's called Care More.

65
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,240
It's a wonderful podcast, by the way.

66
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,860
And what I tell people is that we can all be better, do better, and care more.

67
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,780
And we are in an age right now, it's really fascinating, Luke,

68
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,360
we're in an age right now where unless you're paying attention,

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,479
we will stay apart from another human because we are conditioned

70
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,680
that we're not supposed to be in their spaces for whatever reason.

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,719
It's a set of learned behaviors, it's the psychology or the sociology of it all.

72
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,139
But we don't think about the human connection

73
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,000
until second, third, or last in our priorities of life.

74
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,460
And I'm trying to get people to sort of hear the message,

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,020
I need you to look up and look around you and pay attention

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,040
to the humans around you and see how you can be helpful.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,300
And Reggie, that is an interesting thing.

78
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,579
It's, you know, in Australia, you know, in rural areas,

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,959
I grew up in a country, small town of a couple thousand,

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,500
and you knew everyone and you said hello to everyone

81
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,839
walking down the street.

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,120
And if you drove your car,

83
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,500
sometimes great distances, you'd wave to every car

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,980
because there was an assumption that that might be someone you'd know.

85
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,379
I love playing this game now in the park where I live,

86
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,680
where I look up and I try and say hello.

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,639
The amount of people that do everything they can to avoid eye contact now

88
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,019
and saying hello is quite disturbing.

89
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,540
Is that part of the phenomenon that worries you,

90
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,300
that people genuinely try and avoid any sort of connection?

91
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,620
Yeah, and there's a little bit of research to bear that out.

92
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,019
And it's a little bit of generational news.

93
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:08,459
So to speak, but when COVID happened and we were all put into isolation

94
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,360
and it was for our own good and you sort of look at it that way.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,980
And I know what you all did in Australia.

96
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,899
I want you to think about what it did to the human connection.

97
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,959
So if we were isolated and we had to work through our own machinations of life on our own,

98
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,060
whether it's family, whoever it was with,

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,120
when it came time to come back to work,

100
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,939
you realize we lost the human connection muscle.

101
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,019
People just stopped using it.

102
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,360
So think about those people who were in a workforce before COVID happened.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,259
They were used to making connections with people,

104
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,720
whether it was in between meetings or like you say,

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,500
just being about out in the world and you would make eye contact,

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,019
you would talk to people.

107
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,120
COVID happened and everybody was isolated.

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,939
When you come back into an environment, I call it return to life.

109
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:58,480
So in the sort of RTO of it all, people came back and forgot how to do that.

110
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,439
Think about that. Think about those people,

111
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,040
who were hired remotely during COVID,

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,560
never went into an office ever.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,399
Now they're being asked for whatever reason,

114
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,220
based on company protocols and things,

115
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,560
to be a part of a team.

116
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,240
How do I become a part of a team that I was never connected to physically?

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,279
Take that same formula and think about what most of us do in our life and our day-to-day.

118
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,839
When we wake up,

119
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,000
we always connect with the people we already know,

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,560
that we're already familiar with.

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,439
And if we're not careful,

122
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,720
careful we won't pay attention or to your point even make eye contact with certain people yet

123
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,879
they're in our space so what we've got to start to do is start to pay attention to who we're paying

124
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,399
attention to and who we are not and that is super critical for the for the improvement of the human

125
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,660
condition moving forward and reggie i live in a city called melbourne which held the title as the

126
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,240
as the most locked down city in the world i i think right through to the end and and i love your

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,399
narrative and i'm happy to that perhaps that was for our own good but i had four children at school

128
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,639
who missed two years of school living in our house and watching teenagers have two-year gaps around

129
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,360
social connection you can see that is a gap that you have as you describe it's a muscle you've got

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,860
to relearn having been trained to your screen and that's where you connect online and and you lose

131
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,220
the skill of actually connecting in person it's a it's going to be a fascinating stage

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,000
i think reggie isn't it to see what's happened to that generation that's missed those pretty

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,600
vital couple of years of their teenage life yeah and you know what else luke i'd have to share this

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,560
i was talking to a colleague and we were talking about the social connections that people make now

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,259
they're not in the physical world they're in the digital world so we've created this new muscle

136
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,139
of being digitally connected to someone in a virtual way and it had become very comfortable

137
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,160
without human interaction people who go to the grocery and you know how there's these

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,899
self-checkout lines where you don't have to interact with a human there is a study that's

139
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,019
out there i won't name it yet because all the findings aren't out but here's what it suggests

140
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:15,160
is disturbing yet not at the same time that if you ask a person if you were to go to a grocery

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,680
store where you get your grocery and there was a self-checkout person a self-checkout station

142
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,540
or a person to help you check out which would you choose and they said they could tell by generation

143
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,199
who would rather interact

144
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,399
with the human. And it was really fascinating because people who were, and I'll use the term

145
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,240
boomers for now, but boomers would love to interact with a person, even though there's a

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,100
self-checkout option that's supposed to be more efficient. You know what the surprising part was?

147
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,320
Gen Xers are the generation that's coming into the workforce now. They would prefer the

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,779
self-checkout to the point where, and this is where it gets so fascinating, is that that store

149
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,980
chain removed the self-checkout option. They would rather switch stores that have to interact

150
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,740
with a human. I'm like, wait, that's the people that we're asking to make stronger human connections

151
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,659
because their normative behavior based on how they were raised in this current society. So I'm

152
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:20,700
going to take your kids during COVID and unless you give them a reason to interact, they've already

153
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,899
learned how to not interact. It's fascinating.

154
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:25,460
Fascinating.

155
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:25,759
And I'm going to take your kids during COVID and unless you give them a reason to interact,

156
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:25,779
they've already learned how to not interact. It's fascinating.

157
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,779
And again, I put the parenting hat on Reggie because you're having these conversations and

158
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,980
without naming one of my four, but you had a problem trying to enroll in a course

159
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,480
and I just said, you pick up the phone and ring. And she was like, what? I've just named her because

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,659
we've got three boys and one girl. But she was like, what are you talking about? Like, no way.

161
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:52,580
There's no way I'll email, I'll text, but I'm not picking up the phone. And I was just sort of

162
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,299
stunned. But you've probably got to understand that

163
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:00,980
that behavior hasn't been learned. It's not how they've communicated in the past. And we see that

164
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,240
it is something that you've got to go back and teach. And look, you do that, as I mentioned in

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,860
the intro, with some of the biggest organizations in the world. You teach leadership development,

166
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,519
you teach about team and human connection. You do it in a really profound way. It's seen sometimes,

167
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:20,059
Reggie, as this sort of, okay, we'll do this because it's light and fluffy and we tick a box.

168
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:25,259
But what we know, the research tells us, organizations that do this well make more money,

169
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,340
they're more profitable, they keep their staff longer. The data is irrefutable,

170
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,120
but there's still a lot of organizations that don't get it. Is that what you're still finding?

171
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,940
Hands down, we're still finding that. What we have also started to notice is that there are

172
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:48,019
organizations who've always been centered on the human condition as they do their work. And those

173
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,820
organizations are some of the most attractive companies to work for because they didn't change

174
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,019
their formula. What's interesting is that there are a lot of organizations that don't do that.

175
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:55,240
There are a lot of organizations that don't do that. There are a lot of organizations that don't

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,740
change their formula. What we have also found is that there are a lot of organizations that don't

177
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,440
change their formula. What we have also found is that there are a lot of organizations that don't

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,100
of how this new world is shaping itself, there's not a lot of incentives to be connected. Because

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,879
if I can hit my targets, think about that, as a person working for a company, if I can hit my

180
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,559
targets and I don't have to interact with somebody as much as I used to have to based on old

181
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,700
protocols and old ways of getting business done, you realize unless somebody gives me a reason to,

182
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:25,000
I will naturally not, not because I don't want to, it's because I don't have to. I do a lot of

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,440
executive coaching and there was an executive who said, you know, what's concerning to me is that

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:38,419
how my workforce connects with one another in order to problem solve looks very different now

185
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:43,840
because they don't problem solve together. They problem solve alone. So they go search,

186
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,620
they use confirmation bias to see what they want. They align and have their own fully

187
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,519
vetted points of view. Then they come into a room and try to collaborate, but they've already

188
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,059
made their mind up based on doing the research by themselves. So I want you to think about that,

189
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:06,100
Luke. If there's so much knowledge available to me that I can problem solve by myself and come up

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,960
with what I think is the best recommendation without actually having a conversation with

191
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,039
somebody, you realize what that's going to do to that team over time. You're going to have less

192
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,980
people talking, more people feeling isolated, and not a lot of innovation. And that's what frightens

193
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,360
me about us moving into the future.

194
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,600
Our innovation is through human connection alongside other parallel things that we have to

195
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,120
do in our workforce. But unless we pay attention to it, we won't connect. We've got to pay attention

196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,919
to that. You know, I got a question for you, Luke. You've been in your field for quite some time and

197
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,179
over at some point you had to change your own personal style. What was the trigger? What

198
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:52,940
happened to you to make you say, you know what, how I'm doing things as a leader or being a role

199
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,519
manager? How did you change that? Because it's no longer relevant. What happened to you?

200
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,700
Well, it's a great question, Reggie. And I think the curiosity for me is just that desire to follow

201
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,500
things that you love. And that's why it resonates so much with your work, this idea of wanting to

202
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,460
be a better person. And I think that happens to me, you know, when you become a parent and you

203
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,279
get this great mirror back up to you of these four human beings. And I'm always going, that's

204
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,500
definitely my wife's behavior. That tantrum wasn't mine. That has to change. And I think that's

205
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,000
still come from Beck. And the reality is you get to see all of your own faults really, really

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,919
clearly as a parent. And you either ignore them or you want to self-reflect and get better. And I

207
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,879
think that to me is that constant, the Japanese line, I think Keizan is constant, never-ending

208
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,220
self-improvement is the way the Japanese think about life. And I think about it the same way.

209
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,720
And it takes you down different paths and you're never not constantly trying to improve. It's why

210
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,500
I think what you're doing is so profound in so many ways.

211
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:00,519
And I love that you're getting into organizations that get it. And I want to come back to Google

212
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,940
because they're fascinating to me. Clearly, that's a company that knows data pretty well. And they

213
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,980
know how to measure things really well. So they're not mucking around at the shallow end. They're

214
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,159
going straight for the most effective. And you tell me if I'm right, I believe this study's

215
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,799
now quite well known out of Google where they studied their most effective teams

216
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,419
because they can. And they went, well, who's performing the best and why? And I understand

217
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,740
correct me if I'm wrong. The two words they came up with, their most high-performing effective teams

218
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,159
were in a psychologically safe environment were the two words they used. Can you elaborate on

219
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,919
that? Why that works and why that means so much to an organization like that?

220
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,039
Yeah. So if I look at human connection and look at the psychological safety as the underpinning

221
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,039
for why a person feels safe enough to connect with you, let's talk about psychological safety,

222
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,960
where I am in an environment where I feel psychologically safe enough

223
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,700
to share an idea without fear of embarrassment or rejection or it impacting my career.

224
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,940
And every time I do sessions where I talk about psychological safety, I talk about it in the

225
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,559
context of there are levels that look different to people around the globe. And there's a cultural

226
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,399
nuance to it. Most people just use the umbrella term of psychological safety. What Google found

227
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,340
and what a lot of organizations that have really done the good work of leadership is they found

228
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,940
that psychological safety in its four levels is the best way to get people to connect with you.

229
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,740
levels. One of them is inclusion safety. And inclusion safety means that I believe, Luke,

230
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,820
that I am in an environment where I feel like I belong and I am connected to. That means I have

231
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,419
inclusion safety. The second level is learner safety. It's where a person believes they're

232
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:46,799
in an environment and on a team and working with a leader where they feel like they are learning

233
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,120
something. That means I have learner safety. Then their third level is contributor safety.

234
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,120
I feel like I'm on a team with a leader, with a person that I feel like my voice will be heard.

235
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,519
I am a contributor. And then there's challenger safety, where I feel like I'm in an environment

236
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,879
where I can challenge the status quo and push back without it impacting my brand or my career

237
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,460
trajectory. Now think about those four levels. And think about psych safety at the team level.

238
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,860
If I am experiencing two of those four levels of psych safety, there's a higher probability

239
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,019
that I will innovate and collaborate.

240
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,960
Very differently, because I am experiencing those levels of psych safety. If I don't have

241
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,399
any of them, and I feel like I'm only there to do a job, and I don't have psych safety at any level,

242
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,740
do you realize I don't feel like I belong there? And I will disconnect and disengage

243
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:46,080
on purpose. So we talk about how psych safety is the underpinning for belonging and inclusive

244
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,539
cultures. And I use the work in my leadership practice, like the highest performing and highest

245
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,100
functioning leadership practice. And I use the work in my leadership practice, like the highest

246
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:59,840
functioning teams have high levels of psych safety every day. And I'll give you an example.

247
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,440
I was doing a session and a person said, I believe I have inclusion safety. Like, I feel like I belong

248
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,799
here. I'm in an environment. It sort of feels right for me. I feel good. But I don't have

249
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,880
contributor safety. And I asked this to tell me more why. He says, because when I'm in a meeting,

250
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,220
people hire me to bring my knowledge into this organization. So I come into the organization.

251
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,079
I bring up an idea. I bring up an idea. I bring up an idea. I bring up an idea. I bring up an idea.

252
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,160
And somebody says, where did you come from before? You haven't been here long enough. So just

253
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,660
thanks for the idea. But Will, just hold on. He says, that was OK the first time. But when that

254
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:43,859
happened in succession over a three-month period, I started to talk less. I started to offer less

255
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:50,220
to the point where I just did my job day to day. Love my job. Love the work. But I stopped

256
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,980
contributing because I didn't have the energy to do it. I didn't have the ability to do it. I didn't

257
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,559
have the psych safety that people wanted to hear my voice. In that same session, Luke, there was

258
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,059
somebody said, oh, I'm not worried about the contributor safety because I will always get

259
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:09,079
my voice heard because I am. I come to the table as a challenger. They hired me to just blow things

260
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:15,299
up. I'm a change person. So like, okay, but you know what I don't have and I wish I had? I wish

261
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:21,660
I had inclusion safety. I wish I felt like I fit in here, but I don't feel that. And I don't know

262
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:28,339
if I need to, but you're making me think, Reggie, maybe I need to pay attention to that because I

263
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:34,319
don't do a lot of efforts to get to know or understand people. I just deliver high results.

264
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:39,799
And he goes, huh, I've never thought about psych safety as a pathway to higher performance.

265
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,799
Never thought about it that way. That's so interesting. It's so interesting.

266
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,720
And Reggie, the reality is because most people in organizations have got to have a focus on

267
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,640
productivity, don't you? It has to come back.

268
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,619
You want to do things that make your organization, whatever you're in, sporting organization,

269
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:02,859
Google, whatever, it has to come back to being more effective. And when that's the top of the

270
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:07,640
tree, how we get there is fascinating. I want to talk on one of those pillars for a moment,

271
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,799
the inclusion safety, which clearly you're an expert in and you understand this space as well

272
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:21,599
as anyone else. I mean, I asked this as a nearly 49-year-old white male. So I understand,

273
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,920
my lived experience, but I feel nervous in this world now, Reggie, where I don't feel like I

274
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,839
discriminate or have any intention of discriminating against anyone, but it feels

275
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:37,920
nerve wracking now where you miss a nuance or you say something that you never intended to,

276
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,720
and the chance of being canceled or labeled something horrific is alive and well. Is that

277
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,880
a fair thing to be concerned about? Is that something you've got a thought on?

278
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,259
Yeah. And part of,

279
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,819
the solution for something like that is people owning the origins of their fear.

280
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,380
Because when I do sessions and when I coach people, I ask them, what is it that you're afraid of?

281
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,099
Like, why are you not engaging? And they will say some of the things you just said, look,

282
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,960
like I'm afraid I'm going to say the wrong thing, or I'm afraid I'm going to be misunderstood by

283
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,140
what I say. Where did the fear come from? Like, why is that fear troubling to you? Because there

284
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,559
is, there's an entire movement in the world today for people who are marginalized,

285
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,400
or underrepresented groups that suggest this to all dominant culture people. It's like,

286
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,480
I would rather you try and say something and show evidence of effort than say nothing at all,

287
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,640
because your fear is driving your disengagement. And I push people all the time. It's like,

288
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm going to be honest, I'd rather see you try, Luke, than sit there and stare at me.

289
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,240
Yeah.

290
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,480
Like, you don't know what to do when I need help. Like, you don't know what to do if something's

291
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
going on with my community and you, and all I'm looking for,

292
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:58,920
is the receipt, the evidence of effort that you at least are trying. Everybody will cut people's

293
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:06,900
slack for that. It's when people don't try and then make the excuse, I'm feeling whatever

294
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,519
dimension of humanity you want to put in there. And that's why I didn't say anything. That's why

295
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:18,339
I didn't show up for you. That's not how to make a better humanity at this particular point,

296
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,799
is by being an observer.

297
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,079
Yeah.

298
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,019
You need to be a participant in my life. That's what people want. Be a participant.

299
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,960
So what you're saying, have the courage and have a go, is what you're saying exactly. And I think

300
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,359
you're right. It is, there is this sort of, you know, when you're in the broadcast media or you

301
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:42,220
are expressing yourself in a way, I think it does come with this level of, I'd hate to say something

302
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,440
I regret. I've got no intention of doing that, but I think your message is a good one, isn't it?

303
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,220
If you show care, you're allowed to make a mistake because I'm just coming from the,

304
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,380
from the right place. And Reggie, your background fascinates me. You've got a master's in education,

305
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,319
but a double major in theater and music. And I understand you really use that, that sort of

306
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,640
double parts of your brain really passionately to learn in an experiential way so that people

307
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,000
can genuinely, rather than just academically understand something, you like people to

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,140
experience it for themselves. Can you share a bit of how you go about that?

309
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:19,759
Yeah. So part of the formula that I use is I believe in the metaphorical alignment,

310
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:30,160
which leads us to learning through an experience. Luke, I would probably not even hesitate to say

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,759
that most of how you became who you are was by living out your passion and your dream and doing

312
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,039
it with somebody. You didn't become who you are by yourself. I mean, you played a team sport.

313
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,400
So it's the shared experience that drives us to change our behaviors and to think differently.

314
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:49,480
So if I,

315
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,319
I was doing some work here in the US and this was, you know, a few years back though,

316
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,880
with the NBA, the National Basketball Association. And one of the things they were talking about is

317
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,079
the culture in a locker room and how they make decisions based on the hierarchy of players

318
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,240
in the locker room. And that the coach is really sort of parallel to all of that,

319
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,700
even though the coach has given the strategy. So if you start to pull that thread all the way

320
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,200
through and you start to think about experiences that people have, you're going to be able to

321
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,500
start to think about that. And I think that's one of the things that people have. What I use is I try to

322
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,440
mine an experience that is proximate to someone to help them understand that they are a part of the

323
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,460
solution for moving forward. Think about it this way. I could talk to you all day about the

324
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,720
importance of being together and connecting with another human. It's very different for me to talk

325
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,680
to you about it than have you in an experience with me where I, Luke, through literally the

326
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,980
objective of,

327
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:58,460
a particular module, is to create outsider-ness for you. So I treat you as if you don't belong.

328
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:05,599
Now, this isn't negative or heart wrenching. It's literally an experience. So I treat you just a

329
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,220
little bit differently than you expect. You are in the presence of somebody else. So what happens?

330
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,559
Your ego pops up. All of these things that make you want to behave differently. And it's in the

331
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,220
presence of other people. What is so amazing about music and theater?

332
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:20,200
What makes

333
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,759
music work is it creates an emotion that is universal. What makes theater work? Think about

334
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:33,039
it. It is a representation of the lives we live, yet on the stage, and we watch it and we connect

335
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,420
with it. I take that same formula and go, let's talk about being a better human. Whether this is

336
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,559
a leadership lens or the diversity, equity, and inclusion lens, let's have an experience together

337
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,200
so you don't just know something, you understand something, and you feel something.

338
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,579
That is a trilogy of what I do. I want you to move from knowing about it

339
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:04,440
to understanding it. And it's beautiful. Once you understand, then you can actually feel something.

340
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,900
We've stopped feeling, Luke. I need us to feel again about each other.

341
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,400
And I understand they're very profound experiences, the sessions that you run,

342
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,579
because exactly that, you get to feel it, you get to understand what it means and what it's like.

343
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,119
You know, I'm glad we're talking to you.

344
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,200
You know what I'm saying? I'm glad we're talking to you. I'm glad you're talking to me. I'm glad you're talking to me.

345
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,660
talking about experiences, Luke. One of the things that I'm so proud of that I've been able to

346
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,079
release in the last few years, it's the two-day experience, how it started off. It's called

347
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:35,420
Examined Human. And it's a leadership program talking about putting people through a set of

348
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,839
experiences to help them explore what it looks like to be a better human and actually live a

349
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,799
set of behaviors. And those behaviors are show up, be courageous, create visibility, and amplify

350
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:54,039
voices. And I think of what people can do to be better humans. It's a behavioral output that

351
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,140
people are looking for. Not more talking, not more thinking, but a set of behaviors. So Examined Human,

352
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,559
I hope to bring it to Australia. I have someone who's very interested. And one of the people that

353
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,359
I've been collaborating with and has become a really dear friend now is David Bartlett. He's

354
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:16,799
with the LOTE agency, and he's been to the Examined Human experiences, and he's really interested in

355
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,779
bringing it to Australia.

356
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,720
Because he says, we can make a difference here with people going through an experience like this.

357
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,880
So I'm really looking forward to meeting you and seeing David in Australia.

358
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:32,339
He's a great guy, Dave. He's pretty determined to bring that experience out here. So

359
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:39,640
hopefully we can be part of it. Reggie, it's a unique time, it seems, in 2024 on a global level

360
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,380
around leadership. And you live in a country at the moment that seems more divided maybe than it's

361
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,779
ever been before. And the politics,

362
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,099
are extreme in the United States at the moment. What's an example of a great leader? Is there one

363
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:00,160
out there you can share, Reggie, that you see? And so that's someone we need to see more of in your

364
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,180
world. Yeah, so I think what it is, so if I look at the positions inside organizations, and I'm not

365
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:12,099
going to point to one leader more than I'm going to point to a prototype of people who are doing

366
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,779
the work. When things are being attacked, either through policy, legislation, systems, whatever it

367
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,740
is, there are people inside organizations that will say, while that may be happening, it is also,

368
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:30,839
and if it's a distraction to my business and my people, I will then push back. And I got a lot of

369
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,500
prototypes of leaders who are, you know, having the good fight by standing up for their people

370
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:43,900
first. I tell people every day in this, in a society that has allowed being disruptive to

371
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,579
another group of people, that has allowed that to become

372
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:54,420
normative. And in some circles, even pushed as, yes, let's do that. There has to be people who

373
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,299
stand up and go, I don't have to agree with the policy. I don't even have to agree with how you're

374
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:07,359
doing something. But what I will stand for is stand up for my people. Look, let me give you an example

375
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,119
of something that's been happening. And when I talk about prototypes of leaders,

376
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,680
there was a situation in an organization where they were literally looking at

377
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,319
downsized,

378
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,220
downsizing, right-sizing, whatever word resonates with people. But they had told this particular

379
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,740
leader, let's sit in a room and let's talk about the people that we're going to need to let go.

380
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,579
And the person listened, this particular person I was coaching said, Reggie, I listened to my leader

381
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:41,539
put their list of all the people that we should let go of. And I sort of stopped them and went,

382
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,779
that's not the right solution. That impacts our people, which then hurts our brand. And he goes,

383
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:54,420
I don't want to do that. Can we look at an alternate solution versus the first thing we go to

384
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,920
is letting go of our people? And he said, his leader pushed back and he says, but this is what

385
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,819
we need to do. It's what's going to look right in the region. It's what's going to look right

386
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:10,420
in the market. And the person who was coaching went, that is not a reason to let go of people.

387
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,099
Because in this point, you're not thinking of the people, you're thinking of the business.

388
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,099
And so,

389
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:24,700
Luke, what I want to share is that is an example of somebody who is showing up on behalf of

390
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,980
creating better conditions for the people and using that as a human-centered approach.

391
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:36,359
I've got a session that I do, it's called Evolved Leadership, and that the tenets of it are,

392
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:42,180
it comes in three pillars. One of them is to be human first. The other one is to be compassionate.

393
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,740
The third is to be service-driven. That is what is expected of leaders today.

394
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:53,740
And that's what that particular leader modeled. He was human first. He was compassionate about how

395
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,079
it was going to impact their people. And he was service-driven. Any leader that I'm around,

396
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,579
I'm sure you've been around, if they were in service of you and what happened to you,

397
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,299
your loyalty is higher, your engagement is higher. You will take one for the team

398
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:14,960
because the person is indexed and in service of making things better for their people.

399
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,460
The business will still make it.

400
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,500
You know that, I know that. Teams don't die, people retire. Team's still there.

401
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:31,279
Hey Reggie, I love the message because we really are seeing a shift in that and what

402
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,359
great leaders look like is exactly your language, isn't it? Your podcast is care more and be a

403
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,299
better human and great leaders now have got a lot more empathy. We're seeing that in the sporting

404
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:47,579
sphere really strongly that the coaching world has got a lot more empathy and care and people-centric

405
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:47,759
first.

406
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:54,140
And service-driven away from that hierarchy that the era that I grew up in where the coach was the

407
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,160
boss and you got yelled at and abused. And if you could stand personal abuse, you sort of got

408
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,140
through, but none of us thought that was a healthy way to go about it. And so it's profound to share

409
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,420
these stories because we know there's a long way to go for, but the beauty of it is that, you know,

410
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,039
you're at the center of it. You're seeing the most effective teams are using these traits that

411
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,039
you're talking about, aren't they?

412
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,779
Hey Reggie, you've spoken a lot today about the loneliness epidemic and people's lack of human

413
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:29,400
connection and your passion to try and recreate those tentacles. I read a stat in the US that

414
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,019
on average, most people haven't got one friend they could call that they could truly confide in.

415
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,619
It's a sad, sad state of affairs. Why are you sounding the alarm on this so clearly? What's

416
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:46,940
the big message for you? So there's a couple of things. One is,

417
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,680
we are in a divided time right now. And I try to get people to understand we're in the midst of a

418
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,539
poly crisis. So you should look globally. There's wars around the globe. There's, you know, economic

419
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:06,259
downturn. There's, you know, the racial and social justice reckoning. All these things are happening.

420
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,559
The thing is, it's not that they've never happened before. They never happened in this close of a

421
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,019
succession. And they're right behind one another. And for us to make it through this season, we're

422
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,420
in a time right now, we have to make stronger human connections than we do, than we do about

423
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,920
being better about solving one of the issues. We keep trying to solve one of them and it keeps

424
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,220
stacking up against yet another crisis. And then it stacks up against another crisis. And all people

425
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:39,140
really want in the middle of this poly crisis is for you and me to know that we can count on one

426
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,940
another. That's what's sounding the alarm for me. I remember here in the US, the Surgeon General,

427
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,119
there's a Surgeon General advisory that says loneliness is at epidemic levels.

428
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,279
Now think about that. Loneliness, talk about a health-related issue that we should all pay

429
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:07,279
attention to. People are lonely and some people are choosing it because of what society has allowed

430
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,380
to become a normative set of choices. And so that's what makes it, I'm so passionate about

431
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,019
the follow-through to improve the human condition. I'm so passionate about the follow-through to

432
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:22,980
improve the human condition. And it may feel like it's a daunting task, but every time a crisis

433
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,619
has happened around the world, it is the human connection that made us get through it. You know

434
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:33,319
that. I know that. But people who are in the middle of the crisis don't get to pay attention

435
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:38,579
to that because they're in the middle of the crisis. You know, I'm going to try something

436
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:45,599
with you, Luke. Do you mind? I'd love to. I think people don't pay enough attention to people

437
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:52,059
beyond just the transactions of getting things done. If I'm your boss, your leader, family

438
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,579
member, if there's something we need to get done together, you were talking about parenting,

439
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,980
people will talk to you and it's about parenting and the transaction of getting things done and

440
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:06,140
solving problems. I am suggesting that you need, everybody needs to do a better job of

441
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,820
understanding the humans you interact with versus just knowing what they are going through.

442
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,440
And here's my example. There's a thing called the five life domains. The five life domains are

443
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,039
work, family, health, spirituality, and community. Now, I didn't make this up. These have always

444
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:27,500
been around. Work, family, health, spirituality, and community. I am suggesting that people start

445
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,239
to pay attention to how people prioritize those five things. And they don't always have to stay

446
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,179
the same. Think about that. Work, family, health, spirituality, community. Let's talk about poly

447
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:43,059
crisis. So I'm going to sort of connect this together. If of those five things, we're juggling

448
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,579
them all at the same time. If you're human and you're living, you're not going to be able to

449
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,400
and you're interacting in a human state, you are juggling those five things. If one of them is in a

450
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,000
disruptive or chaotic state, the other four still get attention and you pretty much can deal with it

451
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,119
because you pay attention to the one thing, you give it your energy. If two of them are in a

452
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,159
chaotic or disruptive state at the same time, the three that are left over, one of them,

453
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,360
they don't get the same amount of energy toward trying to juggle it or navigate it.

454
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,579
Now, imagine this. If you're living and you're interacting in a human state, you're juggling those

455
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,579
three of them are impacted in a disruptive state at the same time. That means the two that are

456
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:29,599
remaining get no attention. If I am in a relationship with somebody and my prioritization

457
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:38,239
is family first, health second, work third, community, and then spirituality, if that's my

458
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:44,719
prioritization and I am working with someone and their prioritization is not the same,

459
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,460
you realize,

460
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,039
we're going to miss each other and potentially be harmful without even knowing it.

461
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:57,260
Now, I'm going to ask you to do me a favor. Prioritize those one to five. You got people

462
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,119
listening to you. How do you prioritize these now in your life? Remember, work, family, health,

463
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,039
spirituality, community. One would be the one where you spend your most intellectual time

464
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,679
thinking about it and or emotional time feeling it. And five being, it's important, but I don't

465
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,539
tend to get to it.

466
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,860
Put them in order.

467
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,219
I'd start with family. That's the one I think about the most. How do we keep our family healthy

468
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:29,340
and safe? And then health comes second because I feel like if I don't pay attention to that,

469
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,920
then you can't serve your family and you can't serve your work. So that's definitely a clear

470
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,099
number two. Work would be third. I think as the priority list goes, you want to support your

471
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,579
family and you want to try and make sure that you can provide what you need. So I think that's

472
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,019
well. Community would be fourth for me, thinking about the communities I'm in and how you connect

473
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:57,420
well and I really value those communities. And spirituality would be fifth. I think there's a

474
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,940
gap there for me on that for sure. Something I think about, but that would be the order for me.

475
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,980
Okay. So Luke, I want you to sort of take this on and have your listeners just sort of

476
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,400
do this prioritization exercise in their own mind. The question is that order that

477
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,440
you just said, what's the order that you just said? What's the order that you just said?

478
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,579
What's the order that you just said? What's the order that you just said? What's the order that

479
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,840
you just put it in? There's two parts to this question. The first part is, has it always been

480
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,320
that way? No. No, it's changed as life evolved. Yeah, absolutely.

481
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay. So think about that. And if I am interacting with you and I don't know or even notice when the

482
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,619
prioritization changed, I am still interacting with you toward a priority that's misaligned.

483
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:45,579
So if at some point work was first and that's how I met you,

484
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,179
and work was important, then something happened in your family or with your health that changed

485
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:55,079
your priority, and I don't know you enough to understand that, you realize I will continue

486
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,320
to talk to you about work to the point where it becomes unhealthy. I'm always trying to get you

487
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,519
to do better, to perform better. We have to hit these numbers, do these goals, make this thing

488
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:12,679
happen. And you've transitioned over into family is what matters now. Health is what matters now.

489
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,400
I am telling people, you have to move beyond that. You have to move beyond that. You have to move

490
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,980
beyond knowing a person to understanding their prioritization. But this is our earlier point.

491
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:26,000
If a person doesn't feel, have psychological safety with you, I will never share my prioritization.

492
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,260
That's why psych safety is so important. You've got to have that. So I then will want to share

493
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,159
that with you. Now I'm going to ask you another question. And it's, is that the order you want

494
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:45,340
it to be in moving forward? Another great question, Reggie. And I think probably, as I said,

495
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm turning 49 in July and I feel like getting to that mid part of your life, I think I've got

496
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,280
the order better than I ever have done before. And I obviously didn't know you're going to ask

497
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,960
that question, but yeah, I think the family one is, you know, maybe it wasn't early. You were

498
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,820
sort of fighting in your own world and your own sense of achievement. And then you realize,

499
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,760
well, I certainly have that. That's the thing that makes me happiest and most connected and

500
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,599
the health priority, you know, playing sport for a living.

501
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah.

502
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,739
And I, and I let it go for a while because you know, you get busy in work, but then you realize

503
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:26,579
without some daily attention to that, your life is, is, is going to fall away. So yeah, I feel

504
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,940
like I've got it in pretty good shape. Yeah. Yeah. And that, that is, that is like a dialed

505
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,840
in answer because you've been through something and you know that that's what the answer is.

506
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,440
Do you realize how many people are in the world right now? If loneliness is an epidemic,

507
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,260
that's not sharing that with anybody. And even more important,

508
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,579
they haven't done the exercise for themselves. So they haven't paid attention to it. I, you know,

509
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:58,239
you're using your chronological age as, as the rational reason for why you're thinking that way.

510
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,460
And that is totally valid. There are people listening that aren't your chronological age

511
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,079
and their priorities are very different. What I'm saying to make a stronger human connection,

512
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,260
you should want to know what a person's priorities are. So you can be supportive of the priority,

513
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,500
you're still going to get other things done, but we're not, we're transactional at best.

514
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:28,599
I believe this, and I don't want any listeners to hear this out of context, but we, most of us,

515
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,960
are selfish first. Like when we wake up, we have a list of things to do, whether written down or

516
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,940
in our head of things we need to do to make our day better, of things we need to do to get things

517
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,139
done through other people.

518
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,260
And we start with us, and then somewhere in the middle of the day, if something dramatic or

519
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:56,699
traumatic happens, we'll pay attention to somebody else's thing that they need. But most of us are

520
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:02,659
selfish first. When I am talking about what I need leaders and companies to start to figure out how

521
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:09,739
to do, is how can you wake up and be centered on what other people need as a part of your daily

522
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:14,659
routine? Still do what you need to do for you, but in parallel,

523
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,139
can you think about who am I going to help today, or this week, or next week? How can I be supportive

524
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:27,360
of somebody today, or this week, or next week? I didn't say don't pay attention to your own list

525
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,420
and your own priorities, but we need to start to add other humans to our planning phase of our

526
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:41,780
days, our weeks, our months. And you'll see a very slight shift toward people are caring about one

527
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,380
another in a different way now, because you did it on purpose. You did it on purpose. You did it on

528
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,679
purpose. It was intentional. You woke up. I got a leader who said this to me, says, Reggie, you know

529
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,940
what I wake up and I do on Mondays now? I ask people on my team, what do you need from me this

530
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:03,300
week? I don't ask them about their weekend. Their weekend's for them. Why would I encroach on that

531
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,780
narrative? I ask them, hey, let's get started. What do you need from me this week? And people get to

532
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,460
tell me what they need. Will they still talk about their weekends? Maybe, maybe not. I don't need to

533
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,380
use that as the end goal. I don't need to use that as the end goal. I don't need to use that as the end goal.

534
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,719
I don't need to use that as the entryway to get to know somebody. So I say, what do you need from

535
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,400
me this week? You know what happened, Reggie? People started telling me, hey, I've got a doctor's

536
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,159
appointment with my son on Thursday. There's a really big meeting I was supposed to be a part of.

537
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,480
I'd like to see if there's a way I can have somebody take my place.

538
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,400
They would have never asked that question. If the leader hadn't led with, how can I help you this

539
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,380
week? Think about that. I said, somebody else on my team went, son's daughter,

540
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,000
got a special celebration happening at their school. I have never been to one of them. I would

541
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,960
love to go. It happens to be tomorrow. And I didn't put in time off. I didn't tell anybody,

542
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,659
but you were asking me how I can be helpful. That would be helpful. Now, both of those

543
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:07,500
seemed personal. Remember, work, family, health, spirituality, community. Those were both family

544
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,320
related. Somebody else in this person's team said, you know what? I need you to extend a deadline

545
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,380
because I'm not going to make it by Wednesday. I'm not going to make it by Wednesday. I'm not going to

546
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,519
make it by Wednesday. And I'm telling, I'd rather tell you, ask me what can be helpful. Can you

547
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,699
move some things out of my way and help me prioritize so I can either meet the deadline

548
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:29,679
or can you extend the deadline? Again, that person's prioritization was work.

549
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,920
But that leader would have gotten none of those answers had he not repositioned his framing for

550
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,599
interacting with his team when something is simple, as simple for something as simple as

551
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,199
Monday morning catch up.

552
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:46,099
It's so different.

553
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,980
And it's brilliant, Reggie, in its simplicity. And I love the way you ask that question and

554
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,119
explain it. And you're right. We start with our things to do list and I do that, start the day,

555
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:01,460
but there is time to connect to someone else, isn't it? Find out where they're at and with

556
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,000
their health and their priority list. And so it's a profound bit of wisdom that you've shared today,

557
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,739
Reggie, and I really appreciate it. We use the term here, Reggie, a lot in this podcast,

558
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:14,079
success.

559
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:18,900
This leaves clues and you've shared some great wisdom today. And there's a series of what we

560
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,539
think great leadership looks like. And I'd love to ask you a range of these and please expand as

561
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:29,599
much as you like or as little as you like. But I'm curious very much from your self-reflective

562
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,519
stance to understand. And we start with this idea of self-leadership, Reggie. We feel like it's hard

563
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,840
to lead someone else unless you understand your own sense of self-leadership. What does that mean

564
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,280
to you?

565
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,400
So I believe that there is a

566
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,099
a

567
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:54,260
there is a version that people have and it's the self-deception of leadership. So some people

568
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:00,159
think they're a leader and don't know that they are not because they haven't done the work of

569
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,780
allowing people to give them good feedback. And so they're deceiving themselves. When I look at

570
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,900
self-leaders, self-leadership, those people are doing an assessment multiple times throughout

571
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,079
their, their,

572
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:19,380
year and multiple times throughout their career to see if the version they think they are delivering

573
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,400
as a leader is meeting the expectations of the people they are leading. So we, we sometimes live

574
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,360
in a world of self-deception because we like to think when we're putting these at least positional

575
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,579
leadership roles, we like to think that we're doing it. But if you never create enough

576
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,699
safety for people to tell you, actually, that's not working, you'll never know.

577
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,159
So that's one thing about self-leaders. The only other thing about self-leadership is that I want,

578
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,159
I want people to also always remember and listen, how you led at one point in your life may look very

579
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,820
different than how you lead now and or how you will lead in the future. So we should always be

580
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:02,539
looking for a way to evolve and adapt and or assess what we need to do to change, but it's in

581
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:08,559
service of being a better leader, not staying the leader you are. That's just another way I have

582
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,400
people frame it. Brilliant. And I love that thought of self-deception, isn't it? We can live in that

583
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,860
space.

584
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,940
And not asking people to give us genuine feedback around the impact that we're having. How do we

585
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,940
know? And I think that term's fascinating to me, that self-deception, isn't it? We've got a title,

586
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,880
looks like I'm succeeding, but I haven't really taken the time to find out. It's brilliant. We

587
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,139
see leaders are really conscious, Reggie, around the positive impact they have on others in their

588
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:41,139
environment. And you just described the beautiful way with the five values, work, family, health,

589
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,599
spirituality, and community of checking in on

590
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,880
having an impact on people. It's a profound thing that you said. How else do you go about

591
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,980
day-to-day, Reggie, having an impact on people that in proximity to you is the language you use?

592
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:02,199
Yeah. So one of the things that I will offer everybody to find the technique that works for

593
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,659
them that is closest to what they already do. So I already meet my team in the morning. I already

594
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:11,860
talk to them. If I use the example of asking people what they need and I make that a habit,

595
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,239
then it becomes normative.

596
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,579
In my space with the people that I'm around most of the time. The other thing I'm going to ask

597
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:22,559
people to do is I need you to start to do something you're not used to doing to create a

598
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,860
stronger habit. And here's what I mean by that. If I already meet with my team and I've already

599
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,940
started asking, how can I help you this week? What do you need from me? I also may need to ask

600
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:39,000
something different because once I've created sex edu with that, there's nothing stopping me from

601
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,579
going, how can I help you? And what do I need to do? And I'm going to ask people what they need to

602
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,539
know about you that I could be more helpful. So look at the nuance of the words. How can I help

603
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:56,400
you this week? It's pretty universal. Anybody can say whatever they want to say. If I am looking at

604
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,360
a very specific person, not the team, and I go, is there anything I need to know that would make

605
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,619
me more helpful to you? It gives that person an opportunity to tell me something very specific

606
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:11,260
that is directly related to them versus in a team environment. That's just, it's called, so

607
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,480
there's a book called Atomic.

608
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,739
Habits. And I use a lot of that framing. It's called habit stacking. So I've already have a

609
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:23,739
habit. I just stack another habit on top of it. And I use that when I coach people. I use that

610
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:29,239
when I talk to leaders all the time. You already leading, start to add stronger habits and make

611
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,780
sure one of those habits is about making a stronger human connection. We have to be intentional about

612
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,920
the human connection, not accidental. And I hope everybody hears that loud and clear. We are

613
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,579
accidentally kind most of the time. We accidentally,

614
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,360
make connections most of the time, which is why we're so amazed when somebody has a connection.

615
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:54,920
You go, really? You went to that school? Oh, like that's an accidental connection. I want us to make

616
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,920
the connection on purpose by looking for it, not waiting for it to sit in front of you. So this

617
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,920
whole thing about habit stacking is the, is the other sort of, not, it's more than just a habit.

618
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,519
It's intentionality. And I, again, I want people to sort of hear that. Be very intentional about

619
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:13,440
the human connection.

620
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,980
And Reggie, I love it. You know, the intentionality is right in the wheelhouse of

621
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,960
the work we do in a leader and in our space, which is connecting these bespoke groups of people that

622
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,420
wouldn't have connected and, and, and might come from really unique, different backgrounds. And it

623
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:34,739
takes some courage to show up on a screen and say, I'm sitting across from Reggie Butler. He's had

624
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:40,119
this huge success in his work, but can I share and can I learn? And, and so I love the way you

625
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,559
think about that in a profound way. Performance paradigms,

626
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,099
you've got a really clear vision and you talk about human connection so passionately and

627
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,820
the way you deliver it is, is intriguing to me. How do you go about sharing that vision

628
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,900
with your team and, and making sure that it resonates?

629
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,460
When I think about the work we do, and if we're going to improve the human condition as,

630
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:06,400
as our mission, I make sure that the people on my team had the ability to improve their lives

631
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,980
based on the work we do. So we live the work. We are the work. I have a colleague that's a coach

632
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:20,980
and is a phenomenal woman. And she said, being is the new doing. Like we, we do work.

633
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,159
We are the work. Like I am the change I talk about. I am the human connection that I talk

634
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,159
about. And I, and I offer that to everybody that, that works with me. Like, what do you need to

635
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:39,960
actually be that human connector? What do you need? And I allow people to, to practice in that

636
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,960
space. I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, say this to you too, Luke.

637
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,219
I don't want people to search for something that they think is unreachable. It's not attainable.

638
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,960
We are not practiced as a species on making a human connection first.

639
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:02,320
We're practiced as a species to stay apart. So if you think about civilization, you think about,

640
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:08,679
you know, a tribe, a community, when they are on their land, in their space, in their place,

641
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:13,039
and you look over the horizon and another group of people are coming towards you,

642
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,420
you're going to say, well, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

643
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,579
And so our first instinct isn't to go to them with open arms. Our first instinct is to make sure we do a quick

644
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:24,920
assessment, whether or not there will be harm involved. And then as they get closer, there's

645
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,719
all these social clues and cues. We decide that we should connect, but our first instinct

646
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:37,679
is to stay apart. So think about that and let that from the birth of civilization and then take that

647
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,739
all the way up to now. Do you realize when we start working for a company, when we go someplace,

648
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,719
we're like, oh, we're going to be working for a company. We're going to be working for a company.

649
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,440
And so our second instinct is to stay separate from people until we figure things out, to stay apart

650
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,599
from people until we know what the rules are in this organization, to know how to act, how to be

651
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,840
in this space. We're not practiced in being connected first. Now there's neuroscience behind

652
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:06,539
that. And I'll prove it to you in a really quick thing. So when you are interacting with somebody,

653
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:13,480
there's chemicals. We have a chemical reaction with each other. And I believe that the,

654
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:19,719
you know, we all know what oxytocin is. We also know what dopamine is. We also know what

655
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:25,159
adrenaline is. So when you're interacting with somebody on your team and somebody sends you an

656
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:31,940
email that says, hey, I need to talk. You tell me, Luke, if you get an email from somebody that

657
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:37,420
you work with and they say, hey, we need to talk one sentence, which chemical do you think is being

658
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:43,059
released for most people? I think the fear kicks in for most people.

659
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,880
Is my instinct. It's like, what have I done wrong? Not, not, hey, this could be a great

660
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,559
opportunity. I might be in trouble, you know, that's, you know, and I do that myself too,

661
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,159
isn't it? You get a call from, from, you know, a leader in an organization. Hey,

662
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,559
can we meet on Thursday? And that's it. And you go, hey, shit, you know, have I missed something

663
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,519
here? Have I, and it might be, it's a catch up until you're doing a great job, but that's not

664
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:13,579
your first instinct, is it? We're not practiced in, in letting oxytocin and serotonin,

665
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,300
and those chemicals be a part of our human connection. We immediately jump to cortisol

666
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,900
and adrenaline is just flushing through our system. Like what happened? Oh my goodness.

667
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,179
What do I need to do that? Did I turn in something late? Did I not do something? Is my wife,

668
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:31,820
is my partner? Like anytime anybody reaches out to us, we should be going, oh, I can't wait to

669
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:38,340
talk to him. But that's not the normal response. And you know it. And everybody listening knows

670
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,940
that. I want you to think about which chemical, this is about the neuroscience of it all,

671
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,239
what chemical do you make course through another person's body when you talk to them? Anybody who's

672
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,420
listening to me right now, think about the person you love. When you talk to them, what chemical

673
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:59,000
are you making release when they interact with you? Is it cortisol? Is it dopamine? Is it

674
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,659
adrenaline? You got to think about these things because it's really important that we pay attention

675
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:08,260
to that. Now I'm making what feels like it's a little light of it, Luke. It's so serious though.

676
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,500
There's, there's a, a serious lens that I want,

677
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:19,599
people to understand. We, when we interact with another human, we change their biology

678
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,440
and I'm dead serious. We change people's biology and I want us to be responsible

679
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,219
when we interact with people. Some of the offhanded comments we make to some people,

680
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:37,420
it changes their biology. If fear is an emotion, they start to exhibit everything that comes,

681
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,659
trickles along with fear, will make a person not want to connect. So we,

682
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,199
to pay attention to the clues and cues and look at neuroscience as the reason that what I'm talking

683
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,880
about is validated. We should pay attention to it. And we know that Reggie, don't we? That people

684
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:00,860
get sick in work environments that aren't healthy and it morphs into literally disease. As you said,

685
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,480
it changes biology. When you're in an unhealthy environment, you don't think you can escape. It

686
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,219
affects your family life. It affects your relationships. It's, it's, it's profound.

687
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,039
Reggie, I want to ask you, we see curiosity as a,

688
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,380
as a common word that is really something across leaders and they use curiosity to approach their

689
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:25,519
learning and development. Does that ring true to you? Yes. Um, so I started, I use that as one of

690
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:34,679
the fundamental core tenants of learning retention. Um, there was a, um, um, a guy named Jim Rohn. He's

691
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:40,639
passed away. And one of the things he said in one of his talks and teachings, he said that when the

692
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,360
brain is frustrated,

693
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:49,460
it shuts down. Learning can't get in. Learning doesn't stick. He also suggested through his

694
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:55,659
studies that when the brain is fascinated, analogous to being curious, we learn more and

695
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:01,199
we retain more. So I want you to think about that. There's a difference between being frustrated as

696
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,880
you go throughout your day in a state of confusion, trying to figure things out versus

697
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,179
curious or fascinated by the possibilities that will make you lean into learning. So curiosity

698
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:13,480
holds a very,

699
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,159
very high space in my work in terms of us getting to next. If people were more curious about race,

700
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:25,940
identity, culture, and heritage, uh, about how people move in the complexities of culture, we

701
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:31,980
would have much better outcomes, but we're not curious about it. We're mostly frustrated by

702
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,480
different opinions around race, identity, culture, and heritage to the point where I actually had to

703
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,960
create a product called rich dialogues, race, identity, culture, and heritage. Cause I believe

704
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,159
people don't talk enough.

705
00:56:43,480 --> 00:57:08,579
They don't dialogue nearly enough to move past the level of uncomfort, um, the level of discomfort in order to get to this, the complexities of what makes us all beautiful. We don't talk enough. We sit in our positions and we try to convince each other about why the way we're thinking is the way to think. That is not helpful. It's interesting, but it's not helpful all the time.

706
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:13,380
And Reggie, communicating with clarity is another dimension of leadership. We see you're an incredible

707
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:13,460
leader.

708
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:24,940
You're a communicator. You get your words across in a really, uh, unique way. Is that something you've, you've dialed into, or is that just you as, uh, as the way that you've been able to evolve?

709
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:43,119
So I will tell you, so I, I've leveraged my theater background, uh, in that context. I want you to think about this story. So I have, I have always, um, been in front of an audience. So theater and music taught middle school, taught high school, adjunct professor.

710
00:57:43,119 --> 00:58:06,980
So that means I've always stood in front of somebody delivering knowledge towards somebody. I'm a classically trained pianist. I eventually had a band, uh, played in front of crowds. So it's always been me working the craft and science of making a connection through verbal acuity and creating an emotional experience for people.

711
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:13,000
So I've crafted that my entire life, not knowing that would take me to this space in this moment.

712
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:31,059
But I've always been in front of people, always passionate about delivering a message. And to anybody who's entering this space, and I'm not talking about DEI and leadership, anybody who is entering the space of delivering messages, you need to put in the work.

713
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:42,800
Being passionate isn't enough. I got a lot of people. It's like, Reggie, I'd love to do what you do. I'm so passionate about, and they give me whatever the topic is. This doesn't mean you should do it. You should practice first.

714
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:54,000
And then get in front of people and deliver that message. So you are confident that they will be confident after they hear your message. No, I've been doing this all my life, my friend.

715
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,699
And Reggie, how important has collaboration been for you in the work that you do?

716
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:11,760
So I honestly believe this. People should never think they can do anything alone. I don't know where people sort of picked up the reasoning that suggests I can make it by myself. It's always been about collaboration. There's always people.

717
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,760
Great minds.

718
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:34,159
Great minds occupy spaces all the time. You just have to tap into it. I believe there's a great mind in every room. In every room. I just need to give voice to that great mind, create space for that great mind to actually be heard. And I love to amplify the thoughts and framing and perspectives of other people everywhere I go.

719
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:42,500
There's a great mind in every room. I love that thought, isn't it? But a lot of them don't get heard because, as you said, the environment stopped there.

720
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:49,260
To allow people the ability to share their wisdom with you. Reggie, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

721
00:59:49,579 --> 01:00:12,960
I would go toward family. So I would say it's a combination of people, but my mom and dad. And the reason I use my mom and dad is because they both had two very different styles. And I was a product of multiple perspectives on how to survive and thrive. So I was raised military. I was never on the road. My father was already back from his travels.

722
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:38,739
When I met him. But he was the person that put structure and discipline in my life. And I learned from him. He also became the manager of the band I had. He traveled with me. So I got discipline and organization from him. And my mother was this beautiful spirit that was always in service of other people, no matter what they were dealing with, no matter what they were going through. She always showed grace and compassion.

723
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:43,099
And so I lived a life of seeing both of those and learned how to.

724
01:00:43,119 --> 01:01:02,039
Learned how to navigate both spaces at the same time. That's why, Luke, when we when we talk about some people say this human centered work is or are soft skills. I push back. The soft skills are absolutely the hard skills that people need to master.

725
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:12,460
I can master those other technical skills by learning more and practicing more for me to master the soft skills. I have to make connections with people.

726
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:41,440
And that that's why I say you have to do the work. So my the role models in my life, the leaders in my life were my mom and my dad first. And then as I go through different stages in my life, there was a professor at the university. There was a CEO at a company I worked for. So I've had different leaders at different times. Thank goodness, because what I learned was there's always a different type of leader based on situations and seasons in life.

727
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,960
Yeah.

728
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,059
Yeah.

729
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:42,099
Yeah.

730
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:42,159
Yeah.

731
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:42,440
Yeah.

732
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:42,460
Yeah.

733
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,159
that i met later in my life i would have never listened to earlier in my life so i'm glad that

734
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:53,039
i went through my first leaders first that seemed to be set up for me and i love when people go to

735
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,840
their family when you've had the the great uh good fortune isn't it to have that role modeling so

736
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,400
close to home it's a it's a it's a gift in life and i feel very much the same with that with my

737
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,619
parents and in we're obsessed with collaboration in in the work we do reggie and i wanted to ask

738
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:14,320
this question to finish on in the work that you do is there is there someone you would identify i

739
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,639
think god if i could collaborate with that person it would be a great in any of the passions in your

740
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:25,280
life um you've got so many of them is there a name that springs to mind in terms of collaboration

741
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,400
that you'd like to work with i don't know it's for different phases of my life that's hard to

742
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,559
answer because i would say if it was in the in the music world um one of my idols that sort of

743
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,400
shaped how i view music was prince and

744
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:42,719
everything that he delivered to the world and how he stood up for the rights of his music

745
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:49,159
i would love to be in collaboration with him not to do a song specifically but to be in a space with

746
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:55,780
somebody that multi-talented that delivered meaning purpose and messages through his music

747
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:00,280
love to collaborate with somebody like that i mean he's not with us anymore but i can take

748
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,380
any number of artists that are out there now and we'll love to have a collaborative session

749
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:08,360
about being a better human using music as the

750
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:08,599
you

751
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:15,239
pathway to creating stronger um connection that that was that on the music side um

752
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:21,599
there have been many many leaders that have been in space most of them are u.s based so of course

753
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:29,039
