1
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,239
Richard Guida grew up in the tiny sheep and crop farming town of Tamberlup, 290 kilometres

2
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,500
south-east of Perth, from remote country Western Australia.

3
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,600
Richard's life of leadership and success in corporate Australia is a remarkable story.

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,520
From 2005 to 2017, Richard was CEO and Managing Director of Wesfarmers, Australia's largest

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,380
private employer.

6
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,280
He's currently the Chairman of listed companies Qantas, Woodside Petroleum, Chairman of the

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,200
AFL, WA Symphony Orchestra, the Channel 7 Telethon Trust, the Juvenile Diabetes Research

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,700
Fund Australia, and former Chair of Australia's B20, a key business advisory to the World

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,340
Economic Forum, which includes business leaders from all G20 economies.

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,259
Richard, that's a lot on your plate.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,039
It's great to see you.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,939
Thanks for taking the time today.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,000
Great to be with you, Luke.

14
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,780
Appreciate you doing that.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,439
I look at your story of leadership and how you've been in some of the most high-profile

16
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,260
leadership roles in Australian public life.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,799
And from a small sheep farming town in country WA, can you share with us, what do you think

18
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,159
are the traits that have enabled you to be in those positions?

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,659
A bit of luck on the way, Luke.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
I actually think growing up in the country was a wonderful upbringing.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,819
Mum and Dad were the best farmers in the world, but I saw drought, I saw poor commodity prices,

22
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,939
I saw external factors impacting.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,060
And it built a bit of resilience, I think.

24
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,819
It built a bit of self-reliance.

25
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,219
And so I think that's helped on my journey.

26
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:54,120
It also actually gave me an ambition not to be a farmer, because I saw that life was challenging

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,939
for Mum and Dad.

28
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:02,760
So I've always been ambitious, still am ambitious, to do things to make change, hopefully for

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,200
the better.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,939
And I mentioned life.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,379
But I've had some luck along the way.

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:10,780
I was lucky.

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,080
I got a great education at boarding school in Perth.

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
I was lucky enough to be a Rotary Exchange student way back in 1978 in upstate New York,

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,400
and that was important for me in terms of looking at capitalist society, if you like,

36
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:25,960
in the US.

37
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:28,520
I had a great tertiary education.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,979
And when I left university, there were more jobs than there were graduates.

39
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,900
So I was able to have a lot of fun at uni.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,259
I met my wife at university.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:48,439
But I've always been driven, but hopefully with a sense of balance, but a pretty clear

42
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,520
idea of where I wanted to get to.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,199
So that sort of ambition, Richard, at a young age, as you said, great life experiences and

44
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,979
great education, but did you have that focus to get to these sort of roles?

45
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:05,180
I was silly enough when I was young to tell my friends that I wanted to be Prime Minister

46
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,259
one day, which they continually remind me of.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,319
Thank God for Australia, that never happened.

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,699
So yeah, I sort of always wanted to be in a position where I could be a decision maker.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,099
And I love that.

50
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,139
I love being in a position where you make decisions.

51
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,879
Now, the reality is you get some right, you get some wrong.

52
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,020
When you get them right, it's fantastic.

53
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,020
When you get them wrong, you get your head whacked.

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,939
But I sort of rather be that than sitting in the background.

55
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,819
Not being that decision maker.

56
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,879
Well, you become CEO of West Farmers 2005.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Speaking of making decisions, it's only two years into your term that you acquire Coles.

58
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,500
It's a $20 billion takeover.

59
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,199
And I think, Richard, correct me if I'm wrong, that's still the biggest corporate takeover

60
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,919
in Australian history.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,819
Is that still the case?

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,460
It was at the time.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,819
Probably not now, Luke.

64
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,240
But what was interesting about that from a leadership point of view is, you're right,

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,539
I took over in 2005.

66
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,419
In 2006, we had an opportunity to acquire a business.

67
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,159
And I sort of had this...

68
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:13,039
It's a bit of a naive view on leadership at the time, which was everyone in the team

69
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,719
will march together shoulder to shoulder.

70
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,839
And I sort of worked out through that period that actually leaders have to lead.

71
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:29,019
And I made a couple of bad calls during that potential acquisition in 2006 because I wasn't

72
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:29,779
prepared to lead.

73
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,879
I was hoping that everyone would be lockstep.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
And so I sort of learned in 2006 that actually as a leader, you have to lead.

75
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:47,339
So when the Coles opportunity came along in 2007, I sort of determined to myself that

76
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,199
I was going to lead this.

77
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,439
And I was going to...

78
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,639
I basically put everything else aside and got to work on it.

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,740
And that was, I think, significant in how we were able to navigate our way through,

80
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,879
which was a very complex time because the first waves of the global financial crisis

81
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,639
started coming through in 2007.

82
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,339
It was a big acquisition for West Farmers.

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,860
But what I'd sort of learned in the preceding years helped drive that outcome.

84
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,399
And it was an amazing year.

85
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,740
And following 10 years that I was CEO, it transformed West Farmers.

86
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,899
And Richard, it's interesting to hear you talk about having that chance in 2006, wanting

87
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,680
to get everyone to march with you and talking to a lot of different leaders from different

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,040
backgrounds.

89
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,860
We generally feel there's a shift.

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,879
There's a shift away from the old school hierarchical leadership into a more collaborative

91
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,500
approach.

92
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,759
We're sitting at the AFL house here this morning, and you look at the senior AFL coaches are

93
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,699
much more collaborative than the predecessors in the past.

94
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,860
But you just said really clearly then, leaders need to lead.

95
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,819
How do you see the change in leadership now?

96
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,540
Well, look, I think it's incredibly important when you're leading an organisation to have

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
really good people around you.

98
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,819
And it's a real challenge when you've been a peer of those people.

99
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,980
And then you're elevated to be the leader.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,079
And because your expectations and standards or mine certainly changed.

101
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,660
But so I think that's really important.

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,959
And having good, diverse voices, whether it's a board, whether it's a management team, is

103
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,319
important.

104
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,079
And more often than not, as a leader, I got great information and the decision was already

105
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,459
made.

106
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,199
But there are times when it's a hard decision.

107
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:41,000
Often with people, they're really hard decisions or it's a hard, you know, we're going to do

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,819
something and we're prepared to put ourselves out to make it.

109
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,319
And that's when I think leaders have to lead.

110
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,800
And I'll often say that to young people, you know, it's definitional in the word, leadership.

111
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,939
You have to lead.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,939
So I would not describe myself as autocratic, far from it.

113
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,779
You know, I'd certainly describe myself as a team player.

114
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,500
I think you're right about coaches.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,699
I think you're right about leaders.

116
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:07,120
Generally.

117
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,220
But I still think the best leaders in their own way lead.

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,279
And I look at Mandela.

119
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,860
I look at people like Gail Kelly, who I think was a phenomenal corporate leader in Australia.

120
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,600
I look at some of the political leaders who have made a big difference and can look back

121
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,720
on their term and say, we got things done.

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,139
And it's because they were prepared to be held accountable for making decisions that

123
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,379
they led on.

124
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
So you think the balance is there where you can...

125
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:37,939
You can still give everyone a voice.

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,019
You can still listen to people.

127
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,779
You can still be collaborative.

128
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,199
Yeah.

129
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,399
But ultimately, if a hard call comes, you need to own it as a leader.

130
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:44,980
Is that...?

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,139
Yeah.

132
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,459
Yeah.

133
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,860
And so I'll try and give a reasonably quick example.

134
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,579
During Coles, as I said, the first ripples of the global financial crisis started coming

135
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:53,879
through.

136
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,600
And that changed what we were planning to do.

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,120
We were planning to do a joint venture with private equity to acquire a number of the

138
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,600
businesses in the Coles group, including Coles and the...

139
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,040
Supermarket and Coles Liquor.

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:17,120
And then their ability to fund it fell away because of tightening of liquidity.

141
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,899
The private equity groups bought out?

142
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,160
Yeah.

143
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,819
So I went for a run, plod, in Perth.

144
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,420
And I came back and I asked one of our guys to run some numbers on what it would look

145
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,320
like if we're doing it on our own.

146
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,759
And unsurprisingly, the numbers were good.

147
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,019
Because the debt that Westfarmers could source was cheaper than the debt that private equity

148
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,279
partners could source.

149
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,700
And so I went to the board the next day and said, I think we should still do this.

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,019
And here's what the numbers look like.

151
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,000
And that was the brave call, if you like.

152
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,080
There were two brave calls.

153
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,139
One was to spend a couple of billion dollars buying equity in Coles and that early on.

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,779
And then going ahead on our own.

155
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,059
Because we could have pulled back at that stage.

156
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,980
But I'm glad we didn't.

157
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,259
So sometimes you've just got to make a call.

158
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,000
And when they work out like that, it's probably a career-defining moment in lots of ways.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
It goes the other way.

160
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,559
You're probably not sitting here in a lot of different roles, potentially, which is...

161
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,000
100%.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,620
My wife, Janine, said to me, because there was a lot of media on all this, and early

163
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,779
on there were lots of doubts.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,879
There's always doubters.

165
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,679
And you know that from where you are now on everything.

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,460
And she said to me one stage, why did you do this?

167
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,000
I said, well, you know...

168
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,779
People said you're putting Westfarmers at risk.

169
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,120
I was never going to put Westfarmers at risk.

170
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,620
I said, just put my job at risk for a period of time.

171
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:45,940
We could handle that.

172
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,299
I'm always interested in people who do great things over a sustained period of time.

173
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,259
What daily routines and hacks to get through?

174
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,759
I mean, you hear it's the AFL season launch.

175
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,240
There's so many balls in the air in your world.

176
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,519
What do you do day-to-day to keep you healthy and successful?

177
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,799
I'm an incredibly supportive life partner.

178
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:17,759
So, you know, Janine and I have been sort of great best friends almost since my first

179
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,820
year of university and married for, I don't know, we're coming up 40 years soon.

180
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,200
So that's been a great help for great kids.

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,480
And so I think I've been able to have an appropriate balance of focusing on family

182
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,019
and prioritising that at times.

183
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,200
I've tried to...

184
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,000
I've tried to remain reasonably fit because I don't think you're any good to anyone if

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,919
you're not and if you're not healthy.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
And I've had pretty good mentors.

187
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,100
I've had great mentors actually through my life who've from time to time corrected the

188
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,919
course I was on, you know, when I was too focused on one thing and not focused on another.

189
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,879
And a healthy...

190
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,059
I'm not bad.

191
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,220
I take my roles seriously.

192
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,340
I try not to take myself too seriously, Luke.

193
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,340
And so I...

194
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,720
Hopefully people would say when they talk about me that I'm not high ego.

195
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,000
I mean, I think if you want to be an ASX company CEO, you've got to have a degree of self-belief

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,320
and so that implies ego.

197
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,220
But hopefully people would say he's pretty balanced and he's relatively low ego.

198
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,059
And I actually...

199
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm not worried about what people say about me.

200
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,539
I worry a lot about what they say about the organisations I'm involved in and that probably.

201
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,340
sort of helps me a bit as well.

202
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,320
You mentioned some mentors along the way.

203
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,360
Can you share a few names and their impact?

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,100
Is that...

205
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,179
I work for a guy, Michael Chaney at West Pharmacy.

206
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,519
He's my predecessor's CEO.

207
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,519
And Michael's been a friend and mentor for a long period of time.

208
00:11:51,919 --> 00:12:00,980
You know, really good values and some guidance early on in my career about just making the

209
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,860
right call on ethics.

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,279
Because on integrity, it's not...

211
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,440
Luke, it's not black and white.

212
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:06,659
You know...

213
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,120
You know that.

214
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,600
And I always say now to people, if it's a shade of grey, fall on the right side.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,399
Don't...

216
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,700
And I think Michael was...

217
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,879
Gave me great direction on that.

218
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,259
I was very lucky through my time as CEO of West Pharmacy.

219
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,220
I had a mentor, a guy called Chris Bartlett, who was a Harvard School professor.

220
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,500
Chris grew up in Queensland.

221
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
He was a King's Cup rower.

222
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,679
He was a good rugby player.

223
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:35,759
He was at McKinsey and Alcoa, I think, and ended up as a professor at Harvard Business School.

224
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,539
And Chris and I would...

225
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,799
We'd speak either face-to-face or on the phone every two weeks.

226
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,840
And he was a true mentor.

227
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,440
And he was the one person I could have the very, very blunt conversations with.

228
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,639
And there were two-way conversations.

229
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,860
And he would say things to me like, Richard, our last six calls, you've raised this as

230
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,080
an issue.

231
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,159
When are you going to do something about it?

232
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,840
Sort of stuff, you know.

233
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:04,039
So I had a person in Chris who was just an incredible sounding board through my time

234
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,700
as CEO.

235
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,740
Because leadership can be lonely, Luke.

236
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,419
And everyone says it.

237
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,539
And early on in my tenure as CEO of West Farmers, I thought, oh, no, it's not...

238
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,240
You know, this is great.

239
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:14,919
And then after a while, you think, oh, no.

240
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,519
There are times when you are on your own.

241
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,259
You know, people come in, you should do this, you should do that.

242
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,779
And they close the door and walk out.

243
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,840
And you've sort of got to think, well, what are we going to do?

244
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,779
And so having a sounding board was great.

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,340
And I talked earlier, Gail Kelly, she took over Westpac at a similar time I took over

246
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,120
West Farmers.

247
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,580
I always had a great relationship with Gail.

248
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,120
You know, she's...

249
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,620
Mother of triplets and a female major bank CEO in Australia was just, you know, I think

250
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,539
is an incredible person.

251
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,279
And so people like that, you can pick up the phone and talk to her, always really valuable.

252
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,519
It sounds like you're smart enough to formalise that, you know, the Harvard business professor

253
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,820
to make that something you did as a routine.

254
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,919
Sounds like a really smart thing.

255
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,799
Richard, if there's one criticism that you hear about you, it's maybe that you don't

256
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,299
have a big public presence in the high profile.

257
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:06,659
Chairman?

258
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:06,799
Right?

259
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,139
And it's hard to get access to you.

260
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,620
And is that part because of, you know, the CEOs that you work with, Alan Joyce at Qantas

261
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,899
and Gil McLaughlin at the AFL, Meg O'Neill at Woodside, you allow them, you empower them

262
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,059
to do their job.

263
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,519
Is that your natural style or have you sort of adapted it because, hey, I've got really

264
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,379
capable people in those roles and I'm happy to take a back seat?

265
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,080
It's a bit of both, Luke.

266
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,639
So it's more my natural style.

267
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,720
I mean, I hate opening a newspaper and seeing a photo.

268
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,259
So maybe that's the farm boy bit in me.

269
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,240
I don't know how you go with that.

270
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,700
But I'm pretty clear on the difference between executive and non-executive roles.

271
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:58,620
And so I had three great chairs when I was at West Farmers, Trevor Eastwood, Bob Avery

272
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,720
and then Michael Chaney.

273
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,019
And they gave me the scope to be the CEO, to be the face.

274
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,139
That's when required of West Farmers.

275
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,139
And they were supportive in the background.

276
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:17,720
They were challenging when they needed to be, critical if they needed to be, but incredibly

277
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
supportive and also focused on the long term.

278
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,740
So I think I saw three very good role models as chair.

279
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,940
And I'm, you know, I'm non-executive chair.

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm non-executive.

281
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,220
And Gil runs the AFL.

282
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,860
And the commission is, which is, I think, a brilliant structure.

283
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,559
The commission.

284
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,059
It looks at the strategies Gil and the team sets.

285
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,500
We hire and fire the CEO.

286
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,740
There's things we do as non-executives.

287
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,679
But we don't run the AFL day to day.

288
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,679
And I don't run Qantas.

289
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,700
And although I get people ringing me up saying, where's my bag?

290
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,240
And Alan Joyce is an enormously capable CEO, as is Gil.

291
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:05,799
And one of the joys in my life for the last two years is seeing Meg O'Neill move into a leadership role at Woodside.

292
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,639
And then blossom as a leader.

293
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,960
And, you know, through her first time, we talked about Coles with me.

294
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,480
Woodside merged with BHP Petroleum Assets last year, which was similar size, massive.

295
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,940
You know, I think $16, $17, $18 billion.

296
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,539
It doesn't matter.

297
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
Big, big merger.

298
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,940
And Meg led that very early on in her tenure.

299
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,039
And I think she's already seen as a very, very, very highly capable CEO.

300
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,940
She's got terrific relationships with government and industry.

301
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,500
And it's been a joy for me to see her grow.

302
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,379
And, look, there's a bit.

303
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,419
I've had that.

304
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,159
I've done that.

305
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,460
And I don't seek the limelight.

306
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:53,539
I seek the AFL to be as good as it can be, Qantas to be as good as it can be, and Woodside to be as good as it can be.

307
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,940
And hopefully I can play a role in that.

308
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,620
But I know that I'm not the day-to-day person running it.

309
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,099
I know I get held accountable when we make mistakes.

310
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,380
And that's fine.

311
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:15,619
Richard, I want to talk about, you know, living in WA, you've come at a period of time where Western Australia was effectively cut off from the rest of the world for two years.

312
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,799
And towards the end, you made some pretty strong statements around not being sustainable.

313
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,099
If we look back, did we learn anything from the leadership in that time with a little bit of reflection there?

314
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,579
Oh, look, I could talk all day about that.

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,720
Actually, to its credit, the Western Australian Government's doing a review of its policies in COVID.

316
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,839
And I hope.

317
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,779
As a nation, we do a proper review of that.

318
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,799
And so I'll be pretty blunt in my input to the Western Australian Government.

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,019
I felt, yeah, I said a lot through those two or three years that leaders lead.

320
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:58,000
I think Gil McLaughlin and Alan Joyce did phenomenal jobs through the most challenging period.

321
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,059
They had great teams around them.

322
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,319
And they'd be the first to say that.

323
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,400
But for Qantas to survive COVID, for the AFL, frankly, to survive COVID.

324
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,240
To give the delight to our supporters that we did was pretty amazing.

325
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:20,400
I think we lost balance on risk management through COVID.

326
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,460
And early on, it was really difficult because no one knew where it was going.

327
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:32,460
But after a while, once a vaccine was developed and protocols were developed, it was, I think, far more manageable.

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,599
I think there were people like Gladys Berejiklian.

329
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,299
I absolutely canned by some people.

330
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:45,279
And yet I'd look back and say that that was a better way of treating people.

331
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,079
Because I reckon we just lost some of our humanity through COVID.

332
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:50,579
And I think it was all based on one thing.

333
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:57,859
And, look, if you took the same zero-risk approach that Western Australian Government apparently took

334
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:00,599
or appeared to take through that period, no one would drive vehicles anymore.

335
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,259
Or if we did, we'd drive at five kilometres per hour.

336
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,359
And you wouldn't play football.

337
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,700
Qantas would never fly an aeroplane.

338
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,380
Because, you know, there's always a tiny – you know, you just minimise the risk.

339
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,019
So I think we got that wrong.

340
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,000
Hopefully we can get it sorted.

341
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,880
You know, Australia was relatively better off than the rest of the world.

342
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,859
I think we're lucky in a broad context with the leadership we had.

343
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,200
I just think we lost a bit of humanity through that period.

344
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,920
And we lost perspective on where it was all at.

345
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,960
And I think it was really powerful to have senior people with influence like you,

346
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:39,619
you know, question that narrative because, you know,

347
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,559
it was an event that we hadn't experienced before.

348
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,839
And I think your words are really profound.

349
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,019
You know, we did lose humanity.

350
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,240
It was a pretty rough couple of years around the world.

351
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,119
But, you know, even here in Melbourne, we took kids out of school for two years.

352
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,619
We, you know, I looked – you're lucky to live in an expansive house.

353
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,500
I looked at people in the commission flats who couldn't get out with four or five –

354
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,779
there was some cruelty that went on that's got lasting consequences.

355
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,960
And if we don't have these conversations in leadership,

356
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,859
how are you going to learn next time?

357
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah, we need to.

358
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,839
And we all – I mean, I've made plenty of mistakes, Luke.

359
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,880
And we – I often thought about those people in the housing commission

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,119
where English is second language and those kids miss two years of school.

361
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,859
What's the impact going to be in 10 or 20 years' time?

362
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,319
And we had – we had two children in Melbourne, a daughter here most of the time.

363
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,339
And at one stage, you know, and she'd planned to get married, I think, in 21.

364
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,759
In Perth, that got cancelled because borders got closed.

365
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:35,839
And she – I don't know.

366
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:35,960
I don't know.

367
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know.

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,019
I don't know.

369
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:36,779
And she was lucky.

370
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,019
She had a partner and the two of them were happy together.

371
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,480
But her mental health suffered like many people in Victoria.

372
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,539
And at one stage, I said to Janine, you might have to go to Melbourne.

373
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:52,000
And I'm not sure when I'll see you again because you're not going to be allowed back to Perth.

374
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,279
But you might have to go to look after our daughter.

375
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,079
And they're cruel decisions.

376
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,619
And, you know, there were people who weren't able to fly interstate to see dying relatives.

377
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:06,000
There were people who weren't able to be in the same room as their husband

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,740
or father or mother dying or weren't able to go and pick up bodies.

379
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,460
And there was some crazy stuff.

380
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,279
And hopefully, as you say, we can have a sensible conversation about how we do it better next time.

381
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,859
I want to ask you about this sort of cancelled culture world we live in now.

382
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,539
I love you saying openly you make mistakes.

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,299
We all do.

384
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,619
It's part of how you grow.

385
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,680
Hopefully, you don't make them, you know, two in a row, particularly some of the big decisions you make.

386
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,980
But we want to try and encourage – are you concerned, particularly in the –

387
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,039
we like to attack Qantas and we like to attack the AFL

388
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:47,259
and it doesn't seem to be that good-natured capacity to slip up occasionally.

389
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,980
Excuse me, is that a concern for you?

390
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,880
Yeah, it is.

391
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:57,299
And you've put it well, Luke, because, I mean, there's more instant feedback on this stuff now.

392
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,660
And it's quite personal.

393
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,160
So I've actually pulled back from social media a bit because,

394
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,759
it'd just kill you if you took seriously what people say about you.

395
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,900
I don't know if you – where you're at on – because you'd get plenty of feedback as well.

396
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,119
Well, I share this story, Richard.

397
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,299
I'm sorry to jump in, but Luke Hodger, you know well, and he – I've told this story.

398
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,380
He doesn't mind me telling it.

399
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,119
One of the greats of our game, a Colac boy, not the similar background to you,

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,220
but as iconic a leader as we've got in our game.

401
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,160
I did one of the first games in commentary with Hodgie and second game he'd done it.

402
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:35,140
So you're learning and you're nervous and at halftime,

403
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,480
he went to check his phone to see how the kids were going and he scrolled onto social media

404
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,420
and he showed me some of the stuff that – I'm going, if Luke Hodger's copying, you know,

405
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,099
you are an idiot, you can't speak, you can't – I just was dumbfounded.

406
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:51,619
And it knocked Luke Hodger out.

407
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,079
It knocked him around in the second half.

408
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,200
And I think, God, if someone with that level of resilience is susceptible,

409
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,880
what are our teenage kids going to be able to cope with?

410
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,559
It's crazy.

411
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,140
Yeah, and in a high-profile role, it's like Gil McLaughlin.

412
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,779
He at the AFL or Alan Joyce.

413
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,059
I mean, Alan Joyce and his partner Shane bought a house in Sydney

414
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,559
and it got eggs thrown at it and toilet paper and, you know, vandalised.

415
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,799
Now, Alan's – at the end of the day, Alan is a great guy.

416
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,400
He's been a superb leader of Qantas.

417
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,259
Do we get everything right?

418
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:32,460
No, but is Qantas as good as any airline in the world in my view?

419
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes.

420
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,200
And did we get through COVID?

421
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,460
We did amazingly well, yes.

422
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,059
And I don't think we cut people any slack these days.

423
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,599
And politically, you know, you'd ask the question,

424
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,559
why would you be in politics these days given what they cop?

425
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,140
I remember Gil saying to me one day, you know,

426
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,500
even for the most popular decisions we make at the AFL,

427
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:56,960
there's still people who hate it.

428
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,119
And they express that hate.

429
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,160
Look, it's really interesting.

430
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,839
I think we've sort of got to get the balance slightly better

431
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,160
than we've currently got at the moment.

432
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,660
And so I've done a couple of speeches at graduation ceremonies

433
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,579
at universities and things in recent years.

434
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,000
And I say – I try and say it in a positive way.

435
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,200
I say to these unbelievably well-educated kids who are going to be our leaders

436
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,819
going forward, if you want to make change, make change.

437
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,000
But having an opinion on social media is not –

438
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,079
you're not the one making –

439
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,279
you're far better off being the one criticised who's made the change

440
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,539
than being some anonymous person on social media having a go.

441
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:46,920
And in my view, that's what –

442
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,299
we should be applauding the people who are actually doing stuff

443
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,960
and recognising from time to time we get it wrong.

444
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,240
You know, we were talking about West Farmers earlier and Coles

445
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,099
and things like that.

446
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,920
Look, if the West Farmers Board had acted like –

447
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,099
social media does this way,

448
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,619
I would have been fired 15 times in my 12-year tenure.

449
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,640
But they took a view, which I'm forever grateful,

450
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,220
that I'd learn from mistakes.

451
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,680
I'd hopefully grow as a person and grow as a CEO.

452
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,759
And they also took a long-term view.

453
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,079
And they knew that we'd make mistakes from time to time.

454
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,779
But hopefully, as you said earlier, we get more right than wrong.

455
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,079
And you actually – you know, you come out – you're ahead of the game.

456
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,839
You're a winner.

457
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:30,900
You're a winner.

458
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:31,839
But if –

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,380
if I reacted to every time someone said I need to make a change at Qantas

460
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,980
or, you know – everyone loves Gill, obviously.

461
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,420
But, you know, I tell you, it would just be a –

462
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,720
you know, we'd be rotating through people and things like that.

463
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,680
So we've got to – I think we've got to get better at it.

464
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,400
And I'm going to be – I'm now 63, Luke.

465
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,700
You know, I've got a Woodside AGM coming up soon.

466
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm going to have people coming along with the AGM

467
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,140
saying you're not doing enough on climate change.

468
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,299
There's – there'll be some who are legitimate,

469
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,200
will have a very good, healthy debate.

470
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,839
There's some who just don't want us to be in business.

471
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,339
My response to that is fine, but that's not my job.

472
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,259
My job's not actually to – my job's actually to make Woodside as good as it can be.

473
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:18,519
Yeah.

474
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,259
And your agenda is to get us out of this business.

475
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,259
There's no point in us talking.

476
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
There's no conversation.

477
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:25,500
There's no conversation.

478
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:25,759
Yeah.

479
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,380
Yeah.

480
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,480
Yeah.

481
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,559
So what – sitting back at that stage of your life, you said 63,

482
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,660
someone that's listening to this and about to start an entrepreneurial journey

483
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,640
or whatever passion they've got, what advice would you give?

484
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,319
I reckon that word passion is really important.

485
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,140
I think you've got to love what you do.

486
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,160
And so I would say for almost every day of my working life,

487
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,940
I've jumped out of bed in the morning wanting to get to work and wanting to do things.

488
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,539
There was one period where I worked for someone who I lost respect for

489
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:00,480
and I didn't enjoy.

490
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,339
I didn't enjoy it at all.

491
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,539
And so I made a change because I couldn't deal with it.

492
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,140
Left the organisation?

493
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,160
It wasn't quite like that.

494
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,039
Basically, I said I was going to leave the organisation and they went,

495
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:13,319
oh, is there a problem here?

496
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,180
And they worked it out.

497
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:14,859
Yeah.

498
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,660
But that was a brief period in my entire career.

499
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,859
Otherwise, you know, I jumped out of bed this morning.

500
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,819
I thought, this is going to be great today.

501
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,779
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

502
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,680
Gil and I are going to do a walk around Marvel Stadium in a minute,

503
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,940
which will be interesting to see where that's at.

504
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,539
I've got to –

505
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,700
We've got a Telethon Trust meeting later today.

506
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,359
We raised over $70 million for kids' health in Western Australia last year.

507
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,200
So I'm passionate about it.

508
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,380
And I say to our kids and to others who listen to me,

509
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,000
you're going to be working for a long time.

510
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,400
Make sure you enjoy it and work with good people.

511
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,599
Yeah.

512
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:56,039
And be proud that you can do something and make a contribution.

513
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,519
One of the reasons I love AFL is because of what we do.

514
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,240
We do it in the communities.

515
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,539
And you talked about Tamblup.

516
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,440
And I used to go on a Sunday with Mum and Dad and drive the car

517
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,940
and we'd back it up against the fence and watch.

518
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,700
In those days in Tamblup, the Farmers and the Williams,

519
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,079
you know, Geoffrey's father and the Williams play footy.

520
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,240
And we've got a holiday house down on the south coast of WA,

521
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,119
a little fishing town called Augusta.

522
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,259
And the Augusta Abalones kicked off again two or three years ago.

523
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,359
And they play about –

524
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,440
They play about ten games a year, five games at home.

525
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,859
And it's just so brilliant because the whole community comes to watch

526
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:43,099
the Abalones play local teams in footy.

527
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:49,000
So I just think we do great stuff in the AFL.

528
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,619
And if you can be part of that as an organisation, that's quite fulfilling.

529
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,019
What a brilliant name for a team.

530
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,599
The Abalones.

531
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,579
I'd like to see them play one day.

532
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:59,420
They'd love you.

533
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,220
You should come play with them.

534
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, they haven't seen me lately, Richard.

535
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,779
I'm not sure if I can help the Abalones too much.

536
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:05,960
But it's true.

537
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:09,900
Before we hit record, all we wanted to talk about was who did you tip this week

538
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,039
and where are you going to be tonight.

539
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,160
And you can see that passion comes out.

540
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,819
Well, the Abalones, the coach is the local Tyler.

541
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,799
The runner is the local gas, Rob Gossie, the local gas guy.

542
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,720
The first aid lady is the local IGA checkout woman.

543
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,059
It's the whole community.

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
You know, I'm sure the police.

545
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,099
Breath test people on the way in.

546
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,059
And then go.

547
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,839
You know, because it's just, it's one of those, it's, you know,

548
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,480
it's what footy does, which I think is bring communities together.

549
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,819
And that's why I love the involvement of the AFL.

550
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,079
We love going and seeing the elite men and women.

551
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,039
And, you know, you're lucky enough to have played

552
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,880
and been a very good player at that level and would have met amazing people.

553
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,380
But footy's big in the community.

554
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,339
And if you haven't been to a country footy game and, you know,

555
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,099
I lived in a place called Roxby Downs in Central Australia

556
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,680
and to see what it does or to go up to the Tiwi Islands

557
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,779
and watch a Tiwi grandfire.

558
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,539
Oh, if you can't get joy out of what footy does in that space,

559
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,440
it's hard not to.

560
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,579
I know you want to finish, but a few years ago I went up to the Kimberley

561
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:21,039
as a West Farmers team, but with another group,

562
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,059
just looking at Indigenous disadvantage and issues.

563
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,900
And we went to this little remote town in the East Kimberley.

564
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,579
I think it was called Ring of Soak.

565
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:33,559
And Colin Carter, and you know Colin,

566
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,680
an AFL commissioner, chairman of Geelong, was on the trip.

567
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,059
And he was a director of West Farmers at the time.

568
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,720
And this local community that we flew into had heard

569
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,759
that this Geelong person was coming.

570
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,640
So they all expected a Geelong AFL player.

571
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,660
Gary Avlett was coming.

572
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,940
And Colin rolled up and, you know, Colin carrying a bit of weight,

573
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,380
less hair than me.

574
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,819
But they were all incredibly passionate.

575
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,900
And this oval.

576
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,700
Was, and we've all seen photos, but this oval was a dirt and stone oval

577
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,559
with a tree at centre half forward.

578
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,680
But footy was sort of their life on a weekend.

579
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,700
So you're right.

580
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,440
Great privilege of our club chaplain in my era used to run a red dust role models

581
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,579
and take us as players out to remote communities and you'd stay out for a week.

582
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,779
Literally forged these relationships where you could come back

583
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:28,380
and someone would take your name, you know, and you'd come back

584
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,339
and you'd meet Luke Darcy.

585
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,359
Two years later and just say, that's my name.

586
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,559
It's not my name now.

587
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:39,920
It's, you can't describe, you know, the joy of, there was a,

588
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,839
I had a great teammate, Matthew Croft.

589
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,640
It wasn't at my high profile, but they loved Matthew Croft.

590
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,319
There was a couple of Matthew Crofts running around

591
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,500
in the Tiwi Islands there at one stage.

592
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,039
I'm not sure if there's a Colin Carter.

593
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,960
Hey, Richard, so I had a great privilege of sitting down.

594
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,980
I love these conversations.

595
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,539
You learn so much from them and see these sort of key common traits

596
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,339
around different leadership positions.

597
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,420
I was keen to ask you about them and fascinated to get your response.

598
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,579
And we think it's hard to lead anyone else unless you have a sense

599
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:08,640
of self-leadership.

600
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,140
Does that resonate with you?

601
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,259
Yeah, yeah, it does.

602
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,779
And I think that goes to your values.

603
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,700
It goes to your own sort of compass, personal compass.

604
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,079
And I've always said if you're not prepared to do it yourself,

605
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,259
you certainly can't ask anyone else to do it.

606
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
So, yeah, it does resonate, yeah.

607
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,099
We think our leaders are really, modern leaders are really conscious

608
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,099
about every moment.

609
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,900
And having a positive impact on whatever environment they're in,

610
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,559
is that something you think of?

611
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,079
Yeah, it's interesting.

612
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:42,519
One of the things I've always tried to do, Luke, is be positive

613
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,240
even when things were terribly difficult.

614
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,359
And sometimes they are.

615
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,180
And there was a, you know, when I was looking to retire

616
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,299
as CEO of West Farmers, there were some internal candidates.

617
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:06,099
And one of the internal candidates and I had a terrific conversation

618
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,599
and this person is someone I really admire and respect.

619
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,160
But there were times when that person was not able to put a front on,

620
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,640
which is actually we're going to work this through,

621
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,359
we're going to be positive.

622
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,900
And you can't have a leader come into a place like the AFL or whatever

623
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,220
just like the world's going to fall over because that impacts everyone.

624
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,200
So I think you've got...

625
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,039
You can't internalise all the issues because if you do,

626
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:36,839
you're not going to solve them.

627
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,039
The best way of solving issues is to make sure your team's aware of them

628
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,259
and you're bored or whatever.

629
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,259
But I think as a leader, you have to have a positive.

630
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,980
You have to be able to say, we're going to work our way through this.

631
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,079
It might take us a bit of time and it might be hard,

632
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,539
but we're going to work our way through it.

633
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,259
And that's why Gil's leadership through COVID

634
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,180
and Alan Joyce's leadership through COVID was so powerful.

635
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,160
I think because Alan said,

636
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:06,619
Qantas was six weeks away from insolvency basically,

637
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,059
but tough decisions, really tough decisions,

638
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,380
but people respecting that because there was an optimism

639
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,579
that we'd get through it.

640
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,980
And jumping off on this topic, I hadn't planned to do it,

641
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,980
but Gil was incredibly, always is when you see him

642
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,019
and remarkable effort for the whole AFL and Gil in particular

643
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:29,320
and his team through commissioning.

644
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,159
You're in the process.

645
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,460
You're in the process of the replacement challenge.

646
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,559
That creates a level of angst in a game like footy.

647
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,139
We all want the answer and everyone wants to know.

648
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,920
Everyone wants a timeline, Richard.

649
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,079
How are you handling that situation?

650
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,679
And obviously it's really capable people in this building we're here with now.

651
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,039
How do you handle that?

652
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,480
Well, actually, I'm loving it, Luke, to be honest.

653
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,940
I mean, because I think the reality with Gil is he made an announcement

654
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,760
in where it was April last year saying he would finish up

655
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,480
at the end of last year.

656
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,079
And then the Hawthorne.

657
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,079
And then the Hawthorne was getting lobbed on us.

658
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,980
And, you know, we, Gil and I, got a terrific relationship

659
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,599
and we just felt inappropriate for him to go at that time.

660
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,619
And don't forget, last year we're still sort of getting through COVID

661
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,599
and restrictions and a whole lot of things like that.

662
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
So we're in good shape.

663
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,159
I'm enjoying.

664
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,880
Why are you loving it?

665
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,320
Because I'm having, I'm spending time talking about pretty important stuff

666
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,280
with really good people.

667
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,519
Yeah.

668
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Fellow commissioners.

669
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,159
Also, you talked about people in this place at AFL House,

670
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,500
people outside of AFL House.

671
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,360
There's some really interesting people whose names have come up

672
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,440
that I've been able to have one-on-one conversations with

673
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
and then conversations with the commission.

674
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,579
And it's, I really enjoy it.

675
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:50,539
And it's arguably the most important thing we'll do as a commission

676
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,420
is to appoint a CEO.

677
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:56,219
So, you know, I'm going to make sure we get it right.

678
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,860
And people said, oh, you took too long to appoint a CEO.

679
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,199
Woodside, Meg was acting CEO for four months.

680
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,059
We went through a process which was really challenging

681
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,139
because of COVID travel restrictions at the time.

682
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,539
We made the right call.

683
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,219
And if we make the right call, I'm happy.

684
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,519
And I'll wear the flack on the way through.

685
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,800
You've got a big smile on your face.

686
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,360
Does it run the risk that those that are in the team,

687
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,159
that there's a distress level for others as can?

688
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:29,300
Is that a potential negative that it looks as though maybe, you know,

689
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,099
you haven't got people.

690
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:30,900
It can fill the role.

691
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,619
Has that become challenging?

692
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,219
Well, hopefully the candidates have all had enough feedback from me

693
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,480
and others on where the process is at.

694
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,679
Yeah, there's, as you know, last year we did media rights.

695
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,119
As I said, the Hawthorne thing,

696
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,239
there's a few things on the go at the moment.

697
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,000
Tasmania is not unimportant for the AFL, I think.

698
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,340
And Gil's doing a stupendous job on that

699
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,900
because it's not just negotiations with the Tasmanian and federal governments.

700
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:59,599
It's working with the 18 clubs as well.

701
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,639
And, you know, we'll see whether we can land Tasmania.

702
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,500
If we can, it's a big deal for the AFL.

703
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,280
So there's a few things going on that I think are more appropriately handled

704
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,559
while he's still in the seat.

705
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,579
And Gil's been amazing in that I've got no doubt his phone's been ringing,

706
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,840
but his commitment to the AFL is, and, you know, no one has seen,

707
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,599
if anything, we've just seen a more engaged, more fired up CEO,

708
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,059
not someone who's looking to exit stage left at the moment.

709
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,599
And you don't have to be a cheerleader.

710
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,519
The record of Gil and the rights and the AFL's health

711
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,980
and coming through that speaks for itself.

712
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,000
And I think everyone in our industry can't be anything apart from universally

713
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,139
admiring the role that Gil's played.

714
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,800
And, you know, I love that you're enjoying the time.

715
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,019
I find that interesting.

716
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:55,159
We see, you know, in a lot of the roles you're in,

717
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,800
leaders are really conscious of how they share the vision

718
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,579
for what they want to do.

719
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,659
How do you go about that in the various roles that you've got,

720
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,760
creating and sharing a vision?

721
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,280
So I reckon it's different as a CEO than as a non-executive.

722
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:17,179
I love being chair because I think you've got more influence as a chair,

723
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:20,940
obviously, than you do purely as a non-executive.

724
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,059
And so in my view, the vision of the AFL is something for Gil

725
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:29,159
and the team to come up with.

726
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,079
For the commission to critique and hopefully critique maybe help make better

727
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,139
but then come behind and support.

728
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,400
And the same with, you know, listed companies and the like.

729
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,280
I think, though, having clarity of direction is incredibly important, Luke.

730
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,699
And as a leader, one of the reasons I said Michael Chaney was a great mentor

731
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:56,739
was I was always very clear with what Michael wanted from me

732
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,119
as someone working for him.

733
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,579
So hopefully the people...

734
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,400
The people who work for me, either as executives when I was a CEO

735
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,340
or now as CEOs, are really clear.

736
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:13,519
And the first thing is integrity is non-negotiable.

737
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,480
You know, we're not compromised on that.

738
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:22,639
If you're a listed company, then it's pretty clear that you're looking

739
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,739
to create value for your stakeholders, including your shareholders.

740
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:29,500
And for the AFL, you know, we have a vision that we all jump

741
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,619
in behind and you and I, the way...

742
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,940
The conversation we've just had basically goes to that vision

743
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,219
about how we make the game better and inclusive for all Australians.

744
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,519
So...

745
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,940
But that clarity...

746
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,460
So you have to be clear in your own mind about where you're going, I think,

747
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,900
and then being clear, making sure that others are clear are important.

748
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:57,719
And the bit on integrity is, I think, really important.

749
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,980
Holding people accountable.

750
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,420
I think that's really important for results, good and bad.

751
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,820
But as I think I said earlier, I don't worry what people say about me.

752
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,420
Although if they question my integrity, I'd worry about that.

753
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,059
But I do worry about what they say about the organisations.

754
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:20,420
And I hate the integrity of organisations I'm involved in to be attacked.

755
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,900
And so they're things that, to me, become not negotiable.

756
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,139
And I think I heard you in a very similar vein, just saying we're going

757
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,219
to have lots of debates.

758
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:29,480
And...

759
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,539
And lots of blues, and you can disagree, but integrity stands alone.

760
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:36,480
And a question on that, that's a separate conversation.

761
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,340
And, yeah, it makes sense, yeah.

762
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,280
And it's one of the interesting dynamics about, I think,

763
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,559
a management team, Luke, and a board, is you actually want lively debate.

764
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:49,659
You want diversity of views around a table.

765
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,820
Because you'll get better outcomes with it.

766
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:57,519
But when you leave, you've got to have a unified voice.

767
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,219
And if you don't...

768
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,320
If people play politics, that can be very destructive in an organisation.

769
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,579
And so I think how you manage boards around confidentiality,

770
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:12,940
but having that openness, and your own management teams as well,

771
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,320
I think becomes really important.

772
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,940
And, you know, there should be a diversity of views,

773
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,199
but eventually you should come to a landing.

774
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,320
And once you've come to a landing...

775
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,179
And if you can't live with that, go and do something.

776
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:25,820
Then you're out.

777
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,440
Then you're out.

778
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,980
Go and do something else.

779
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,780
So I'm bored.

780
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:32,360
Even if you disagree, eventually you have to come to a united front.

781
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,920
And without that, there's no harmony, yeah.

782
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,800
And one of the challenges of being a chair or a CEO

783
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,699
is getting to that position without compromising on every front.

784
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,039
Because sometimes you think,

785
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,340
geez, do we actually make a decision here or not?

786
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,280
So anyway, it's one of the challenges.

787
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:53,599
Richard, we see leaders are really curious people.

788
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,980
And curiosity is a way that they launch into their own self-improvement and development.

789
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,199
Does that word resonate?

790
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,099
Does that resonate with you, curiosity?

791
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,019
Curiosity, yeah, you know, sort of deep scanning.

792
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,599
I can't help myself but be looking at what's going on around the place,

793
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,539
whether that's economically, whether that's politically, whether the whole...

794
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,139
So I'm curious.

795
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,500
I have a view on a lot of things.

796
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,500
I have to hold myself back sometimes.

797
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,780
I've made the mistake plenty of times in my life thinking I'm right

798
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,260
and something worked out that I wasn't.

799
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:31,460
And that's why it's really good to have people around you

800
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,539
who can have a different view.

801
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:39,099
But yeah, I think the world's in a really interesting place at the moment.

802
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,460
I've got four kids, first grandchild now.

803
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,099
So I want the world to be a good place for them to be in.

804
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,960
And so I'm really interested in stuff.

805
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,659
Sometimes I think, no, let it go, let others deal with it,

806
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,460
and I'll go up to the farm and run around the sheep or something.

807
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,079
But there's others.

808
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,099
I just can't help myself.

809
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,199
And I have to pick up the phone and ring someone and say,

810
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,760
are they serious about this?

811
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,280
Are we doing this?

812
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,300
So yeah, I'm...

813
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,739
So you hold yourself back on purpose, do you?

814
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:09,960
Sometimes.

815
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:12,340
Yeah, because you just think it's not worth it or...?

816
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,039
Yeah, sometimes because I think actually they don't know.

817
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,800
Someone doesn't need to hear from me on this.

818
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,440
So yeah, I'm probably a bit better than I was five or ten years ago.

819
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,500
But have you picked up the phone and thought,

820
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,780
you know, I can probably reach people that others can't?

821
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,719
And have you done that from time to time as well on an issue?

822
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,579
That you care about?

823
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,539
Yeah, I have.

824
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,480
And hopefully I don't abuse that.

825
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:36,840
So hopefully people respect it.

826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,320
Yeah, and I'm lucky and I've got a really good network of contacts

827
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,719
and I've got people who reach out to me from time to time as well.

828
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,860
So that's fine.

829
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,800
But one of the key things is I listen to my kids a lot.

830
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,800
You know, they're great kids.

831
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:01,619
And I think sometimes you've got to make sure you look in the mirror

832
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,980
and say, who are you?

833
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,579
And do you really understand some of the stuff that's going on

834
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,280
and that's important?

835
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,800
So, yeah.

836
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,900
Which is a great parenting skill, isn't it?

837
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,860
As you get all your great teachers are there right in front of you.

838
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,019
I know I get plenty of feedback from my floor as well, Richard,

839
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:18,980
whether I like it or not.

840
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,199
Communicating with clarity is another dimension of leadership.

841
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,719
We see people in roles like yours are very clear on their communication.

842
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:28,300
How have you gone about that?

843
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,920
Well, yeah, I think I've, you know, there's been a journey, Luke.

844
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,719
I've learned to be a bit more direct with people without,

845
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,059
hopefully without being sort of rude and impolite.

846
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,460
But so I can have very direct conversations with people with, you know,

847
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:58,039
whether it's Alan or Gil or Meg or directors because I think that clarity

848
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:58,900
is important.

849
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,139
And do I enjoy sitting down with someone and say,

850
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,000
I think you did a really rubbish job?

851
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:04,380
No.

852
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,099
You know, I don't know who enjoys that stuff.

853
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:11,420
But have I learned to sit down and say, actually, you know,

854
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,579
you could have done that better and these are what I think you should have done.

855
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,639
I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was 20 years ago.

856
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,440
And it's a skill I think you sort of have to develop.

857
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,099
But also, you know, I've also, I've had feedback along the way that people

858
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,599
felt they weren't getting enough feedback from me.

859
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:33,840
And I was shocked when I got that feedback.

860
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,280
I thought, oh, gee, I'm pretty good at that.

861
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,260
And then I reflected on it and said, actually, no, I'm not.

862
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm bloody hopeless at it in the circumstances I was talking about.

863
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,380
So, yeah, hopefully I'm a bit better.

864
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:45,400
It also comes with relationships, I think.

865
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:51,739
Once you build trust with someone, you can have that much more direct conversation.

866
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:55,739
Well, you really see that shift to collaboration.

867
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:58,800
How important has collaboration been for you?

868
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,539
As a leader?

869
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,539
Well, there's nothing better, I think, as a leadership team

870
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:07,739
in agreeing something and then making it happen.

871
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:12,619
Early on in my schoolboy life, I rode.

872
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,079
I wasn't a great rower.

873
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,639
My brother was a much better rower than me.

874
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:18,500
But I rode because I got better food at the boarding school.

875
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,300
But those moments in an eight when everything comes together,

876
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:24,639
I don't know if you ever rode,

877
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,500
but those moments when everything clicks and you're at one,

878
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,320
is one of those magic, magic moments.

879
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,480
I keep sort of thinking about that sometimes in corporate life.

880
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:41,460
So the best times in my corporate life were in an office with a whole team

881
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,619
working on a difficult issue, whether it was an acquisition

882
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,539
or just a challenge in the business and working our way through it

883
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,219
and coming out, that is so good.

884
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:58,300
And particularly when the best ideas come from the most unlikely source.

885
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,579
And I love that sort of stuff.

886
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,280
I love that sort of teamwork, collaboration.

887
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah, it's great.

888
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,199
Yeah, and I love hearing you say that.

889
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,800
The rowing analogy, I didn't know nothing about,

890
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,579
but my daughter, I've had this great joy of watching her.

891
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:17,639
I have a proud dad moment here for a moment, Richard,

892
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:19,940
but they competed over in Henley last year.

893
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,800
And it's the ultimate team sport, isn't it?

894
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,320
In an eight, they had this incredible success and won over in Henley.

895
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:27,780
And you're thinking,

896
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,579
one person puts that oar in the wrong spot once, and it's unlikely.

897
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:34,280
And you look at the crew and you think,

898
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,880
God, that doesn't look like they should go fast.

899
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,519
But sometimes when it works, there's magic in it, isn't it?

900
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:44,219
And you actually know when you're in a crew, you can see the puddles.

901
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,159
So you know who's working and you know who's not.

902
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,500
You can.

903
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,519
And we've all been there.

904
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:53,659
We've all been not on our game.

905
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,079
Yeah.

906
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,860
And you know, yeah.

907
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,440
And you know when you're not on your game.

908
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,019
But when it all clicks, it's pretty magic.

909
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:01,719
Yeah.

910
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,360
I can't help it, you know, that poor Olympic moment,

911
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,920
which we'll never forget, and I shouldn't bring it up,

912
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,639
but thinking of the Olympic final in a team situation like that,

913
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,760
where clearly you couldn't go on.

914
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,079
But, you know, that would stay with you for a long time, I'm assuming.

915
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,539
Two final questions.

916
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:22,980
Richard, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

917
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:26,920
Oh, I think Mandela's the –

918
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,340
you know, and I think he's –

919
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,360
what he did, what he went through, his humility,

920
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:41,780
his clarity when, you know, after years of being locked up.

921
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,699
I was lucky enough to see him at Harvard back in 98 when I was over there,

922
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,119
and it was one of those literally spine-chilling moments,

923
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,739
and it was with a whole bunch of other students at Harvard.

924
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,480
Did he come and do a guest lecture?

925
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,159
He was given an award, which I think only previously had been given to Churchill

926
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,039
and one other – it might have been FDA –

927
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,000
one other – so the third time ever that this award had been given.

928
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,820
And it was at Harvard Square, and, you know, I was –

929
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,739
at the time in 98, I was, what, 38, but there's all these Harvard students,

930
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:24,960
and it was just unbelievable to be sort of in the distance, but in his presence.

931
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,739
I just think as a leader, he –

932
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,699
he exhibited the things that you'd want to see, as I said,

933
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:35,519
humility, grace, direction, compassion.

934
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:36,940
Amazing.

935
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:37,460
Yeah.

936
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,760
I think we're about to get wound up in the Brownlow room here at the AFL.

937
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,539
I think our meeting's about to expire.

938
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:43,400
One final question.

939
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:45,000
It's handy when you've got the chairman here.

940
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,519
I'll get my final question away before we get to –

941
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,840
in the spirit of collaboration, I love – you know, I read out the start.

942
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,079
You're raising money for juvenile diabetes research.

943
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,599
The Western Australian Telethon is iconic in what it's done.

944
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:02,559
All your passions.

945
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,260
If you could collaborate with anyone, maybe Mandela might be the answer.

946
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,099
Is there anyone that you thought, if I could collaborate with someone,

947
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:08,679
that would be it?

948
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,800
Like, such a – you know, I love doing the work here with Gil and the team

949
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,880
and in other places.

950
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:27,420
I'm a massive admirer of Barack Obama, and I met him at the time of the Australian G20

951
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:27,760
in –

952
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,699
in 2014 when I was running the B20.

953
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,179
And he's a farm boy from Tambalup sitting next to him

954
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,000
and having a conversation with the President of the United States,

955
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,199
which was pretty surreal for me.

956
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:44,420
And I had a genuinely good conversation with him.

957
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,480
And he invited me to the White House, but, you know, subsequently,

958
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:51,400
there's no way he can get through all those bloody protocols.

959
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,219
But I'd love – I'd love to work with him on something

960
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,219
because I just think he's an outstanding person.

961
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,900
You know, not without his faults, and I've read his books.

962
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,820
I don't know if you've read his books.

963
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,059
And, yeah, he – but I'd love to do something with him

964
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:06,760
because I reckon he'd get some stuff done.

965
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,139
And just the class and the humility, the way he's handed himself post his time as President.

966
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,059
See, I mean, you speak about he must have wanted to pick up the phone from time to time.

967
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,039
He hasn't spoken out, has he?

968
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:22,340
He's just – he's – talk about values and integrity there at the top of the tree, aren't they, Richard?

969
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,239
It's been a class act.

970
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,980
This is a hugely busy time.

971
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,119
I think every day is a busy time.

972
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,679
I appreciate you taking –

973
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,760
some time to spend with me, and good luck for a big year.

974
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,360
Pleasure, Luke.

975
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:31,539
Yeah.

976
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:32,079
Thanks again.

977
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:32,719
And go the doggies.

978
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,500
Yeah, thanks.

979
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,260
