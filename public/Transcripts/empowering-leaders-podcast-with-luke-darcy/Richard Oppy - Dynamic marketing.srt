1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,650
This week's conversation is with an amazing leader

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,330
and a great friend of mine, Richard Oppie.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,890
Richard is the Vice President of Global Brands

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,530
at beverage giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in New York.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,149
Richard's incredible success in the corporate world

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:21,809
is a great story in itself.

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,010
He now oversees the branding strategies

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,109
of some of the world's most iconic beers,

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,969
like Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,969
In this conversation, we get behind-the-scenes insights

11
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,429
about the controversial World Cup decision

12
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,969
to ban Budweiser from their stadiums

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,750
just before the event kicked off

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,469
and see how Richard and his team

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,390
took to what could have been an international marketing disaster

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,609
and flipped it into an iconic campaign for the brand.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,710
Richard is a great modern leader

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,189
and is changing the game in brand and marketing

19
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,049
around the world on a global scale.

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,810
His passion for what he does

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,630
is one of the fundamentals for the work we do

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,289
at our leadership business, Alita.

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,969
We're incredibly humbled and proud to work with people

24
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,490
like Richard Oppie at Alita.

25
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,090

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,189

to get started and to understand how people like Richard

33
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,709
are leading in your world.

34
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,750
Richard Oppie is Vice President of Global Brands

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,390
for Anheuser-Busch InBev,

36
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,829
the largest consumer goods company in the world

37
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,230
with leading beer brands in over 100 countries,

38
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,209
including Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois and many more.

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,209
Given the scale and reach of the business,

40
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,109
Richard's role is arguably

41
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,989
the biggest marketing job in the world,

42
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,849
a role Richard secured before his 40th birthday

43
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,430
on the back of his reputation

44
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,569
for making courageous decisions, innovation,

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,409
creativity and consistent success.

46
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,450
Rich, great to see you back.

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,170
You're in your old hometown of Melbourne,

48
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,010
fresh in from New York.

49
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,329
Been an amazing time in your life.

50
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,730
Thanks for having me, Darce.

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,389
It's good to be back and back in the studio.

52
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,889
Now, Rich, I think the first time we met,

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,210
we might've crossed over at Junior Footy at Auskick

54
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,789
if I'm wrong.

55
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:13,909
I'm not sure.

56
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:13,930
I'm not sure.

57
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:13,969
I'm not sure.

58
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm not sure.

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,090
I'm not sure.

60
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,110
I'm not sure.

61
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,129
I'm not sure.

62
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:14,150
I'm not sure.

63
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,009
or close enough to it.

64
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,669
I was doing Breakfast Radio at the time

65
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,889
on Triple M with Eddie McGuire and Mick Malloy

66
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,550
and my co-host Mick Malloy broke a story

67
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,810
on our show about Victoria Bitter.

68
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,009
For those listening,

69
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,930
the famous VB in the town we're in

70
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,789
is the drink of choice for everyone,

71
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,250
really, in the state of Victoria,

72
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,449
one of the most famous beers in Australia.

73
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,729
And there was a story that there was going

74
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,889
to be a change in the recipe,

75
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,169
back to the original recipe.

76
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,689
And from what I remember, Rich,

77
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:44,110
that nearly got you to the point

78
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,330
where it got you in a fair bit of trouble,

79
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:47,509
your association with me in that story.

80
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,150
Can you pick it up?

81
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,750
Is my version right?

82
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:50,909
What do you remember from that one?

83
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,590
We're going back now,

84
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,689
but I remember having a chat to you at football

85
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,909
and then on Monday,

86
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,650
there was a leak,

87
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,750
was it the Mickey leak,

88
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,210
back in the day,

89
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:04,370
talking about Victoria Bitter

90
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,830
going back to the big cold beer,

91
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,090
back to 4.9% alcohol.

92
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,990
And yeah,

93
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,969
I wanted to know where that came from

94
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,569
and I certainly didn't divulge

95
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,050
the conversation,

96
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,370
I had with you at the time.

97
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,349
Well, so Mick was doing a segment

98
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,729
called Mickey leaks on the back

99
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,229
of Wiki leaks was the biggest story

100
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,189
in the world at the time.

101
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,229
So he wasn't really a newsbreaker,

102
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,189
but that was a story close to his heart

103
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,449
as a man who loved VB more than anyone else.

104
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:28,870
And the fascinating part was

105
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,469
that I had no insight at all on that.

106
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,030
So you and I hadn't spoken about

107
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
that being the case.

108
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,110
So he'd somehow got his own version

109
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,710
of that story,

110
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,849
but your colleagues at CAB at the time

111
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:39,909
were calling you Ricky leaks,

112
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,449
thinking that you'd leaked that story to me,

113
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:44,289
which was not true.

114
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,610
No, I don't know where Mick got it from.

115
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,270
I thought it must've been,

116
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,050
you know,

117
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,729
someone obviously in the industry

118
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,389
that, that spoke to him about it,

119
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:53,689
but yeah,

120
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,689
they called me Ricky leaks,

121
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,229
but to be honest,

122
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,430
it worked in our favor in the end

123
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,530
because that campaign sort of took off

124
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,889
from there and it ended up being

125
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,229
the PR headline.

126
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,189
And I think from memory,

127
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,069
when we go back,

128
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,750
we actually brought Victoria Bitter

129
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,310
back for the first time on Triple M

130
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,750
at like 6,

131
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,210
7 a.m.

132
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,669
in the morning.

133
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:14,969
Which is what I love about,

134
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,490
you know,

135
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,730
you and I spoke in the intro

136
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,670
about your innovation

137
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,069
is that you saw an opportunity

138
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,970
straight away and thought,

139
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,209
well,

140
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,810
this is a story that's happened.

141
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,290
You end up sponsoring the show

142
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,009
straight away.

143
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,490
We hold a VB,

144
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,389
we built a VB fountain,

145
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:27,910
you know,

146
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:28,829
in Mick's honor.

147
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,009
And it was as authentic a story

148
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:31,350
as you could.

149
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,649
No one loved Victoria Bitter

150
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,189
more than Mick Malloy.

151
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,069
It was a sort of DNA of our show,

152
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,029
but you know,

153
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,209
the old sort of marketing world

154
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:38,769
would have been,

155
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,490
that's a drama,

156
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,449
stay away from it.

157
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,509
But your instinct was,

158
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,569
hey, this is good.

159
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:43,089
We need to,

160
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:43,189
we need to,

161
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,910
need to follow it through.

162
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:44,970
Yeah,

163
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,790
because Triple M,

164
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,930
they were,

165
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,110
it was so big at the time

166
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,310
and we just thought Mick

167
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,670
was perfect for VB.

168
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,689
He just loves his beer.

169
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,589
He's genuine.

170
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,370
It was authentic.

171
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,670
And so we thought,

172
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,589
let's run with this.

173
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,629
And so we actually got Mick

174
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,889
and I remember Ed came down

175
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,050
as well to the brewery

176
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,629
and they saw Victoria Bitter 4.9

177
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,769
coming off for the very first time.

178
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,829
And then I think we were upstairs

179
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,689
at the motel.

180
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,670
Because I remember

181
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,970
having the headphones there

182
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,589
with yourself

183
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,009
and,

184
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:13,949
and Mick and Ed

185
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,730
and it was packed

186
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,689
and we had like,

187
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,329
I think a lot of people

188
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,769
must have had the day off

189
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,209
that day on that Monday

190
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:21,990
when we relaunched VB

191
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,970
back to 4.9.

192
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,949
And I think we went on

193
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,990
to sponsor some

194
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,970
Bunga Bunga parties

195
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,110
which Mick was obsessed

196
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,310
with Silvio Berlusconi

197
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,730
at the time.

198
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,069
I look back and think,

199
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,470
you know,

200
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,810
you'd be taken off air

201
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,990
for some of the things

202
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,009
that we did back then.

203
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,290
You'd probably be cancelled

204
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,209
but it was a different time.

205
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:37,990
It was a lot of fun.

206
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,269
All done in good spirit

207
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:41,110
and I think the authentic message

208
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,189
was right.

209
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:42,529
I mean,

210
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,189
the story was that VB

211
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,329
for tax reasons

212
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,750
lowered its alcohol rate

213
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,050
and then the consumers

214
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,790
got it, didn't they?

215
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,029
They went,

216
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,910
hey, you know what?

217
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,889
We're not going to save tax.

218
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,790
We're going to bring the beer

219
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,810
back to what it was.

220
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,170
And again,

221
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,850
that's your marketing hat on.

222
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,930
It was a good campaign.

223
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,769
Yeah, I think that was

224
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,910
one of the lessons I've had

225
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,850
actually over the years

226
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,810
in marketing

227
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,430
is one of our principles

228
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,350
at AB InBev

229
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,750
is the consumer

230
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,470
is the boss.

231
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,509
And when you make decisions

232
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,250
when you're not putting

233
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,269
the consumer first

234
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,470
and you're trying to make

235
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,069
more money in the short term,

236
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:12,509
which is,

237
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:13,129
what we were doing

238
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:13,649
essentially,

239
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,149
I think back in the day

240
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:15,769
was sort of making

241
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,389
an extra $20 million a year

242
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,550
by dropping the ABV

243
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,910
because of the excise tax

244
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,949
and actually gave an excuse

245
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,149
for people to walk away

246
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,170
from Victoria Bitter.

247
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,750
So we wanted to take

248
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,629
that excuse away

249
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:28,410
and we went back

250
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,230
to the big cold beer

251
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,889
and people did flock back.

252
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,050
We actually got VB

253
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,170
back into growth there

254
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,269
for the next 18 months,

255
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,029
which was great.

256
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,910
And, you know,

257
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,250
it was great just to see VB,

258
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,569
you know,

259
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,649
get back to its best.

260
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:40,589
Yeah, I love that.

261
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,949
I mean,

262
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:41,870
you can hear that slogan,

263
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,209
isn't it?

264
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:42,350
You know,

265
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,250
consumer first,

266
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,110
but when you actually

267
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,870
put it in place,

268
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,089
the customers are smart enough

269
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:47,790
to work that out,

270
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:48,129
aren't they?

271
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,430
And say,

272
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,649
okay,

273
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,589
we're going to give up

274
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:50,930
a big financial saving

275
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,750
because we are,

276
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,389
you know,

277
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:53,089
putting you first.

278
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,290
Now,

279
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,930
I've got to jump,

280
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,149
Rich,

281
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,629
because to the next story,

282
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,250
how much of it you can share

283
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,930
will be interesting.

284
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,529
We had one of the great trips

285
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,129
I've ever done.

286
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,149
On the back of that,

287
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:02,730
we ended up going

288
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,769
to the Super Bowl in New York,

289
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,689
February 2014,

290
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,709
MetLife Stadium,

291
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,730
one of the great sporting events

292
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,990
I've ever been to in my life.

293
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,290
And, you know,

294
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:11,870
Eddie, again,

295
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,829
probably planned the trip,

296
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,810
but always got too busy

297
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,449
and couldn't go.

298
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,629
So it was you,

299
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:15,910
Mick,

300
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,009
and I,

301
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,629
and lots of fun over there.

302
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,649
But that probably spawned

303
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,709
another great story,

304
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:22,050
really,

305
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,029
sitting around at the bar,

306
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,170
enjoying a couple of cold beverages

307
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,550
and Mick pitching to you

308
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,750
the idea of a show

309
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,509
called The Front Bar,

310
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,529
which has really changed

311
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,110
the game here in Australia

312
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,170
on the back of that conversation.

313
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:35,910
You know what?

314
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,149
I sort of reflect now

315
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,550
on my time in the beer industry

316
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,850
in 20-odd years ago.

317
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,529
And they were some

318
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,709
of the best times I ever had.

319
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,089
That trip to New York,

320
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,810
I mean, I've been lucky

321
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,310
to go on a number

322
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,370
of Super Bowl trips

323
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,329
and World Cup trips,

324
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,709
but that one with you

325
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,529
and Mick was up there

326
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,490
with one of the best.

327
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,629
Mick, absolute ripper,

328
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,750
and it was a lot of fun.

329
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,490
And, yeah, you're right, actually.

330
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,870
One of the nights

331
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,629
we were just talking

332
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,149
about Carlton Draft,

333
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,209
and he was talking

334
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:05,810
about marketing

335
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,490
and what's the brand about.

336
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,410
And I was just explaining

337
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,769
it was the beer

338
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,470
that mates drink

339
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:11,850
at the bar.

340
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,750
You know, when they're

341
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,290
not taking themselves

342
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,990
too seriously,

343
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,850
you know, it's the beer

344
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,230
that was like

345
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,670
the egalitarian beer.

346
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,269
And the beer you drink

347
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:20,709
at the pub

348
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,790
when you're watching the footy

349
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,470
and you want to have some fun.

350
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,329
And then he spoke to me

351
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,310
about this idea

352
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,610
about a footy show

353
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,389
type concept.

354
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,689
And he said,

355
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,350
you know, could you imagine

356
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,409
like me and another comedian

357
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,210
and an anchor,

358
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,549
you know, at the bar

359
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,110
as mates, you know,

360
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,289
talking about footy

361
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,289
and having fun

362
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,590
and having a few beers.

363
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,570
I'm like, yeah,

364
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:41,850
that's exactly what I'm doing.

365
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,269
That's exactly what

366
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,509
Carlton Draft is about.

367
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:44,970
And I was like,

368
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,210
that's a great idea, Mick.

369
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,330
And we had a few more drinks

370
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,389
and then the stories

371
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:50,169
started getting better

372
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,470
and better as they do.

373
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,370
And then I remember saying to Mick,

374
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:54,149
let's make sure

375
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:55,250
we pick that up again.

376
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,090
And I wasn't sure

377
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,330
if it was just, you know,

378
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,330
Mick had a couple of beers

379
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,909
and telling a few stories.

380
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,210
But to his credit,

381
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,429
the first week

382
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,970
we got back to Melbourne,

383
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,870
he came and formally pitched it.

384
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,990
And there was like

385
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,769
Aidy Brown, I think,

386
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:10,649
was with him at the time

387
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,149
and his brother,

388
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,850
Rich Malloy.

389
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,029
And it was one of those ones

390
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,250
where I thought at the time,

391
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,470
let's have a go.

392
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,110
You know, let's have a crack.

393
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,110
It wasn't a big investment.

394
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,190
And we first of all

395
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,549
kicked it off at the All Nations.

396
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,190
And I remember back in the day

397
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,049
we were looking,

398
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,129
okay, which channel

399
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,210
do we put it on?

400
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,129
And I spoke to,

401
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,289
I won't use his name

402
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,149
because everyone knows him,

403
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,950
but a good friend,

404
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,370
a friend at Channel 10.

405
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:40,929
And I said,

406
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:41,850
we've got this great idea.

407
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,190
Mick's idea with Rich Malloy.

408
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,730
It's called Front Bar.

409
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,750
Took him through the idea.

410
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,250
I reckon it can take down

411
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,710
the Channel 9 footy show.

412
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,149
And he laughed at me,

413
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,289
like literally laughed at me.

414
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,889
He said, you are kidding yourself.

415
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,190
You know, good luck.

416
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,490
So we ended up putting it on

417
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,049
afl.com.au on digital.

418
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,309
And then from there,

419
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,669
it grew to Seven Mate.

420
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,210
I think it was late on a Friday night

421
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,389
before eventually we got onto

422
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,070
the main station Thursday night.

423
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,409
And yeah, the rest is history.

424
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,850
And I love that.

425
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,169
I love that show.

426
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,129
I still watch it,

427
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,850
still stay in touch with the boys.

428
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,909
And when I look back in my time,

429
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,889
that's one of the best things

430
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,110
I've been involved in.

431
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,210
And it was Mick's idea,

432
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,029
Mick's genius.

433
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:24,990
And I think for Carlton Draft,

434
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,850
it was such an authentic partnership,

435
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,429
which I think is why it works so well.

436
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,669
Yeah, for those who are listening

437
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:31,509
and maybe don't understand

438
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,529
the Front Bar,

439
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,629
getting players back,

440
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,789
legends who can tell great stories.

441
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,149
And the brilliant,

442
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,769
it feels like you're sitting at the pub

443
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,830
with three blokes,

444
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,250
you want to have a beer with,

445
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,330
telling great story.

446
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,649
I mean, the concept is so brilliantly simple,

447
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,750
but the show, you know,

448
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,190
is just outstanding.

449
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:50,990
And credit to you, you know,

450
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,370
to back it in ahead of its time

451
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,350
when the TV stations

452
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,129
weren't really prepared to go near it,

453
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,330
to put it on the internet first.

454
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,570
And it's still, you know,

455
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,450
Mick and Andy Marr and Sam Payne do it.

456
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,070
And as a guest to go on that show,

457
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,090
it's a show you want to go on

458
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,149
because you just,

459
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,570
you can't help but laugh.

460
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:07,909
I think everyone goes on

461
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,169
and has a great experience.

462
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,870
I do have to tell one story

463
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,610
from that trip,

464
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,889
but we do promote

465
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,870
responsible service of alcohol.

466
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,970
I know you're in the business of doing that,

467
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,769
but we used to love being in New York

468
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,429
because instead of getting up 6am

469
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,610
to do breakfast radio,

470
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,929
it's one o'clock,

471
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,029
maybe New York time,

472
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,789
12 or one o'clock.

473
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,110
So you can have a couple

474
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,490
of quiet beverages, Rich,

475
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,049
and you can turn up the next day

476
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,330
and do your job

477
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,549
and have a bit of a life.

478
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,009
Breakfast radio can, you know,

479
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,629
can take away the joy of your life.

480
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,049
But Mick had decided to kick on

481
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,090
one of those nights, mate.

482
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,330
And,

483
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,629
and maybe a little later

484
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:45,049
than you and I had decided.

485
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,250
And our guest in studio

486
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,289
was John Butler

487
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,409
from the John Butler Trail,

488
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,970
legendary Australian rocker.

489
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,429
They go pretty hard.

490
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,149
I'll never forget this comment.

491
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:54,710
So Mick,

492
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,350
it may become a little bit later,

493
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,450
turned up late to our show,

494
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,710
even though it was starting at one o'clock.

495
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,409
And John Butler walks into you and I

496
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:01,830
and says,

497
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,049
I think you've got to send your boy home.

498
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,549
I don't think he's good enough to go on air.

499
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:06,990
And I'm thinking,

500
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,370
if you've got a rock star

501
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,629
telling your on-air host to go home,

502
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,169
you know,

503
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,029
you've had a good time in New York.

504
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,870
I'll maybe leave that at that.

505
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,429
Hey Rich,

506
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,169
great success you had at,

507
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,669
at CUB

508
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:21,870
and some of those stories with the front bar

509
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,070
and bringing back VB.

510
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,110
There's many more of those

511
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,350
that make up your success.

512
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,629
CUB gets bought by this global behemoth,

513
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:28,870
AB InBev,

514
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,169
the Budweiser Brewery.

515
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,289
For those who don't know the,

516
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,470
the backstory of that business,

517
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,730
majority owned by Jorge Lehmann,

518
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,110
the,

519
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,590
the genius Brazilian private equity

520
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,669
superstar,

521
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:40,970
man,

522
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,190
that Warren Buffett describes

523
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,649
as one of the best investors

524
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,809
and he reveres him

525
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:45,870
for his investment skills

526
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,809
and they have a reputation rich

527
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,049
for finding young guns in business

528
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,990
and promoting them regardless of age

529
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,289
to senior leadership roles.

530
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,509
And that's exactly your story

531
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,230
as I understand it.

532
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,029
Can you tell us about the culture

533
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,009
that you walked into

534
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,269
taking on this huge global role

535
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:03,389
and what that's been like for you?

536
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,429
I really feel fortunate

537
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,409
the career that I've had

538
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,009
and had,

539
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:10,950
as we sort of say,

540
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,590
sort of touched on.

541
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,529
I've got so many fond memories

542
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,909
from the CUB days.

543
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,590
And then in 2011,

544
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,009
we were acquired by the second biggest brewery

545
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:20,450
in the world,

546
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,649
which was SAB Miller,

547
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,909
a South African brewery.

548
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,750
And that was a great company as well.

549
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,929
And they were people that were passionate about beer,

550
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,870
loved their beer,

551
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,750
but was very much more old school.

552
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,230
And I was part of the global

553
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,289
sort of marketing leadership team there

554
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,669
representing Australia.

555
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,470
But I was by far the youngest

556
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,129
on that leadership team.

557
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,669
So I remember going to those meetings

558
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,049
and I felt really young,

559
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,409
which was always a little bit intimidating.

560
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,830
And then in 2016,

561
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,490
we were acquired by AB InBev

562
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,889
and my remit was being APAC South.

563
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,370
So as well as running marketing for Australia,

564
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,250
I also looked after India and Vietnam.

565
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,129
And I was sitting on the global marketing leadership team

566
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,129
and I've gone from by far the youngest

567
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,950
to one of the oldest,

568
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,049
and it was incredible.

569
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,870
So what age are you there,

570
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,750
like at that stage,

571
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,070
in your late thirties or?

572
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,190
Yeah, so that would have been,

573
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,850
I would have been 36.

574
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,830
And you're on a global business that scale,

575
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:28,250
the biggest consumer goods company in the world.

576
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,730
You're one of the oldest in the leadership position.

577
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,269
One of the oldest.

578
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:32,850
So they're all around my age.

579
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,549
And I really felt at home amongst this group.

580
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,789
They were young, dynamic,

581
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,009
there's a lot of energy in the room.

582
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,710
And one thing that we talk about AB InBev is meritocracy.

583
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,690
So it's actually not about how old you are.

584
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,250
It's about what you deliver, your potential.

585
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,990
And if you dream big and you deliver big results,

586
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,049
you get rewarded.

587
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,090
And that's what I love about the company.

588
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,370
And it's got a very powerful culture.

589
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,210
It's this culture of ownership

590
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:10,710
and everyone,

591
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,850
everyone really acts like they're a genuine owner of the business.

592
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,370
And it's got a very clear purpose.

593
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,289
And that is to dream big,

594
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,149
to create a future with more cheers.

595
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,490
And everyone there dreams big.

596
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,429
And you really can create a future with more cheers,

597
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,210
a future with more happiness,

598
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,009
with more celebration,

599
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,970
more innovation,

600
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,909
more sustainability.

601
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,350
And the best way for me to describe AB InBev,

602
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,210
it's like it's one of the biggest CPGs in the world,

603
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,409
but it has a mindset of a startup.

604
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,649
You know, we really move at speed with agility

605
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,889
and we try and minimize the bureaucracy that you get in big organizations.

606
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:52,590
So, yeah, I feel like, you know, I found my home when I became part of ABI.

607
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,710
Yeah. And the backstory again, you know,

608
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,690
you know, the story of the genius three musketeers from Brazil.

609
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,269
They, you know, bought some of the biggest brands in the world,

610
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,649
you know, Heinz in America, Burger King,

611
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,129
and then, you know, the famous Budweiser.

612
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,470
So that's dreaming big, isn't it?

613
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,250
And you feel like,

614
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,389
that culture genuinely flows through to day-to-day in your job and what you do.

615
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,490
Yeah. Even now, those people that had the chance to read Dream Big, the book,

616
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,350
it's incredible.

617
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:26,370
The fact that, you know, the three that you talk about that sort of founded the business

618
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,909
in the early days, a small Brazilian brewer that bought Antarctica and became a big brewer

619
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:36,990
in Brazil, that then went on and bought Interbrew, you know, think of the likes of Stella Artois,

620
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,389
and then went and bought Grippo Medello, like Corona,

621
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,470
and then when no one thought that they could, they went and bought Anheuser-Busch,

622
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:52,230
which is really, you know, Budweiser in the US, and all the way to buying the second biggest

623
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,509
brewer in the world, SAB Miller.

624
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,169
I mean, you talk about dreaming big, it doesn't get bigger than that.

625
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,389
So it's something that they live and breathe in the culture.

626
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:10,430
You feel it, you get caught up in it, and it's incredibly motivating to know you've got a company that will dream big,

627
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,509
and will aggressively go after it.

628
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:16,150
We're sitting in Melbourne today, Rich, the World Cup.

629
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:24,589
Our time was played last night, the World Cup final, Argentina beat France in one of the great World Cups of all time,

630
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:29,589
and Lionel Messi becomes arguably in the conversation for the greatest players of all time.

631
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:35,630
But for you, a couple of days out, Budweiser, synonymous with the World Cup, you're a major sponsor.

632
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,509
You have beer banned from the stadiums literally a few days out.

633
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,190
Tell us about...

634
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:56,829
Yeah, it's fair to say we had a pretty intense month with Budweiser, and, you know, we've had a team working on this for 18 months to two years,

635
00:17:56,829 --> 00:18:00,349
you know, and for some people it's been like full time.

636
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:09,509
So you can imagine the emotions when we get the phone call to let us know that they're banning Budweiser in the stadiums.

637
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:16,069
And so we went straight into scenario planning and sort of working from, you know,

638
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:20,549
there's obviously the more emotional response was let's pull out, you know,

639
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:29,750
we've got 1600 people that were coming over that were part of the AB InBev family with customers and wholesalers and celebrities and influencers.

640
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:37,509
We took over the Budweiser, the W Hotel became the Budweiser Hotel, which was the best hotel in Doha.

641
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,509
They had the best nightclub in Doha.

642
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,670
Which became the Bud Club.

643
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,029
So we were all geared up for this big activation.

644
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:51,509
So to have that pulled from us sort of a week out was a big challenge, big obstacle.

645
00:18:51,509 --> 00:19:01,269
And so as we were working through it, obviously the time difference, we had a team in the UK because they're on the same time, similar time to Qatar.

646
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:09,349
One of our talents in our team who runs our newsroom thought that they would capitalize on this moment and went out with Well.com.

647
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,190
That's awkward.

648
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,630
And before you know it, it's blown up and it's gone viral.

649
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,829
And so...

650
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,670
Can I ask you before you move on to that?

651
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,910
Someone in power in your team.

652
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,150
Yeah.

653
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,869
That's a pretty big call on the Budweiser social media account.

654
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,509
Does the bureaucracy have to get approval for that?

655
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,509
Or did someone just go with gut feel and go?

656
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,109
So it's a good question.

657
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:38,549
We have our protocols and when it is linked to sort of banning

658
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,210
alcohol, something as sensitive as this, it should have been escalated

659
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,009
but unfortunately time differences and us being asleep

660
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,369
when it started to leak in the newsroom

661
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:55,089
she thought she'd do the right thing as an owner and to be honest

662
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:59,269
when you think about it in hindsight, she knows the platform incredibly well

663
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,269
and the tone was spot on

664
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,230
at the time. It was brilliant but it probably should have been

665
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,349
escalated and so people that know the story will know we actually pulled it

666
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:14,150
down. I woke up in the morning and had like 100 text messages

667
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,470
the head of Budweiser globally, the VP rang me and said look we're going to have to

668
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,890
work through this, this has just gone out and

669
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,269
I was really impressed with the way that the team handled it

670
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,869
like the head of legal, just very professional, pragmatic

671
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:35,049
always thinking the bigger picture, always like what are our principles

672
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,930
how are we going to handle this

673
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,430
and we spoke to the person at the time and

674
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,809
she took it very well and understood that that one probably should have been escalated

675
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,390
so we pulled it down and that actually created even more intrigue

676
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,009
into why we pulled it down and understanding the sensitivity

677
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,849
of this was we had a lot of people on the ground in Qatar so you have to always

678
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:01,529
put your people first and be careful that you don't ever put them in danger

679
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:06,309
and also we were very conscious that we are at late stages

680
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,930
and we had a negotiation with FIFA for the 2026 contract

681
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,529
which is North America so it's Mexico, Canada, US, very important

682
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,130
that we wanted to get so we didn't want to do anything that was going to potentially damage

683
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,950
that negotiation so it was a very tense time

684
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,069
but we all got together as a team and we thought how do we

685
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,930
turn these lemons that we've been dealt into lemonade and so we

686
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,430
called it Project Lemonade and we

687
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,829
we decided that people

688
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,809
the players can play for more than just the World Cup

689
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,710
they can play for the beer and so we went out the next day with the tweet

690
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,990
new day, new tweet, winner takes all, bring home the bud

691
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,329
So within 24 hours you've moved to

692
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:57,230
that campaign, for a decision that big that's pretty quick

693
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,210
and that's one of the reasons I just love the company so much

694
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,009
the speed that we moved at, you have the 4 or 5 decision makers

695
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,789
in the room across marketing

696
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:11,509
PR, legal and said this is the call we're going to make

697
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,450
and we're going to, we don't know exactly how it's going to happen

698
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,630
we don't know which country is going to win, is it 100% feasible

699
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,769
but we're going to make it happen, we're going to work it out

700
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,390
so we were cheering, I was cheering last night for Argentina

701
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,910
because they know how to party, they know how to have fun

702
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,769
and to see Lionel Messi win

703
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,609
was historic, one of the best games ever and so

704
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:39,369
Messi's going to bring home the bud with Argentina

705
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,390
and we're going to put on one of the biggest celebrations ever in Buenos Aires

706
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,569
So literally you're going to fly in all of that unused stock

707
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,230
and the image is great isn't it, and have a party for the winner

708
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,630
and winner takes all was the message

709
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,309
It was like everywhere, the hashtag bring home the bud sort of took off

710
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,230
we had containers, they were Budweiser containers

711
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,289
saying bring home the bud, we're dropping in cities all around the world

712
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:05,529
Brazil got a bit excited, they thought they were going to bring home the bud

713
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,809
and they had dropped them in all of them

714
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,829
in all of their cities

715
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,829
and so then the consumers started getting behind it which was great

716
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,829
and then Neymar posted saying he wants to bring home the bud for Brazil

717
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,829
so it really started to build up and get a lot of traction

718
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:24,829
and yes, Argentina are the ones that are going to enjoy the celebration

719
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:27,829
and it's going to be a great party

720
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,829
You'd like to be on the ground in Argentina today

721
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,829
that would be some serious fun

722
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:36,829
Now Rich, I know you've had a huge passion for leadership in a senior, senior role

723
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,829
all the way through from a young age

724
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,829
and a huge sense of having a positive impact in your leadership

725
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:45,829
and we're really grateful you joined our space, A Leader Connect

726
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:50,829
Matt and I, my great mate who's actually sitting outside the studio today

727
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,829
we're going to have some lunch after this

728
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,829
and it's been awesome to connect with you again

729
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,829
and see what you've brought to the table

730
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:00,829
but hopefully as well, it's a group that we love

731
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,829
it's a really fascinating group

732
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,829
Benjamin Northey who's the CEO of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra

733
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,829
one of the most revered conductors around the world

734
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:09,829
and I just love sitting across from him in the same format here Rich

735
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,829
and what a brilliant, creative brain

736
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,829
Michael Voss, you're a gun junior footy player Rich

737
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,829
you nearly went down the AFL path

738
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:17,829
Michael Voss, one of the best players ever

739
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,829
and a unique person in that world

740
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:22,829
Dr Chris Brown, just a genius

741
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,829
Chris, incredible person in his place

742
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:25,829
Trent Robinson, legend of NRL

743
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,829
and a lovely guy and love the way he goes about

744
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,829
can you tell us about what it's been like catching up

745
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,829
and connecting in that world of A Leader Connect?

746
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:36,829
It was an honour

747
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,829
just to be part of that group

748
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:39,829
to be honest

749
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:43,829
because Voss, the first promotion I ever did in my marketing career

750
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,829
was on Carlton Meade in 2001 with Michael Voss

751
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:47,829
Really?

752
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,829
Yeah, so that brought back memories

753
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,829
That was their first premiership wasn't it?

754
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:52,829
Yeah, they won three in a row

755
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,829
Three in a row then

756
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:54,829
around then

757
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,829
so it was great timing

758
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,829
and really good bunch of guys

759
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:04,829
who have been incredibly successful in their own fields

760
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:05,829
and I love the sessions

761
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:10,829
they go for an hour and 15 Matt puts in the diary

762
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:12,829
but it's one I always prioritise

763
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:14,829
because I really enjoy it

764
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:16,829
and they go so quickly

765
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,829
like it's like, it's already up

766
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:20,829
it's one of the quickest meetings you have for the week

767
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:23,829
and everyone has a different perspective

768
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:26,829
and so we do talk about

769
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:30,829
you know, leadership and challenges that we're facing

770
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,829
and it's been really fascinating

771
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:34,829
people will bring to the table

772
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:37,829
a challenge that they're facing

773
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,829
and then you get different perspectives on

774
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,829
you know, how you could handle it

775
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:44,829
and it's about the questions that you ask

776
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:46,829
and I remember vividly

777
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,829
probably the third session we had

778
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,829
Trent Robinson who's the coach of the Roosters

779
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:54,829
and he's a very impressive guy

780
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,829
and he was talking about one of the challenges he had

781
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,829
leading into the finals

782
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:03,829
and it was just one question that Vossie asked him

783
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,829
that got him to think differently

784
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,829
about his plan

785
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:08,829
and I won't give it away obviously

786
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:10,829
because it's always confidential those conversations

787
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:11,829
but Robbo was like

788
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:13,829
hey Vossie, I hadn't thought of it like that

789
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:16,829
you know, and it's just like a different perspective

790
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:18,829
the right question being asked

791
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:19,829
to get you to think differently

792
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,829
and so it's been incredibly valuable

793
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,829
and one that, you know

794
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,829
we've finished the sessions

795
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:26,829
but we love it so much

796
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:27,829
we're continuing with it

797
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:28,829
Yeah, it's great Rich

798
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,829
and I love that idea, isn't it

799
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:30,829
you've got brilliant people

800
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,829
and you know, you're running at it

801
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,829
running at an incredible, you know, schedule

802
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,829
every time I see you're in Colombia or

803
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,829
somewhere in a different market

804
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,829
you know, running global brands

805
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,829
but the fact that you take that time to dial the other 15

806
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:44,829
Chris Brown was telling me he was in Iceland

807
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,829
in the back of a Kombi van

808
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:47,829
3 o'clock in the morning

809
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:49,829
dialing in to make sure he didn't miss

810
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,829
and you know, he described that

811
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:53,829
as wanting to be a better person after those sessions

812
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:57,829
that's someone at an incredibly high level

813
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,829
and so, you know, it's fascinating that you guys take the time

814
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:00,829
but it feels like

815
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:01,829
you don't know what you don't know do you?

816
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,829
when someone comes from a different world

817
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:04,829
there's some real value

818
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,829
when having that shared opinion, isn't there?

819
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:07,829
There is

820
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,829
and I think with those sessions

821
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:10,829
I find that

822
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,829
the more open you are

823
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,829
the more vulnerable you are

824
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,829
the more you get out of it

825
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:17,829
it's almost become

826
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,829
it's like a personal board

827
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:20,829
or

828
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,829
for me it's like a little mentor group

829
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,829
because it's good to talk about people

830
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:28,829
to people that are not connected with your work

831
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:29,829
and

832
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:31,829
I haven't even met these guys

833
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:32,829
face to face

834
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,829
because I'm on the other side of the world

835
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:35,829
but

836
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,829
we just have this implicit trust

837
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,829
amongst the group

838
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,829
where we throw things out there

839
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:41,829
that we open ourselves up

840
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,829
and I think that's what

841
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,829
has sort of galvanized the group

842
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:46,829
and

843
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:48,829
you know, we get so much out of it

844
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:49,829
and so I think these will be like

845
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,829
hopefully it's sort of mentors that

846
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,829
I can continue to stay in touch with

847
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:54,829
for quite some time

848
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:55,829
and you know

849
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:57,829
if I have problems going forward

850
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,829
you know, these are guys that I'll reach out to

851
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,829
and to get their point of view

852
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,829
because they come at it from a different angle

853
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:05,829
I hear there's an inter-season trip

854
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:06,829
being planned in New York mate

855
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:07,829
your new home town

856
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,829
and I've got no right to be there

857
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:10,829
but I'm planning on being there

858
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,829
come along Rich mate

859
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,829
I've enjoyed some time

860
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:15,829
in that part of the world with you

861
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,829
and again

862
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:17,829
you know, we often say

863
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,829
we love collaborating with people from

864
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,829
you know, small business or

865
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,829
people working in education or the arts

866
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:25,829
you don't have to

867
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,829
you know, be the global head of marketing

868
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:28,829
to be part of one of these groups

869
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,829
we love meeting people where they're at and

870
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:31,829
they're great stories

871
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:32,829
people as busy as Rich

872
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,829
to take the time to reflect and learn

873
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:35,829
so again, I'll give it a plug

874
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:38,829
if you want to check out elitacollective.com

875
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:39,829
and our signature program

876
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:40,829
that Rich is just talking about

877
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:42,829
it's called Elita Connect

878
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,829
now there's a famous quote Rich

879
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:45,829
that you know well

880
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:46,829
from your world

881
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:48,829
half the money I spend on advertising is wasted

882
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,829
the trouble is I don't know which half

883
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,829
it's attributed to John Wanamaker

884
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,829
it's almost a hundred years ago I think

885
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:55,829
or even longer

886
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,829
known as the forefather of marketing

887
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,829
he was a successful merchant in the US

888
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:01,829
from what I understand

889
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:03,829
can I pick your brain on this for a moment

890
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,829
a lot of people listening

891
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:06,829
who started a business

892
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,829
or want to grow their space

893
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,829
in whatever field it is

894
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:10,829
I mean it's a hard question but

895
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,829
what's the key in your mind

896
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:13,829
from all your experience in marketing

897
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,829
what's some lessons we can learn from you

898
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,829
it's a big question

899
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:20,829
and I think

900
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,829
in regard to that quote

901
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,829
more and more

902
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,829
you can measure these days

903
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,829
you know, particularly through digital

904
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:28,829
so you know

905
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:30,829
you can see what your cost per acquisition is

906
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,829
you can see what your ROI is

907
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:34,829
so these days

908
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:36,829
it's much easier to be able to sort of justify

909
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,829
the extra spend on marketing

910
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:40,829
being able to see the impact that it has

911
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:42,829
on building brand equity

912
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,829
and then ultimately

913
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,829
how it drives conversion

914
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,829
and so most people understand the funnel

915
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,829
from awareness to consideration

916
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,829
to conversion

917
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,829
so we track all of that

918
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,829
and that's why sort of

919
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:57,829
it's not as fluffy these days

920
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:58,829
as what it might be

921
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,829
it might have been back then

922
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,829
but I mean from a marketing perspective

923
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:04,829
you know, I think the big thing is

924
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,829
most people that are looking to start their business

925
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:08,829
or start a brand

926
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:11,829
is to think about

927
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:14,829
how are you going to differentiate your brand

928
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:16,829
you know, in that field

929
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:17,829
and then think about

930
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:18,829
functionally

931
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,829
how is it differentiated

932
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:21,829
and then emotionally

933
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:23,829
how do you differentiate it

934
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,829
because what I see is a lot of

935
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,829
direct to consumer brands

936
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,829
that are quite transactional

937
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,829
so they're more around product

938
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,829
and price

939
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,829
and they drive very much about conversion

940
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,829
they don't do as good a job

941
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,829
as sort of building a brand

942
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:40,829
building the emotion behind the brand

943
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:42,829
building distinctive assets

944
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:44,829
that make the brand stand out

945
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:46,829
so distinctive asset is like

946
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:47,829
it could be the logo

947
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:48,829
it could be the colour

948
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:49,829
it could be the shape

949
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:51,829
think of the VB bottle

950
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:53,829
think the VB jingle

951
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,829
these are distinctive assets

952
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:56,829
that are incredibly important

953
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:57,829
when you're building a brand

954
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:58,829
and then

955
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,829
it really then comes down to

956
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,829
if I really make it simple

957
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,829
is physical availability

958
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,829
and mental availability

959
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:08,829
so physical availability

960
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:10,829
if you can't find that product

961
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:11,829
that brand

962
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:12,829
you can't buy it

963
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,829
and so it sounds simple

964
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,829
but it's the most important thing

965
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:17,829
and then at the same time

966
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:18,829
mental availability

967
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,829
when people are open

968
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:23,829
to buying that product

969
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:24,829
you need to make sure

970
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:25,829
your brand's top of mind

971
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:26,829
and that's why

972
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,829
you need strong distinctive assets

973
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:29,829
and you need to make sure

974
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,829
that your brand is going to cut through

975
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:33,829
so that

976
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,829
and people sometimes don't think about this

977
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,829
but even if I look at beer brands

978
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,829
when you hold that beer brand in your hand

979
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:42,829
it says something about you

980
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,829
it's like a badge

981
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:45,829
and that's all the meaning

982
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:47,829
that you build behind that brand

983
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:48,829
that's so important

984
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:52,829
yeah it's a really great explanation

985
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,829
I'm not surprised in any way shape or form

986
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,829
I'm still wrestling with

987
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:57,829
the intuition part as well

988
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,829
clearly you can measure the digital

989
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:00,829
more than ever

990
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:01,829
but there's an intuition to say

991
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:02,829
bring back the bud

992
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:03,829
isn't it in 24 hours

993
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,829
that you can't mistake

994
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,829
I suppose those decisions

995
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,829
are part of your history

996
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:10,829
and your skill

997
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:11,829
that you bring to the table

998
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,829
I read in research for this Rich

999
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:14,829
that I didn't realise

1000
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:15,829
the Chinese market

1001
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:16,829
is the biggest beer market

1002
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:17,829
for ABM beer

1003
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:18,829
is that correct

1004
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:19,829
by some factor

1005
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:20,829
and that you think

1006
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:21,829
they're the most sophisticated

1007
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,829
in digital marketing

1008
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:24,829
am I right in saying that

1009
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:25,829
and why is that the case

1010
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:27,829
yeah China I think

1011
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:28,829
are ahead of the game

1012
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,829
when it comes to digital

1013
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,829
I'm on WeChat

1014
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,829
I still try to find it hard

1015
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:35,829
to get my head around

1016
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,829
all of their digital platforms

1017
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,829
and even with DTC

1018
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:41,829
within beer

1019
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:42,829
they're well ahead of the game

1020
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,829
DTC explain that

1021
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,829
direct to consumer

1022
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,829
so where you can

1023
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:46,829
order your beer online

1024
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:49,829
and have it delivered to your door

1025
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:50,829
within 30 minutes

1026
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:51,829
is that going to be big

1027
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:52,829
around the world

1028
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:53,829
is that happening in your space

1029
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:54,829
more and more now

1030
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:55,829
it is

1031
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:56,829
happening more and more now

1032
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:59,829
so we have Zed Delivery in Brazil

1033
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:00,829
which is becoming

1034
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:01,829
quite sizeable for us

1035
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:03,829
we think it will get to

1036
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:05,829
10 plus percent

1037
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:06,829
of the beer market

1038
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:07,829
but it's more

1039
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:09,829
once you have that channel

1040
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,829
and you've got everything from

1041
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:12,829
you know when you spend marketing

1042
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:13,829
on that digital channel

1043
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:15,829
you then know what the conversion is

1044
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,829
and then you can get a lot of insights

1045
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,829
and test innovation

1046
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,829
that will help you across

1047
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:21,829
the other 90%

1048
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:22,829
and across the other channels

1049
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:23,829
so we think it's really

1050
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:24,829
going to be important for us

1051
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,829
more the direct to consumer

1052
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:27,829
moving forward

1053
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:28,829
we have a brand called Tadar

1054
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:29,829
which will be our global

1055
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,829
direct to consumer brand

1056
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,829
that we sort of launched

1057
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:34,829
about a year ago

1058
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:35,829
so I'm sitting at home

1059
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:36,829
there's an app

1060
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:38,829
I want a six pack of Budweiser

1061
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:39,829
I can get it delivered

1062
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,829
anywhere around the world

1063
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:42,829
is that where it ends up

1064
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:43,829
exactly right

1065
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:44,829
you'll be

1066
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:45,829
you're on your phone

1067
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:46,829
you'll probably do reorder

1068
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:47,829
get the same sort of six pack

1069
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:48,829
and then

1070
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:49,829
you know we have a commitment

1071
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,829
that you know within 30 minutes

1072
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,829
we'll have it delivered

1073
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:53,829
to your door

1074
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:54,829
cold

1075
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:55,829
so yeah

1076
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:57,829
it's going to be a bit of a game changer

1077
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,829
in many places around the world

1078
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,829
yeah that's a compelling offer

1079
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:01,829
when you think

1080
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:02,829
how

1081
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:03,829
you know

1082
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:04,829
where we've come from

1083
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:05,829
from

1084
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:06,829
you know six o'clock close

1085
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:07,829
here in Melbourne

1086
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:08,829
wasn't that long ago

1087
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,829
was it

1088
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:10,829
you couldn't get a beer anywhere after

1089
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:11,829
that is a huge transformation

1090
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:12,829
isn't it

1091
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:13,829
with that sort of technology

1092
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:14,829
available

1093
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:15,829
going forward

1094
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:16,829
I like asking this question Rich

1095
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:17,829
because

1096
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:18,829
I talk family

1097
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:19,829
you know

1098
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:20,829
with you a lot

1099
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:21,829
because I'm passionate about it

1100
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:22,829
you're living in New York

1101
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:23,829
you've got this incredible global role

1102
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,829
you're on a plane every other day

1103
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,829
it's an incredible

1104
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,829
chapter of your life

1105
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:30,829
but you move Rose and your three kids

1106
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:31,829
to New York as well

1107
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:32,829
and

1108
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:33,829
you're

1109
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:34,829
I know really passionate about the family space

1110
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:35,829
but how do you balance

1111
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,829
doing something as significant

1112
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:38,829
and busy as you are

1113
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:39,829
and keep

1114
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,829
the success going on the family front

1115
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,829
it's a challenge

1116
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:45,829
I think it helps having

1117
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,829
an incredibly supportive wife

1118
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,829
and

1119
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:50,829
Rose has been

1120
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,829
amazing with our move to

1121
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,829
to New York

1122
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:54,829
actually over the years

1123
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:55,829
you know

1124
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:56,829
very supportive

1125
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:57,829
with the three kids

1126
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,829
I try and do my best to

1127
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,829
compartmentalize

1128
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:03,829
when I'm at work

1129
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,829
and when I'm at home

1130
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:06,829
and when I'm at home

1131
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:08,829
I always try and make sure that

1132
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:09,829
I'm present

1133
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:10,829
you know

1134
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,829
that I'm present with the kids

1135
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:12,829
that I'm setting the right example

1136
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:14,829
that I'm not on my phone

1137
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:15,829
and

1138
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:16,829
you know

1139
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:17,829
when I'm at work

1140
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:18,829
you know

1141
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:19,829
I'm pretty intense at work

1142
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:20,829
and so

1143
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:21,829
I try and

1144
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:22,829
break that up

1145
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,829
and

1146
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:24,829
and when I'm at home

1147
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:25,829
you know with the

1148
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:26,829
with the kids

1149
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:27,829
I love watching their sport

1150
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:28,829
so

1151
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:29,829
the weekends are really all about

1152
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:30,829
you know

1153
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,829
Rose and the kids

1154
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:32,829
I go to

1155
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:33,829
all their different sports

1156
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:34,829
you know

1157
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:35,829
sort of running around

1158
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,829
New York City

1159
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:37,829
in the car

1160
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:38,829
from you know

1161
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:39,829
basketball

1162
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:40,829
to

1163
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:41,829
to baseball

1164
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:42,829
to NFL football

1165
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:43,829
and so

1166
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:44,829
it's been quite different

1167
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:45,829
to the Auskick days

1168
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:46,829
that I used to see you at

1169
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:47,829
and then

1170
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,829
and cricket

1171
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:49,829
but

1172
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:50,829
no it's

1173
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:51,829
it is a challenge

1174
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:52,829
one thing I'm very

1175
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:53,829
but I always talk

1176
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:54,829
people go

1177
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:55,829
how do you go with

1178
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,829
work-life balance

1179
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,829
and

1180
00:35:58,829 --> 00:35:59,829
I've always struggled

1181
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:00,829
with that

1182
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:01,829
because work's always been such a big

1183
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,829
part of my life

1184
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:03,829
but I also know that

1185
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,829
family are clearly

1186
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,829
my number one

1187
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:06,829
two and three

1188
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:07,829
priority

1189
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:08,829
but I call it

1190
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:09,829
work-life integration

1191
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:10,829
you know

1192
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:11,829
so how do I

1193
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:12,829
make sure that

1194
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:13,829
you know

1195
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:14,829
I can be the best

1196
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:15,829
I can be at work

1197
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:16,829
and how I can be the best dad

1198
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,829
and the best husband

1199
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:19,829
and

1200
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:20,829
it's a challenge

1201
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:21,829
but I think

1202
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:22,829
the thing I really focus on is

1203
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,829
being always being present there

1204
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:25,829
I've seen you firsthand

1205
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:26,829
at a barbecue mate

1206
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:27,829
you are the king of the kids

1207
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:28,829
you've got

1208
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:29,829
a natural

1209
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:30,829
ability to do that

1210
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:31,829
but yeah

1211
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:32,829
it is interesting

1212
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:33,829
because you don't want to miss the point of life

1213
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:34,829
either do you

1214
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:35,829
you have this great chapter

1215
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:36,829
and

1216
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:37,829
you know

1217
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,829
to have a connected family

1218
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,829
but the upside is

1219
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:40,829
what a unique experience for your kids

1220
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:41,829
you know

1221
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:42,829
they're going to have this incredible

1222
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:43,829
chapter

1223
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:44,829
and I hear they're going beautifully

1224
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:45,829
over there

1225
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,829
Rich we're really passionate about

1226
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,829
what modern leadership looks like

1227
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:50,829
and we feel like there's a real shift

1228
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:51,829
you know

1229
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:52,829
what your company does

1230
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:53,829
is promoting young people

1231
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:54,829
with

1232
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:55,829
as you said

1233
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:56,829
this energy and passion

1234
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:57,829
but we're seeing

1235
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:58,829
that shift away from the old hierarchy

1236
00:36:58,829 --> 00:36:59,829
which you spoke about

1237
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:00,829
you know

1238
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:01,829
where

1239
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:02,829
no matter what

1240
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:03,829
you're going to have to wait your time

1241
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:04,829
and you know

1242
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:05,829
the

1243
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,829
we often use the term

1244
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:07,829
the boss is in the corner office

1245
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:08,829
and it's very hard to even

1246
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,829
get a

1247
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,829
a knock on the door

1248
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:11,829
and we see there's some

1249
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,829
common traits

1250
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:13,829
that we want to talk to you about

1251
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:14,829
starting with self-leadership

1252
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:15,829
we don't think

1253
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:16,829
anyone's really

1254
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:17,829
been able to lead well

1255
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:18,829
without an idea of self-leadership

1256
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:20,829
what does that mean to you

1257
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:21,829
self-leadership

1258
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:22,829
when I think about

1259
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:23,829
leadership

1260
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:24,829
you know

1261
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:25,829
I think about

1262
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:26,829
strong leaders

1263
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:27,829
really care about

1264
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,829
humans

1265
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,829
not employees

1266
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:30,829
and that's

1267
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:31,829
one thing

1268
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:32,829
that's sort of stuck with me

1269
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:33,829
over the years

1270
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:34,829
that people want to feel valued

1271
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:35,829
you know

1272
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:36,829
as a human

1273
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,829
not just another number

1274
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:38,829
in the organization

1275
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:39,829
so really caring about people

1276
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:40,829
having the ability

1277
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:41,829
to have empathy

1278
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:42,829
to be able to

1279
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,829
nurture

1280
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:44,829
those relationships

1281
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,829
and

1282
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:46,829
you know

1283
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:47,829
I think

1284
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:48,829
that's

1285
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:49,829
that's

1286
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:50,829
that's

1287
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:51,829
really important

1288
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:52,829
and when I think about

1289
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:53,829
self-leadership

1290
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:54,829
I don't really

1291
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:55,829
haven't thought too much

1292
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:56,829
about self-leadership

1293
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:57,829
but when I think about it

1294
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:58,829
it's more about

1295
00:37:58,829 --> 00:37:59,829
for you to be able to lead others

1296
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:00,829
and care about others

1297
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:01,829
you need to also be comfortable

1298
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:02,829
with yourself

1299
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:03,829
and

1300
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:04,829
I think

1301
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:05,829
having

1302
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:06,829
being

1303
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,829
physically fit

1304
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:08,829
so that you can

1305
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,829
help

1306
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,829
handle the stresses

1307
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:11,829
and be able to lead others

1308
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:12,829
and be mentally fit

1309
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:13,829
and in a good place

1310
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:14,829
means that you can give more

1311
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:15,829
to other people

1312
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:16,829
and I think

1313
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:17,829
it's really important

1314
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:18,829
and I think

1315
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,829
self-leadership

1316
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,829
is

1317
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:21,829
you know

1318
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:22,829
also links to being

1319
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:23,829
having self-confidence

1320
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:24,829
and I think

1321
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:25,829
it doesn't matter

1322
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:26,829
what role you're in

1323
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:27,829
a senior leader's role

1324
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:28,829
it's tough

1325
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:29,829
you know

1326
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:30,829
you need to have

1327
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:31,829
that self-confidence

1328
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:32,829
you need to have conviction

1329
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:33,829
at the right time

1330
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:34,829
I find particularly

1331
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:35,829
in marketing

1332
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:36,829
because everyone's got an opinion

1333
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:37,829
and

1334
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:38,829
it's always

1335
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:39,829
often polarizing

1336
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:40,829
there's always going to be people

1337
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:41,829
that's going to disagree with you

1338
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:42,829
and

1339
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:43,829
so you need to be able to

1340
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:44,829
listen to people

1341
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:45,829
listen

1342
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:46,829
look at different data points

1343
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:47,829
but then you have to make a call

1344
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:48,829
and you're going to have

1345
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:49,829
the confidence

1346
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,829
to back it in

1347
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,829
and so

1348
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,829
when I think about

1349
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:53,829
self-leadership

1350
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:54,829
I think

1351
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:55,829
having that self-confidence

1352
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:56,829
is critical

1353
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:57,829
and also

1354
00:38:57,829 --> 00:38:58,829
to make sure that

1355
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:59,829
having that self-confidence

1356
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:00,829
that you have

1357
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:01,829
you stick by your values

1358
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:02,829
you know

1359
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:03,829
you stay true to who you are

1360
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:04,829
and sometimes

1361
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:05,829
if the

1362
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:06,829
organization

1363
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,829
doesn't align to your values

1364
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:08,829
then you're in the wrong place

1365
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:09,829
yeah

1366
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:17,159
I know you're really

1367
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,159
passionate about this dimension

1368
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,159
which is

1369
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,159
the positive impact

1370
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,159
in

1371
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,159
the environment

1372
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,159
and

1373
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,159
how you do that on a daily basis

1374
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,159
it's

1375
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,159
all one of your great skills

1376
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,159
you consciously think about it

1377
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,159
can you tell us

1378
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,159
how you've gone about that

1379
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,159
idea of

1380
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,159
positively impacting others

1381
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,159
yeah

1382
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,159
I talk to the team a lot about

1383
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,159
the

1384
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,159
the power of

1385
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,159
positive energy

1386
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,159
I came across this

1387
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,159
presentation

1388
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,159
years ago

1389
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,159
by this lady

1390
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,159
Amanda Gore

1391
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,159
and it really stuck with me

1392
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,159
and she spoke about

1393
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,159
the power of energy

1394
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,159
and

1395
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,159
that you can wake up in the morning

1396
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,159
and you can make a choice

1397
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,159
to either be

1398
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,159
an energy giver

1399
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,159
or an energy sucker

1400
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,159
and

1401
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,159
it's a choice you can make

1402
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,159
they're both as powerful

1403
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,159
as each other

1404
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,159
they're both contagious

1405
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,159
and

1406
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,159
I wake up every morning

1407
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,159
I try and get to the gym

1408
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,159
if I can

1409
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,159
and

1410
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,159
I always

1411
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,159
go to work

1412
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,159
with a positive mindset

1413
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,159
before the kids go to school

1414
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,159
every day

1415
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,159
I say kids

1416
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,159
don't just have a good day

1417
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,159
have a great day

1418
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,159
and they roll their eyes

1419
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,159
every time

1420
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,159
and they're like

1421
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,159
dad we're

1422
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,159
and

1423
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,159
but I know that

1424
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,159
even if 10% of it gets through

1425
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,159
I'll be happy

1426
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,159
that they have a great day

1427
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,159
and when I go to work

1428
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,159
you know

1429
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,159
you

1430
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,159
you don't

1431
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,159
sometimes you underestimate the

1432
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,159
impact you have

1433
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,159
on other people

1434
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,159
and

1435
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,159
when I go into

1436
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,159
a meeting

1437
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,159
you know

1438
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,159
I make the choice

1439
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,159
that I'm gonna

1440
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,159
I wanna have a great meeting

1441
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,159
I wanna greenhouse

1442
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,159
rather than what we call

1443
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,159
shithousing

1444
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,159
and a lot of it's sort of

1445
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,159
body language

1446
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,159
so I'll start a meeting

1447
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,159
with a bit of banter

1448
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,159
a joke

1449
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
have a bit of fun

1450
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,159
tell them I'm excited

1451
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,159
about the meeting

1452
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,159
and then you get the best out of people

1453
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,159
because people are gonna be more

1454
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,159
put their ideas out there

1455
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,159
that you can greenhouse

1456
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,159
and talk about

1457
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,159
whereas if you go into that meeting

1458
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,159
and you're

1459
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,159
grumpy

1460
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,159
you've just had a fight with your

1461
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,159
your wife

1462
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,159
the kids are doing your head in

1463
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,159
and

1464
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,159
you can just suck the energy

1465
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,159
out of that room very quickly

1466
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,159
and be an energy sucker

1467
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,159
and you'll watch your team

1468
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,159
just go into their shell

1469
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,159
and

1470
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,159
it's something that's really stuck with me

1471
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,159
now of course

1472
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,159
there are times

1473
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,159
when there are tough times

1474
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,159
where you have

1475
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,159
always gotta be authentic

1476
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,159
and you have to deliver

1477
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,159
tough messages

1478
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,159
but most of the time

1479
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,159
you can make a choice

1480
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,159
whether you're gonna be

1481
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,159
an energy giver

1482
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,159
or an energy sucker

1483
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,159
and all my life

1484
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,159
I prefer to be

1485
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,159
glass half full

1486
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,159
than glass half empty

1487
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,159
yeah it's a brilliant

1488
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,159
way to think about it

1489
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,159
you know

1490
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,159
my wife Becca

1491
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,159
always talks about

1492
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,159
your energy

1493
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,159
speaks well before you do

1494
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,159
so even before

1495
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,159
as you said

1496
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,159
you've opened your mouth

1497
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,159
like the body language

1498
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,159
and

1499
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,159
a smile

1500
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,159
or

1501
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,159
you can impact people

1502
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,159
massively

1503
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,159
can't you

1504
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,159
as you said

1505
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,159
we all have our rough days

1506
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,159
but when you start your day

1507
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,159
with that mindset

1508
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,159
it's such a powerful thing

1509
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,159
isn't it

1510
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,159
and I don't know

1511
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,159
if you've noticed it

1512
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,159
but

1513
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,159
if I'm home

1514
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,159
and I've got things going with work

1515
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,159
that are stressing me out

1516
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,159
I try and compartmentalize

1517
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,159
but if I'm grumpy

1518
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,159
the chances are

1519
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,159
the kids are gonna be grumpy

1520
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,159
yeah

1521
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,159
whereas

1522
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,159
if I'm up and about

1523
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,159
having a laugh

1524
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,159
having fun

1525
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,159
the kids are usually

1526
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,159
in a much better place

1527
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,159
and so

1528
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,159
I think it's as important

1529
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,159
as home

1530
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,159
as it is

1531
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,159
as a work

1532
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,159
and so

1533
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,159
you've got a choice in that

1534
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,159
isn't it

1535
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,159
you can genuinely

1536
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,159
create that

1537
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,159
if you want to

1538
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
creating and sharing a vision

1539
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,159
we've spoken already about

1540
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,159
you know

1541
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,159
some of your

1542
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,159
you know

1543
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,159
visions coming to life

1544
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,159
in interesting spaces

1545
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,159
you know

1546
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,159
from supporting the front bar

1547
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,159
or

1548
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,159
bringing VB back

1549
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,159
we see leaders are really conscious

1550
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,159
about how they go about it

1551
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,159
dream big is

1552
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,159
AB InBev

1553
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,159
how have you gone about

1554
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,159
creating and sharing

1555
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,159
when I think of

1556
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:50,159
a vision

1557
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,159
one that springs to mind

1558
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,159
is

1559
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,159
the marketing leadership team

1560
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,159
so

1561
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,159
AB InBev's always been known as

1562
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,159
as we touched on earlier

1563
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:02,159
a company that's been

1564
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,159
phenomenal at M&A

1565
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,159
they've been known for

1566
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,159
zero-based budgeting

1567
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,159
known for

1568
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,159
procurement

1569
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,159
and frugality

1570
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,159
can you explain that before

1571
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,159
you know

1572
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,159
we know their mergers and acquisitions

1573
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,159
are enormous

1574
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,159
what's zero-based budgeting

1575
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,159
what does that mean

1576
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,159
zero-based budgeting

1577
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,159
is

1578
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,159
you know

1579
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,159
often a lot of companies say

1580
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,159
here was your budget last year

1581
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,159
here's your budget this year

1582
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,159
plus 10%

1583
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,159
minus 10%

1584
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,159
and depending on how the numbers are looking

1585
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,159
at AB InBev

1586
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,159
it's more about

1587
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,159
regardless of what happened last year

1588
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,159
what's the plan

1589
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:34,159
how are we going to win

1590
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,159
and what's the cost going to be

1591
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,159
bottoms up

1592
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,159
so it's a blank page every year

1593
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,159
yeah essentially

1594
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,159
that's the

1595
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
so you almost throw out last year's budget

1596
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,159
and so

1597
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,159
do it again is it

1598
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:44,159
yeah

1599
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,159
that's essentially the

1600
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,159
the concept of it

1601
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,159
and how it works

1602
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,159
and so

1603
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,159
you know if you dream big

1604
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,159
and you've got incredible plans

1605
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,159
and you're prepared to

1606
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,159
you know

1607
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,159
that you think you can grow by X amount

1608
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,159
you're going to need this

1609
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,159
there's your marketing

1610
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,159
and here's your plan

1611
00:43:58,159 --> 00:43:59,159
here's the cost going to be

1612
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,159
you need to be able to back it in

1613
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,159
and then you normally get a target on it

1614
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,159
and you know we

1615
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:05,159
the way our remuneration works is

1616
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,159
you know our bonuses are above the average

1617
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,159
and so bonus is really important

1618
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,159
but if you're going to go after it

1619
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,159
you're going to take a target on it

1620
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,159
it's going to impact your

1621
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,159
your pocket at the end of the day

1622
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,159
whether you're going to get your bonus or not

1623
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,159
so

1624
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,159
it is a very important concept

1625
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,159
so yeah

1626
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,159
that was

1627
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,159
that's zero-based budgeting

1628
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,159
that's what we're known for

1629
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:27,159
but what we haven't been known for

1630
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:28,159
is our marketing

1631
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,159
and

1632
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,159
that was

1633
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:31,159
when I

1634
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,159
2017

1635
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:33,159
I remember

1636
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,159
we were in Mexico

1637
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,159
we had our global marketing leadership team conference

1638
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:39,159
and

1639
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,159
we had this conversation

1640
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,159
we were like

1641
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,159
I'm sick of being known

1642
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,159
as a zero-based budgeting company

1643
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,159
a company known for mergers and acquisition

1644
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,159
why aren't we renowned as a marketing company

1645
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,159
you know

1646
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:54,159
a company that can grow organically top line

1647
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,159
because there aren't many more other companies to buy

1648
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,159
where we're going to be able to take the synergies

1649
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:01,159
and increase our bottom line

1650
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,159
we need to start driving top line growth

1651
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,159
and so

1652
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,159
there were lots of debates at the time

1653
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,159
and we decided

1654
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:08,159
you know what

1655
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,159
we want to be the best marketing team in the world

1656
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:11,159
and

1657
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,159
we decided

1658
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,159
how are we going to measure that

1659
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,159
and really the two big measures were like

1660
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,159
we want to be known as

1661
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,159
the creative marketer of the year at Cannes

1662
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:19,159
which is

1663
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:20,159
you know

1664
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,159
probably the

1665
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,159
the biggest reward you can get

1666
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:25,159
the biggest award for marketers

1667
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,159
in the world

1668
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,159
and then

1669
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,159
we also want to be the most effective marketing company

1670
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,159
in the world

1671
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,159
which is

1672
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,159
the

1673
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:33,159
the FES index

1674
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,159
and so it's been a big five-year journey

1675
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,159
and it hasn't

1676
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:39,159
been a fluke

1677
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,159
so we've sort of put systems in place

1678
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,159
and it really came down

1679
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,159
we call it the three P's

1680
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,159
so people

1681
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,159
sorry for those listening before you

1682
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,159
you know

1683
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,159
you've just won those awards on a global scale

1684
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,159
which is a remarkable achievement

1685
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,159
to

1686
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,159
put you

1687
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:52,159
you're competing with the Nikes

1688
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,159
and

1689
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,159
they're the previous winners

1690
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,159
sorry before you continue on

1691
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,159
yeah

1692
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,159
yeah it was

1693
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,159
yeah

1694
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,159
this year

1695
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,159
we sort of had all

1696
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,159
all-time volume high

1697
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,159
so the highest volumes we've ever had

1698
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,159
at the company

1699
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,159
our brand equity

1700
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:06,159
which we call brand power

1701
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:08,159
is at an all-time high

1702
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:09,159
and

1703
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,159
this year

1704
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:11,159
we won

1705
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,159
creative marketer of the year

1706
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,159
at Cannes

1707
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,159
and number one

1708
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:16,159
for the most effective marketing company in the world

1709
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:17,159
so

1710
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,159
you talk about dreams

1711
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,159
you talk about dreaming big

1712
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,159
you know five years ago

1713
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:22,159
we were ranked 42nd

1714
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,159
and

1715
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,159
we said we wanted to be number one

1716
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,159
and people laughed at us

1717
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,159
at first

1718
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,159
you know

1719
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,159
AB InBev

1720
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,159
you know your M&A company

1721
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,159
and we're like no

1722
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,159
we're gonna be the best marketing company in the world

1723
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,159
and

1724
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,159
credit to the team

1725
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,159
that have been involved

1726
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,159
Miguel Patricio was our CMO at the time

1727
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,159
and

1728
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:41,159
he really led the way

1729
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:43,159
to foster this creativity

1730
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,159
across the entire organization

1731
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,159
and he put the right people in place

1732
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:49,159
that were modern marketers

1733
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,159
and

1734
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,159
then we created culture and capabilities team

1735
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,159
across all our markets

1736
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,159
and then

1737
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:56,159
we put processes in place

1738
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,159
so we created like a creative spectrum

1739
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:00,159
the way we talk about the work

1740
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,159
from a one to a ten

1741
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:04,159
and we set up like a brain trust

1742
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,159
we would have external and internal people

1743
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,159
to talk about the work

1744
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,159
to make the work better

1745
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,159
and then we

1746
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,159
sort of overhauled our partners

1747
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:13,159
and we got the best people around us

1748
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,159
the best agencies around us

1749
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,159
and having those all set up

1750
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,159
you know

1751
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,159
it wasn't just one country

1752
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,159
that was being recognized

1753
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,159
we had basically all our countries around the world

1754
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,159
being recognized as the best marketers

1755
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,159
in the world

1756
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,159
which ultimately became the global company

1757
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,159
so

1758
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,159
it's been something that

1759
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,159
I've been privileged to be part of this team

1760
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,159
and it's been an incredible journey

1761
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:35,159
great story

1762
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:36,159
all around

1763
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,159
we see leaders are curious

1764
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,159
and they

1765
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,159
and they

1766
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,159
have curiosity as a way

1767
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:41,159
that they approach getting better

1768
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,159
and learning

1769
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,159
and developing

1770
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:45,159
is curiosity a word that resonates with you?

1771
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,159
for sure

1772
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,159
and

1773
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,159
when I think about curiosity

1774
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,159
you know it's big for marketers

1775
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:53,159
to be curious

1776
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,159
always trying to sort of find that edge

1777
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,159
I think one thing about curiosity

1778
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,159
is we always always ask the questions

1779
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:01,159
the why

1780
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:02,159
you know

1781
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,159
and we don't just ask why once

1782
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,159
like why

1783
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:05,159
why

1784
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:06,159
why

1785
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:07,159
it might not be the fourth or fifth why

1786
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,159
until you get

1787
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,159
the insight

1788
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,159
or the nugget

1789
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,159
or the root cause of the problem

1790
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,159
that you can then

1791
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,159
ideate against

1792
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,159
and

1793
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,159
and

1794
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,159
come up with plans

1795
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:18,159
that can

1796
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:19,159
you know

1797
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:20,159
create opportunities

1798
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,159
so

1799
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,159
I think that's quite important

1800
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,159
as you work your way down

1801
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:24,159
to what the real problem is

1802
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,159
that you're

1803
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:26,159
that you're going up against

1804
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,159
and then we're quite fierce on the

1805
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:28,159
problem

1806
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,159
rather than

1807
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,159
the person

1808
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,159
so we

1809
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,159
we make sure

1810
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,159
we never get personal

1811
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:34,159
we go hard at the problem

1812
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,159
and I think

1813
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:36,159
you know

1814
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,159
a question we quite often ask ourselves

1815
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:38,159
is like

1816
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:39,159
well why not

1817
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:40,159
you know

1818
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:41,159
if there's a good idea there

1819
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,159
you know

1820
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,159
why not

1821
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,159
let's give it a go

1822
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,159
and if it doesn't

1823
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,159
it doesn't take a huge amount of resource

1824
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,159
you know

1825
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,159
it's worth having a go

1826
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,159
and we

1827
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,159
we talk about this concept of

1828
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:51,159
bullets versus cannonballs

1829
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,159
and I think where people make a trap is

1830
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:54,159
they go all in on the cannonball

1831
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,159
rather than shooting multiple bullets

1832
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,159
calibrating the bullets

1833
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,159
and then shooting the cannonball

1834
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,159
and

1835
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,159
you know

1836
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:03,159
a good example was

1837
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:04,159
we launched a brand Great Northern

1838
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,159
just in Queensland

1839
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,159
for three years

1840
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,159
we calibrated that bullet

1841
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:08,159
before we went national

1842
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:09,159
and shot the cannonball

1843
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,159
and now it's

1844
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,159
the biggest beer brand in Australia

1845
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:13,159
we did the same with Cubs

1846
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,159
we did the same with Carlton Dry

1847
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,159
it was like three years in

1848
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,159
in Western Australia

1849
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,159
where we just shot that bullet

1850
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,159
we calibrated it

1851
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,159
we had

1852
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,159
Kim Sturgio

1853
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,159
and Dean Turner at the time

1854
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,159
that were right behind NWA

1855
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,159
and then we took it nationally

1856
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:28,159
and it's you know

1857
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:29,159
it's top three or third or fourth

1858
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:30,159
biggest brand in Australia

1859
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,159
and

1860
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:32,159
I think even the front bar

1861
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,159
was a good example

1862
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:34,159
calibrating the bullet

1863
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:35,159
online

1864
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,159
afl.com.au

1865
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,159
before it went on to the main station

1866
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:40,159
so

1867
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:41,159
a big thing for us is

1868
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,159
be curious

1869
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:43,159
test and learn

1870
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:44,159
and

1871
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,159
shoot a few bullets

1872
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,159
work out what's working

1873
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:47,159
before you go big

1874
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,159
it's a great lesson

1875
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,159
and it applies to

1876
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,159
so many different spaces

1877
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,159
I love the way you described that

1878
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,159
marketing

1879
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,159
communicating with clarity

1880
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,159
hand in hand

1881
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,159
and it's all about

1882
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,159
communication stories

1883
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,159
can you give us an insight into how

1884
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:01,159
you think about

1885
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,159
your communication

1886
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:06,159
I think communicating with clarity

1887
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:08,159
is critical

1888
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:09,159
and

1889
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,159
one thing we

1890
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:11,159
I think about is

1891
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:12,159
how do you

1892
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:13,159
manage

1893
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,159
to make the complex simple

1894
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,159
and the simple powerful

1895
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:18,159
and

1896
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:19,159
there's always so many

1897
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,159
so much data

1898
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,159
so many data points

1899
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:23,159
how can you pull out

1900
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,159
the right data

1901
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,159
to be able to tell

1902
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,159
a powerful story

1903
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,159
and

1904
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,159
I've seen over my career

1905
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:31,159
it's become

1906
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,159
more and more important

1907
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,159
storytelling

1908
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,159
and

1909
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:37,159
the ability to be able to tell

1910
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,159
a story

1911
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:39,159
in a simple

1912
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:41,159
but powerful way

1913
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,159
and

1914
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:43,159
I actually think it's

1915
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:44,159
what differentiates

1916
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:45,159
a lot of leaders

1917
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:46,159
from middle management

1918
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,159
to senior leaders

1919
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:49,159
and as you

1920
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,159
when you're presenting

1921
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,159
to the executive team

1922
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:52,159
when you're presenting

1923
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:53,159
to the board

1924
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,159
very smart people

1925
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:55,159
they don't want you waffling on

1926
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,159
they want to know

1927
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,159
what's the problem

1928
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,159
what's your recommendation

1929
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,159
and then let's have the debate

1930
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,159
and you need to be able to

1931
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,159
pinpoint

1932
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:04,159
what the problem is

1933
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,159
very quickly

1934
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,159
tell your story

1935
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,159
give your recommendation

1936
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:08,159
and

1937
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,159
I think that's critical

1938
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,159
yeah

1939
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:11,159
it's a great

1940
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:12,159
you know

1941
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,159
the storytelling aspect of it

1942
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:14,159
isn't it

1943
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,159
as you said

1944
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,159
without waffling

1945
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,159
people pick that up

1946
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,159
pretty quickly

1947
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,159
but

1948
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,159
in a business your size

1949
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,159
I suspect

1950
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,159
there's not a lot of room

1951
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,159
for error

1952
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:24,159
on the way you do that

1953
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,159
collaboration we see

1954
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:26,159
is something that leaders

1955
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,159
genuinely pursue now

1956
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:28,159
Rich more

1957
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,159
than ever

1958
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:30,159
I mean

1959
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,159
you're in

1960
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,159
over 100 countries

1961
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,159
around the world

1962
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:34,159
how important

1963
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,159
has collaboration been

1964
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,159
collaboration's

1965
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,159
very

1966
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,159
very important

1967
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:40,159
I've learned over the years

1968
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,159
that

1969
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,159
it's more about

1970
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:43,159
I

1971
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,159
you know

1972
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:45,159
and you're sort of worried about

1973
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:46,159
yourself

1974
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,159
and performing

1975
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:49,159
but as you mature

1976
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:50,159
and you become more experienced

1977
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:51,159
you realise it's about we

1978
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:53,159
and you need to play your role

1979
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,159
with the rest of the team

1980
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:56,159
if you're going to win

1981
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:58,159
not that dissimilar to

1982
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,159
to sport

1983
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,159
to corporate

1984
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,159
so you start changing

1985
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,159
the language

1986
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,159
and the tone

1987
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,159
it's very much about we

1988
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,159
and then as you

1989
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,159
get to more senior leaders position

1990
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,159
it actually becomes about you

1991
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,159
and

1992
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,159
and

1993
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:13,159
you know you can't deliver results

1994
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,159
on your own anymore

1995
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:15,159
you have to deliver results

1996
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:16,159
through other people

1997
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:18,159
so it's all about getting the best

1998
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:19,159
out of others

1999
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:20,159
and how can you

2000
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:22,159
better understand these people

2001
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,159
give the clear direction

2002
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:24,159
and

2003
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:25,159
you know

2004
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,159
global roles in particular

2005
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:29,159
you need strong collaboration

2006
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,159
and when you're building

2007
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:31,159
global brands

2008
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:32,159
you want

2009
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:33,159
positioning to be clear

2010
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:34,159
consistent around the world

2011
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,159
you want clear creative tracks

2012
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,159
you need to be clear on

2013
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,159
the do's and the don'ts

2014
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,159
so that you can provide a framework

2015
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,159
for the local markets

2016
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,159
but they have freedom

2017
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,159
within that framework

2018
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,159
and

2019
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:46,159
you know

2020
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:47,159
World Cup

2021
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:48,159
we just activated over

2022
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:49,159
76 countries

2023
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:50,159
and

2024
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:51,159
you need to have

2025
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:52,159
empathy for the different markets

2026
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,159
the different restrictions

2027
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:54,159
that they have

2028
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:55,159
and

2029
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:56,159
you know

2030
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,159
often I talk about

2031
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:58,159
to the team

2032
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,159
that

2033
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,159
you need to have them

2034
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:01,159
the markets

2035
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,159
with skin in the game

2036
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,159
that's why we set up

2037
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,159
steering committees

2038
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:05,159
went for each brand

2039
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,159
and

2040
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,159
and

2041
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,159
and

2042
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,159
you know

2043
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,159
you have a brand

2044
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:11,159
so you have representation

2045
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:12,159
from the different markets

2046
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,159
and it's a little bit

2047
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,159
it's like a piece of string

2048
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,159
when you

2049
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,159
you can't push string

2050
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,159
on the markets

2051
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,159
and

2052
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,159
when you try and shove things

2053
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,159
down their throat

2054
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:21,159
it's never successful

2055
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,159
they've got to pull the string

2056
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:23,159
they've got to pull you in

2057
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,159
and

2058
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,159
you've got to work together

2059
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:26,159
you know

2060
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,159
for it to be successful

2061
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:28,159
to

2062
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:29,159
to really build these global brands

2063
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:30,159
with consistency around the world

2064
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:31,159
yeah

2065
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,159
fascinating stories

2066
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:33,159
I mean

2067
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,159
you think about that

2068
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,159
76 different countries

2069
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:36,159
with all the nuances

2070
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,159
and all the restrictions

2071
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:38,159
and regulations

2072
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:39,159
but trying to tell one story

2073
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,159
it's a great analogy

2074
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,159
isn't it

2075
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:42,159
if you force something on anyone

2076
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,159
all the research says that

2077
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,159
it's never taken well

2078
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,159
isn't it

2079
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,159
never succeeds

2080
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,159
but

2081
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,159
I'm assuming in practice

2082
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,159
you've got to live that every day

2083
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,159
to get it right

2084
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:53,159
Richard it's a

2085
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:54,159
it's a brilliant insight

2086
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:56,159
it's a fascinating story

2087
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,159
but asking these

2088
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:58,159
two questions of everyone

2089
00:53:58,159 --> 00:53:59,159
who's been the greatest leader

2090
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:00,159
in your life

2091
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,440
that's a

2092
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
that's a

2093
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
a big question

2094
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,440
you know

2095
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,440
my parents have had a huge influence

2096
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,440
over me

2097
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
um

2098
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
if you ask

2099
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
who's the best leader in our family

2100
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,440
it's Rose

2101
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,440
100%

2102
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,440
um

2103
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
when I think about

2104
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,440
my career

2105
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,440
there's been so many people

2106
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,440
over the career

2107
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
that's one thing I

2108
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
I really feel fortunate

2109
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
I've had so many great leaders

2110
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,440
and

2111
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,440
I've tried to pick the best out of

2112
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,440
each of the leaders

2113
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,440
to try and help shape

2114
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
the way I lead

2115
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,440
um

2116
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,440
I mean

2117
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,440
the one that comes to mind

2118
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,440
it's probably going to sound like

2119
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,440
I'm sucking up

2120
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,440
but

2121
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,440
I know this is a

2122
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,440
a global podcast

2123
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,440
you probably won't listen to it

2124
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
but if I

2125
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,440
if you will now

2126
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,440
I'm very impressed

2127
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
our CEO at the moment

2128
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
our CEO

2129
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
is Michelle Ducaris

2130
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,440
and he

2131
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,440
he took over

2132
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
about 18 months ago

2133
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
and I was always impressed with him

2134
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
but

2135
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
he's done a

2136
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
sensational job

2137
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
he's come in

2138
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
and

2139
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,440
you know

2140
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
the first thing he really did

2141
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
was like set

2142
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
the vision for the company

2143
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,440
and that was

2144
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,440
we dream big

2145
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
which has always been

2146
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
in our DNA

2147
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
to create a future

2148
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
with more cheers

2149
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
and then

2150
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
instead of creating like

2151
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
a three year plan

2152
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
or a five year plan

2153
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
he developed

2154
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
the ten year plan

2155
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,440
so he's already looking

2156
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,440
ten years out

2157
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
for the company

2158
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
and then

2159
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
you know

2160
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
structure always follows strategy

2161
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
so he's put a

2162
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
you know

2163
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
a new structure in place

2164
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
that makes a lot more sense

2165
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
uh

2166
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
the way we're now together

2167
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
as a commercial organisation

2168
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,440
and the way he simplified the business

2169
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
into how we're going to lead

2170
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,440
and grow the category

2171
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,440
how we're going to digitise

2172
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
and monetise

2173
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
the company

2174
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
and then how we optimise the business

2175
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
so essentially

2176
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
how do you pay down debt

2177
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
what do you do with that money

2178
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
to drive future growth

2179
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
and it's just so simple

2180
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
but everyone understands

2181
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
the strategy

2182
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
which

2183
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
for such a big

2184
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
complex business

2185
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
the way he's been able

2186
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
to simplify

2187
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
the complexity

2188
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
and

2189
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
and with clarity

2190
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,440
is

2191
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,440
is so powerful

2192
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,440
and

2193
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
he's someone

2194
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,440
that

2195
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,440
I think we touched about

2196
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
earlier

2197
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
with self confidence

2198
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,440
you know

2199
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
he's not arrogant

2200
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
at all

2201
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,440
he's self confident

2202
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
and everything

2203
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
every time you're in a meeting

2204
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
with him

2205
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
he asks the right questions

2206
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
he asks tough questions

2207
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,440
he sort of leads you down a path

2208
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
that you know

2209
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,440
you normally get the answer

2210
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
and he has that self confidence

2211
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,440
given the experience

2212
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
and success

2213
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
he's had over the years

2214
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,440
and that conviction

2215
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
that

2216
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
you know

2217
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
you're heading down the right path

2218
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,440
and

2219
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,440
what's his background

2220
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,440
Rich where is he

2221
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,440
in the business for

2222
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
so he's been in the business

2223
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
for

2224
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,440
25 plus years

2225
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,440
so he's

2226
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
you know

2227
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,440
a lifer

2228
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
at AB InBev

2229
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,440
you know

2230
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,440
across

2231
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
multiple zones

2232
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
so Brazil

2233
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
he's a Brazilian guy

2234
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
and

2235
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
had a lot of success

2236
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
in Brazil

2237
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
in the early days

2238
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,440
then he went and ran

2239
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,440
China

2240
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,440
and

2241
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,440
you know

2242
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,440
Michelle

2243
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
was one of the big reasons

2244
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
why we've been so successful

2245
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,440
in China

2246
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
with the likes of Budweiser

2247
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,440
he really championed

2248
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,440
our China business

2249
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,440
and then

2250
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
he went and took on

2251
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
the big challenge

2252
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
to run North America

2253
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
and

2254
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
for the last

2255
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
five years

2256
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
he was running

2257
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
the US business

2258
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
and obviously Canada as well

2259
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
so

2260
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,440
he's run our three biggest

2261
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
zones

2262
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,440
he's delivered

2263
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
amazing results

2264
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,440
and he was rewarded

2265
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,440
to take on the CEO role

2266
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
he's just a very

2267
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,440
very impressive guy

2268
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,440
Rich

2269
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
we saw you handing

2270
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
the trophy over

2271
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
to Harry Kane

2272
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
recently

2273
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,440
so

2274
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,440
we know

2275
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,440
the level

2276
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
you're dealing at

2277
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
but

2278
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,440
in the spirit of collaboration

2279
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,440
which we love

2280
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,440
if you could collaborate

2281
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,440
with anyone

2282
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,440
on anything

2283
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,440
is there

2284
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,440
a name

2285
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
that springs to mind

2286
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
that springs to mind

2287
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I'd love to play soccer

2288
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
with Harry Kane

2289
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
but

2290
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,440
I think from a business perspective

2291
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,440
there's a guy who

2292
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
you might not know

2293
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
but his name's

2294
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Scott Galloway

2295
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
and

2296
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
he

2297
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
he

2298
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
is one of the smartest guys

2299
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,440
I've ever come across

2300
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,440
I've only met him twice

2301
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
so I don't

2302
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
I don't really know him

2303
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,440
I'm not friends with him

2304
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
he started a

2305
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
profit

2306
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,440
which is

2307
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
like a marketing consultancy

2308
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
that's been very successful

2309
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,440
and he mentors a lot of CEOs

2310
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,440
and he's got a podcast

2311
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,440
that I listen to

2312
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,440
yeah

2313
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
every week

2314
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
it's on Pivot

2315
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
it's called Pivot

2316
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
with Kara Swisher

2317
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,440
it's one of the top podcasts

2318
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
business podcasts in the world

2319
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,440
and he's also got the Prof Galloway podcast

2320
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
and

2321
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
I learned so much from him

2322
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,440
he's

2323
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
so smart

2324
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,440
everything from

2325
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
you know

2326
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,440
he thinks the way CEOs think

2327
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
he's

2328
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
gives you an insight

2329
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,440
into what the big businesses are going through

2330
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,440
what their challenges are

2331
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,440
how

2332
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,440
he would handle the different situations

2333
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,440
he's not a fan of Elon Musk

2334
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,440
but he

2335
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,440
you know

2336
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
to tell you the whole story about

2337
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,440
what's happening with Twitter

2338
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
and the impact that's going to have on Tesla

2339
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,440
and

2340
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
he also gets quite caught up in like

2341
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
the geopolitics of the world

2342
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,440
and so he's got a very

2343
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
you know

2344
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
very thoughtful view

2345
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,440
on the world

2346
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
and I learned a lot from him

2347
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,440
on what's going on in China

2348
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,440
versus the different markets

2349
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
and then how does that

2350
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
impact

2351
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
could impact our business

2352
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,440
so

2353
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
very very smart guy

2354
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,440
if I ever went into business

2355
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,440
yeah

2356
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,440
if he took my phone call

2357
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
yeah I'd love to collaborate with him

2358
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,440
The Scott Galloway podcast

2359
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,440
is that how you find it?

2360
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Yeah

2361
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440
look up Pivot

2362
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
it's Scott Galloway and Kara Swisher

2363
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,440
Pivot

2364
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,440
and he's also got his own one

2365
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Prof Galloway

2366
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,440
but the Pivot one I love

2367
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,440
because it's more Kara Swisher interviewing Scott

2368
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,440
so you hear more about Scott

2369
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,440
his other one

2370
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,440
he's interviewing other people

2371
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,440
but he's

2372
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,440
he's phenomenal

2373
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,440
I love it Rich

2374
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,440
I know you're on a tight schedule

2375
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,440
you're back home with the family

2376
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,440
so to take some time out

2377
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,440
we really appreciate

2378
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,440
it's always great to

2379
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,440
to see you mate

2380
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I love what you've done

2381
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,440
on a global scale

2382
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,440
you haven't changed at all

2383
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,440
straight back to family

2384
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,440
still getting told off

2385
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,440
by your brother-in-law

2386
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,440
and fronting up to the family Christmas

2387
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
which is awesome

2388
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,440
and thanks again

2389
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,440
for being part of a Leader Connect

2390
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,440
we're really rapt to have your insight

2391
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,440
and leadership as part of that

2392
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,440
and long may it continue

2393
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,440
no problem Das

2394
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
it's been great to catch up again

2395
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,440
and credit to you and Matt

2396
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
the Leader Connect

2397
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,440
is something I think is really powerful

2398
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,440
and it's going to have a big impact

2399
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
so if people have the chance to be part of it

2400
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,440
I highly recommend it

2401
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,440
very kind mate

2402
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
