00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,839
The legendary footballer and pundit Rio Ferdinand

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,419
is today's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,859
He's passionate about leading by example,

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,339
honest about the journey he's taken to become a better communicator,

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:17,820
especially on the home front,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,440
and has some incredible insights to share

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,179
about harnessing the power of your competitive spirit.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,879
He also talks candidly about his relationships

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,579
with the great Sir Alex Ferguson

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,600
and quite possibly the most famous person,

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,119
not just player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,899
He has a huge intelligence and an appetite to evolve

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,659
and to be curious, where are the margins at

14
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,119
in terms of researching sleep, researching physiotherapy,

15
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,420
researching setting the ambience in a room with crystals.

16
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,340
He does mad stuff, talking to NASA about recovery.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,560
There ain't many players that are doing that, if any.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,100
Rio Ferdinand epitomises everything that we do at Alita

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,780
and it has been a great privilege for us to have Rio collaborate

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,539
in our Alita Connect program.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,700
We curate groups of five to six people from around the globe

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,100
to come to Alita Connect.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,359
We come together to learn, to share and to collaborate.

24
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,840
You can head to alitacollective.com

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,379
and we would love to chat to you

26
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,920
or book a discovery call today.

27
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,120
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,340
and his team from Temper Bedding,

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,799
the best mattress in the world, NASA approved.

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,599
We know great leaders like Rio Ferdinand value sleep

31
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,120
and investing in a mattress like Temper

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,819
is a decision you won't regret.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,879
Rio Ferdinand is a legend of English football,

34
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,219
former England captain and represented his country

35
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,500
on 81 occasions, including being part

36
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,739
of three FIFA World Cup competitions.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,340
He's one of the most decorated English footballers of all time

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,859
and regarded as one of England's greatest ever players.

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,019
He's an English football and Premier League Hall of Famer

40
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,659
who captained Manchester United

41
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,200
to a Champions League final victory in 2008,

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,400
one of 14 trophies he won

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,739
across an extraordinary professional career.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,459
Rio is an officer of the Order of the British Empire

45
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,939
for his services to football

46
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,700
and his incredible contribution

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,659
in the Rio Ferdinand Foundation

48
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,340
addressing the issues of inequality Rio experienced

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,739
growing up in England.

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,939
Rio is a respected broadcaster,

51
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,360
documentary filmmaker,

52
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,520
start-up investor in We Are 8,

53
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,419
a social media platform for good,

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,759
a father of five and respected

55
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,180
for his leadership qualities from a young age.

56
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,620
Rio, it's great to catch up with you.

57
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,419
Thanks for taking the time.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
It's an extraordinary life that you've led

59
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
and look back at your professional career,

60
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,819
captaining Manchester United,

61
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,599
captaining England.

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,259
When I read that back to you,

63
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,699
what are the thoughts on when you reflect back on your career?

64
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,939
Yeah, satisfaction I think is the most important thing.

65
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:34,719
I think you set out,

66
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,479
in a career,

67
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,659
whatever industry it is,

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,099
you set out to kind of do well

69
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,099
and fulfil potential

70
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,860
and to gain the respect of people

71
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,759
that are in your industry

72
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,400
but also outside if that's possible.

73
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,080
And I remember when I signed for Man United,

74
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,240
I think in my press conference,

75
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,960
that's what I said.

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,740
I said, if I can leave this club

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,500
when I walk out the doors,

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
as long as I've etched my name

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,139
in the fabric of the club in a good way,

80
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,520
which will mean having to win some stuff,

81
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,500
then I would see that

82
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,360
as being a success

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,900
and I'd like to think that I've probably done that.

84
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,460
You're 23 years of age

85
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,900
and you were named as captain of Leeds.

86
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,960
You go on, as I said,

87
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:13,659
to captain England,

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
captain of the famous Manchester United.

89
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,539
What were the traits, do you think,

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,800
that people saw in you

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,340
to have you as a leader at such a young age?

92
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,879
I think the fact that I could communicate

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,139
would probably be one of my strongest points.

94
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,419
I think communication is something

95
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,599
that's enabled me to have an afterlife in football as well

96
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,759
in some of the businesses that I'm involved in.

97
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,759
But on a football pitch

98
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,139
and in a,

99
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,360
in a football environment,

100
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,460
I think communication and connecting,

101
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,000
listen,

102
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,280
a group of men,

103
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,159
one of my teammates,

104
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,800
likened it to being like 25 sharks in one room

105
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,479
and being able to kind of connect those dots

106
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,259
and connect those people

107
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,180
from different backgrounds,

108
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,960
different ages,

109
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,680
really is important in cultivating a good environment

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,120
that's conducive to winning trophies,

111
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,439
not only winning a trophy,

112
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,099
but winning on for a long period of time

113
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:00,800
and consistently.

114
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,319
And I think that's a key.

115
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,000
Obviously,

116
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,099
performance has to be,

117
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,539
they have a high standard consistently as well

118
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,560
on a day-to-day basis,

119
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,120
setting them standards on a day-to-day

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,719
was definitely key as well.

121
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,800
So those areas there were probably the first things

122
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,620
that probably stood out,

123
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,540
I think, for any manager

124
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,899
who's kind of contemplating giving me the armband

125
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,819
and making me the captain.

126
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
Listen, I think you'd notice

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,079
being somebody who's been involved in sport as well

128
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,980
is that being able to talk to different types of people

129
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,899
all in different ways is so key

130
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,779
in making sure that you hit the right notes

131
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,120
with people.

132
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,120
To create a place where people feel like

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,379
they're okay to make mistakes,

134
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,439
they'll get caught and held by other people

135
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,100
in a change room,

136
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,519
but also where they know there is a level of expectancy

137
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,060
on a regular basis.

138
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,639
It's an interesting description,

139
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,519
25 sharks swimming around the one room.

140
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,139
And it makes sense to me

141
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,959
because effectively you're competing first and foremost

142
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,639
for your own spot in a team,

143
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,199
particularly at the high level

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,759
of English Premier League football.

145
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,620
And you've got incredibly talented people,

146
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,939
lots of big ego,

147
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,319
lots of people who think they should play

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,579
a role that maybe someone else has got.

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,439
And so it's not an easy mix, isn't it,

150
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,920
to get team harmony,

151
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,360
but you obviously had a way of being able

152
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,279
to relate to everyone,

153
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,680
even if they came from different backgrounds.

154
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,660
Do you feel like that was a real skill of yours?

155
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:21,160
Yeah, definitely.

156
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,360
And I think that 25 sharks,

157
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,439
the analogy is like you say,

158
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:29,240
every single player in that squad

159
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,060
of 26 players think they should be starting.

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,079
There's 26 international players,

161
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,259
we play for their countries

162
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,399
and there's probably 10,

163
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,779
maybe 11 captains of their countries

164
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,920
in our dressing room at any one time.

165
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,240
So then to make sure that you create

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,279
a harmonious environment is absolutely imperative

167
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,540
because the moment you have one

168
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,100
who's a little bit disjointed

169
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,480
and steps out from the crowd

170
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,639
and is allowed to do that,

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
that becomes a bit of a cancerous person

172
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,540
who then spreads

173
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,120
and you can gain followers

174
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,600
and people that stand alongside him

175
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,060
because they're not in the team as well.

176
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
And then that obviously then becomes a big problem

177
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,259
for the squad,

178
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,079
the starting 11,

179
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,079
the management staff.

180
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,899
So that has to be managed.

181
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,379
And I think the manager doesn't really,

182
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
that's weird because Felix Ferguson

183
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,660
never really came into our changing room

184
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,839
on a day-to-day basis at a training ground.

185
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,620
He allowed not only the person wearing the armband,

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,420
but like I said,

187
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,939
there was other leaders in there as well

188
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,120
to really manage the standards as well

189
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,800
and punctuality, respect.

190
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,899
And I think that's a huge thing as well

191
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,180
is making sure that there's respect

192
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,740
in the dressing room between teammates

193
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,100
is a huge thing.

194
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,899
And the players have to manage that.

195
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,899
Like if someone steps out of line,

196
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,519
they do something wrong

197
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,379
or the intensity is not right on the day,

198
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,660
there has to be the ability and the space

199
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,439
for someone to challenge someone about that,

200
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,439
but also to receive that in the right way.

201
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,259
And if it isn't received in the right way,

202
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,319
that person needs to be told.

203
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,819
I'm fascinated that Sir Alex was someone

204
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,319
that really left the locker room to the players.

205
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,839
He didn't want to mingle and mix

206
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,019
and socialise in there.

207
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,199
That wasn't his go.

208
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,199
It was something that he let the players go,

209
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,939
and as you said,

210
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,399
run that space themselves.

211
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Was that different to other managers?

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeah.

213
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,079
I mean, some managers would come in,

214
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,560
not a problem,

215
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:11,800
and come in and see,

216
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,620
put their head in there once a week.

217
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't think a lot of managers come in there a lot,

218
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,060
but I was there 12, 13 years,

219
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,220
and he probably came in three or four times max.

220
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,399
And one of them was to say goodbye.

221
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,120
So I think the importance of,

222
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,800
and I think that's one of his greatest attributes

223
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,720
for Alex was that his ability to delegate

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,939
and give other people,

225
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,220
the space to kind of run their area of the football club,

226
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,879
whether it be logistics,

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
whether it be S&C,

228
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,740
whether it be the physiotherapy,

229
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,339
the doctor,

230
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,420
them areas are run by those people.

231
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,199
He was the overarching body that looked over things,

232
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,980
and if it wasn't working or there was mistakes,

233
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,959
and then you obviously go and see him,

234
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,720
but he would leave people with the ability

235
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,879
to go and do what you've got to do.

236
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:57,379
You're here.

237
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,240
I think that's a good thing he always used to talk about.

238
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,100
You're here because you're good enough.

239
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
I've seen something in you that makes you good enough.

240
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,079
Go and do that.

241
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,600
That really gives you the confidence to go and perform.

242
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Real, look, from an outsider looking in,

243
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,639
and we all loved your era and one of the great eras in sport

244
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,180
and the legend of Sir Alex Ferguson

245
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,319
and what you guys achieved,

246
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,220
but it looked like if you fell out with him, though,

247
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,379
it was a pretty short conversation,

248
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,860
and no matter how big you were,

249
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,000
if you're David Beckham or Raya Ferdinand

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,779
or whatever it was,

251
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:25,819
if you didn't quite fit,

252
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,699
could he be quite brutal in that scenario as well?

253
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,120
Yeah.

254
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,399
Obviously, everyone's heard of the hairdryer

255
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,059
where he unloads and gives it to you.

256
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,200
But I'll be honest,

257
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,220
I see a few people go back and forth with him.

258
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,720
Beck's one, definitely.

259
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,940
Roy, but I think it wasn't just like you had a problem,

260
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,220
there was an issue and it was done and it was over

261
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,259
and then you're gone.

262
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,019
It wasn't like that.

263
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,440
He was a fair person.

264
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,379
But once he made a decision on you,

265
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:51,639
that was it.

266
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,139
It was a definite.

267
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,580
And to be fair,

268
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,200
I had a few run-ins with him

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,460
where I would challenge a decision

270
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,580
or I wasn't happy about certain things.

271
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,600
And I think if he believed it was coming from the right place,

272
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,580
then...

273
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,620
in time, he'd get over it.

274
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,759
He wouldn't hold that grudge.

275
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,259
But if he believed that there was a bit more to it

276
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,659
or there was some skullduggery

277
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,620
or it just wasn't the right thing for the team,

278
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,679
then he wouldn't accept that.

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
And again,

280
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,840
if he thought you was a problem for the dressing room,

281
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:23,759
he would act very quickly.

282
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,340
And I think that's a really good trait

283
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,259
that I've kind of seen

284
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,399
and you'd take on into any walk of life.

285
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,980
You feel something,

286
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,379
you think it's not right,

287
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,600
you think it can harm the long-term processes,

288
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,820
get rid of it.

289
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,080
Well, reading your history,

290
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,580
you grew up in the council estate

291
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,240
in the tough neighbourhood of Peckham, South London.

292
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,159
Your parents separated when you were 14.

293
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,639
For you and your brother, Anton,

294
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,379
to go on and play professional football

295
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,659
feels like a remarkable story for me.

296
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,080
How did you find a way to succeed

297
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,860
given the challenges that you obviously faced?

298
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,700
It's weird.

299
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:55,200
Everyone says,

300
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
oh, challenging background.

301
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,840
It was obviously that we wasn't blessed

302
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,559
with loads of resources.

303
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,559
There was a lot of kind of untoward

304
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,679
stuff that would be going on around us

305
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,620
and on our estates

306
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,299
and police always there

307
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,159
and lots of issues that are going on.

308
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,940
But I do always look back

309
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,840
and just like it does bring a smile to my face

310
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,559
because there's lots of happy memories there

311
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,179
with my friends

312
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,340
and different cultures

313
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,120
and different people,

314
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,820
different backgrounds.

315
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,519
A lot of them I'm still friends with now.

316
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,899
So yeah, it was difficult,

317
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,139
but I think I was one of the fortunate ones

318
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,480
that my dad didn't choose to just go

319
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
and leave us.

320
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,279
Yes, my mum and dad separated,

321
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,919
but my dad lived on the next estate.

322
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,419
He made it a point of not moving far away.

323
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,179
Discipline was a huge thing in our household,

324
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,639
whether it be for my mum or my dad.

325
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,919
And so I always had someone to answer to.

326
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,679
And I think that's a lot for a kid.

327
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,799
When there's a lot of temptation

328
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,860
and a lot of kind of opportunity

329
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,299
for making the wrong decisions,

330
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,600
you do need to have that somebody

331
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,559
or that figure in your life,

332
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,399
whether it's a parent or a guardian

333
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,100
or a family member that you go,

334
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
oh, if I do make that decision,

335
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,379
what would they think?

336
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,600
And I had that

337
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
and I was fortunate enough to have that

338
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,580
with both my parents.

339
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,799
Obviously, my dad was a bit more

340
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,000
of a discipliner than my mum,

341
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,600
but for both,

342
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,480
I would add the respect of them

343
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,299
to kind of think about certain decisions

344
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:16,899
I would make.

345
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,620
And Rio, you were a champion gymnast as a kid.

346
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,879
You attended Central Ballet School in London

347
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,340
as an 11-year-old for a number of years.

348
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:25,320
It's an unusual path

349
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
to be a champion of English football.

350
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,620
Did you look back at

351
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,299
and think that they were helpful for you,

352
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,940
those early disciplines of ballet

353
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,580
and gymnastics?

354
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,860
Yeah, 100%.

355
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,000
I think it wasn't normal

356
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,480
for a kid from a council estate

357
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,080
to be going and doing gymnastics and ballet

358
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,779
three or four times a week.

359
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,580
But initially, it was just for adventure.

360
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,179
I was able to go off my estate,

361
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,220
go and meet new people, girls.

362
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,840
I was of that age.

363
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,519
And just going and speaking.

364
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,039
And again, that was part of my journey

365
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,240
in terms of being able to communicate with people,

366
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,139
having to forge new relationships

367
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,059
and new environments.

368
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,960
A way out of my comfort zone.

369
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,120
I've done that since I was 10, 11 years old.

370
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,220
So that then became one of my strong points

371
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,120
as a footballer.

372
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,860
New environments,

373
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,659
talking, communicating,

374
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,279
and getting in.

375
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
And so it helped me not only

376
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
from a physical aspect

377
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,379
with how difficult both of them disciplines are,

378
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,779
but definitely from a social aspect,

379
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
it really brought me on to no end.

380
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,139
You look back at the Manchester United era

381
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,580
we've spoken about briefly under Sir Alex

382
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:33,960
and you think,

383
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,980
you won trophies for fun.

384
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,639
League titles and Champions League titles.

385
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,740
It was an incredible era of success.

386
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:41,860
How would you describe,

387
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,000
what was the culture that enabled

388
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,159
that consistent success over such a long period of time

389
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,279
right throughout your career?

390
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,460
How would you sum that up?

391
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,299
Yeah, I mean, listen, it was wonderful times

392
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,879
and the memories are endless.

393
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,159
But one of the key things I think when I look back,

394
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,240
there's many things that it could have been the reasons for.

395
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,059
Not one of us will have the definitive answer,

396
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,700
but I've got no doubts in my mind

397
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,940
that one of the good contributors,

398
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,200
or that every single thing we put our hands to

399
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,980
was a competition.

400
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,200
Whether it be on the team bus playing cards,

401
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,100
whether it be playing computer games,

402
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,620
on travelling, in hotels,

403
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,960
whether it be playing table tennis pre and post training,

404
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,639
whether it be doing, I don't know,

405
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,120
a basketball warm-up game.

406
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,620
Every single thing we'd done was a competition.

407
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And the training games were harder

408
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,019
than the real-life matches

409
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,799
in terms of competitiveness.

410
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,159
Every day, it was like Friday before a game

411
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,940
was like eight-a-side game on the pitch.

412
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,960
And how many times did the manager have to stop the session

413
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,440
because it was getting a bit overheated

414
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,799
or it was just a real competitive energy

415
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,419
that just spread throughout the squad.

416
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,279
And there weren't many in there

417
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,639
that didn't have some sort of competitive energy

418
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,960
outside of the football pitch at some point of the day.

419
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,899
So that definitely contributed because it was always on.

420
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,100
And I think, to me,

421
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,740
that is the thing you can't manufacture in an athlete.

422
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,960
You have great skill and you can have great athleticism,

423
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,879
but to be an absolute animal,

424
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,980
competitor is probably the number one ingredient,

425
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,320
I think, in almost every sport.

426
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,399
So it's fascinating that you went straight to there.

427
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,500
You think that competitive edge set you apart

428
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,200
from the other teams?

429
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,179
Yeah, because you can't,

430
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:17,419
I don't think you can switch that will to win on and off.

431
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,580
Like, I play with my kid now.

432
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,279
He's three years old and I have to beat,

433
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:23,960
I just beat him.

434
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,399
He's got to learn the hard way.

435
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,919
He's got to learn.

436
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,500
And if I do let him win every now and again,

437
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,059
I do think like, why have I let him win?

438
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
And it's such a stupid little thing.

439
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
And you think, well, there's no competition,

440
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,519
but in my head, there's always a switch.

441
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,379
It's always competing.

442
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,080
I don't know why.

443
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,940
Or if I go on the dartboards in the office upstairs,

444
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,259
I have to throw three,

445
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,679
I can't come off there unless I hit a treble or a bullseye.

446
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:49,559
There's a competitive nature to everything.

447
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,320
And I just think that if you can be passive

448
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,460
and switch that off and then just go, yeah, next time,

449
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,460
that then trickles and filters in

450
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,659
to your everyday training regime.

451
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:03,779
And you're happy.

452
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:03,860
You're happy.

453
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:03,879
You're happy.

454
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,080
You've got habits on a daily basis.

455
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,720
And so, I don't know,

456
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,480
but even when I'm doing my punditry now,

457
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,279
I've got my foundation or with We Are Right,

458
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,279
you want it to be the best.

459
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,240
I want this to be the best social media platform

460
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,759
that does the best work for people

461
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,460
and the benefits of people are huge and for the environment.

462
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,860
These are the things that you,

463
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,600
I don't want to have a platform where it's better

464
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,240
for citizens to go on there and have better experiences

465
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,220
or they can gain more somewhere else.

466
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,740
This is just the way I am now.

467
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,940
Well, we're really privileged to cross over with you

468
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,600
in our Leader Connect space.

469
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
We bring together diverse groups of leaders

470
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,080
from five or six at a time from different backgrounds.

471
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,500
You're with Andy Cohen,

472
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,000
who's a global executive from JP Morgan,

473
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,679
Andy Walsh from Red Bull and Liminal,

474
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
Jude Bolton, who's a bit of a legend of Australian football,

475
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,120
and your great friend Zoe Kalar, who founded We Are Right.

476
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,740
We love the idea of people coming together

477
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,940
to sort of learn and share from different backgrounds

478
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,120
who maybe wouldn't have got together.

479
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,759
Can you tell us,

480
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,120
how the Leader Connect experience was for you?

481
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,519
No, I have to say thank you, by the way,

482
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,720
to Zoe for bringing me on

483
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,000
and just to kind of making me aware of it

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,720
and getting in a group of such esteemed professionals

485
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,860
from different backgrounds.

486
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,879
And I think there's always parallels.

487
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,539
One thing I've learned in retirement,

488
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,240
the amount of parallels from different industries

489
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,899
that cross over and things I've learned

490
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,580
and taken from sport can cross over

491
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,759
into many of the businesses that I'm involved in

492
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,559
and can only enhance them.

493
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,600
And likewise, the other way around.

494
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,659
Yeah, it's been phenomenal.

495
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,019
And the ability just to even have the communication

496
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,559
with these guys and to hear their stories and experiences.

497
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,080
And most importantly for me,

498
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,159
just their perspective on certain things and topics

499
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,600
has been invaluable.

500
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,960
I mean, the notes, if I show you my notepad

501
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,779
of when I was doing the calls,

502
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,799
I haven't really had an experience

503
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,139
where I can make so many meaningful notes

504
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,100
from other people's experiences.

505
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,159
And I think that's one of the things

506
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,000
that's definitely a big takeaway for me.

507
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Well, Mikel Arteta has been a great champion in our space.

508
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,680
He's in his third group now

509
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,019
with other leading coaches from around the globe.

510
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,059
He puts all of his leaders at Arsenal

511
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,740
and his assistant coaches through the same program.

512
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,559
And he loves that continuous learning and self-improvement.

513
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,579
From what you know of him and his recent success,

514
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,940
what do you think would motivate someone like that

515
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,539
who's so curious and wants to learn

516
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,000
someone like Mikel Arteta?

517
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,519
Yeah, I mean, once I was told that he was on these courses

518
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,920
and I'd done a few of them myself,

519
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,519
so I could...

520
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,839
I wasn't surprised.

521
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
I could totally see how and why he's here.

522
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,779
Like you say, I think he's a curious being,

523
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,359
first and foremost.

524
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:42,119
But he's a man of detail.

525
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,940
You can tell that.

526
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,019
He's a man of detail.

527
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,259
And from listening to the players that he's coaching now,

528
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,680
that there's a lot of details.

529
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,700
And again, his perspective and his viewpoint

530
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,819
on a lot of different aspects of their games

531
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:55,839
are coming from a different angle

532
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,039
to what they're used to hearing or seeing.

533
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,140
So that enlightens them.

534
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,420
It educates them.

535
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,980
But again,

536
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,059
you get that type of approach from a manager

537
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,099
that's a bit left-field.

538
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,920
You do start going,

539
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,160
whoa, this guy's different.

540
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,900
And then the belief comes.

541
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,099
And then that translates to the pitch at some point.

542
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,380
And I think they're starting to see the benefits of that now

543
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,160
through results.

544
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,839
The last two years, very close.

545
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,099
But I just see it as a matter of time

546
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:24,640
before he's one of the best coaches

547
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,440
in our game in the Premier League

548
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,160
because of his attention to detail

549
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,339
and his willingness to keep evolving and working.

550
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,200
And educating himself.

551
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,559
Ryo, people listening to you will think

552
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,900
what a dream life it is to be Ryo Ferdinand.

553
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,460
And you've had incredible success.

554
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,019
And I want to talk to you about some of your business success

555
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,380
and where you're at in a moment.

556
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,559
But when you read your backstory in preparation for this,

557
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,900
you've had more than your fair share of hardships

558
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,319
and setbacks in life as well.

559
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,319
And I read of the passing of Rebecca, your wife,

560
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,240
at 34 years of age from breast cancer.

561
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,180
And hard to imagine how difficult that would be.

562
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,180
You wrote a book about it, thinking out loud about that.

563
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,940
Tragic passing.

564
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,559
Can you share with people how you overcome tragedy

565
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,599
and setbacks of that nature in your life?

566
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,220
Yeah, I mean, it's a difficult, difficult time, I think.

567
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,059
We prepare for a lot of outcomes in our life

568
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,480
and scenarios that come up in our life.

569
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,839
But one thing we're not taught,

570
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,619
and it's never in any fairy tale books,

571
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,740
is death being a part of your life.

572
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,019
We never prepare kids for dying.

573
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,480
We definitely don't prepare people to lose people very young.

574
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,400
So when it happens, there's no book that you can get

575
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,680
that goes, right, this is a template.

576
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,019
And you add to that as well another layer that we have three kids.

577
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,960
So three young kids from eight downwards.

578
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,940
So to have to tell three young kids

579
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,119
that their mum's going to have to go to sleep

580
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,700
and never come back is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.

581
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,180
And I don't imagine I'll have anything,

582
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,740
I hope I don't anyway, as hard.

583
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,740
So yeah, I mean, listen to...

584
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,500
Being not prepared for anything in life is difficult,

585
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,380
but that was a real bolt.

586
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,539
And she went in hospital, actually,

587
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,960
and it was about six or seven weeks later,

588
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,900
then she passed away.

589
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,460
So it was a really quick kind of passing.

590
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,359
And that type of thing definitely puts you in a place where,

591
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,039
right, what the hell do I do?

592
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,299
And just sitting there asking yourself those questions.

593
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,299
And I think...

594
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,440
I was very fortunate that I had kids.

595
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,160
And as much as you don't want them to go through it,

596
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,980
but they were probably the biggest help for me

597
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,079
in that I had to get up every day.

598
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,680
I had to continue a structured life

599
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,539
and continue showing them that there is normality beyond this.

600
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,740
So getting up, going to work,

601
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,619
getting up, getting them dressed,

602
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,599
doing breakfast and taking them to school

603
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,759
as normal as possible

604
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,299
was a big thing for them to continue their life

605
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,180
and to get back to some sort of normality.

606
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,640
Because it'd be quite easy to just kind of fold up

607
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,880
like a pack of cards, really,

608
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,079
and just like, right, give up.

609
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,059
And I'll say, I said this in the book

610
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,619
and the documentary that I've done around it,

611
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,319
is that like, I'd never understood suicide before.

612
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,039
I still don't understand it totally,

613
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,279
but I appreciate when somebody might have thoughts like that.

614
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,680
When you think that, right, where do I go now?

615
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,019
There's no way, there's no light at the end of the tunnel.

616
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,240
But I think, again, I was very fortunate.

617
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,279
I was fortunate that I had good people around me,

618
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,019
family, friends.

619
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,559
And unfortunately, to be fair,

620
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,299
my mum became like the second mum,

621
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,500
but she then passed away about 18 months, two years later from cancer.

622
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,900
So it was a bit of a double whammy.

623
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,059
But again, that support system

624
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,640
and one of the probably biggest things that came out of it,

625
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,940
as much as I was a good communicator in a change room,

626
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,980
I was a terrible communicator to do with feelings and family.

627
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,799
And I'd never had to really consider that.

628
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,980
And it wasn't until Rebecca passed away.

629
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,180
And then my mum left shortly after where I have to talk and communicate to my children

630
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,220
because I need to get and extract conversations out of them to see how they are more.

631
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,819
But they're difficult conversations that I've never really been good at having.

632
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,299
So I had to break down to embarrass myself.

633
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,140
Because now my kids are very good communicators, confident kids.

634
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,779
And you put them in a room, you wouldn't know that they've been through what they're doing.

635
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,480
So that's how I kind of gauge where we're at.

636
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,799
So they're doing really well.

637
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,099
So you really found that you had to find a way to just be more open on the home front with your emotions

638
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:44,180
and learn to discuss more openly with your kids because of what had happened?

639
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,380
Is that part of what happened out of, yeah.

640
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,359
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

641
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,920
And I think, again, like just having those conversations.

642
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,700
I had to kind of do a documentary to force me to go and have therapy and to speak

643
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,799
and to open up about feelings and stuff.

644
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,359
Because I don't think without that pressure, I'd have found it easy to do it.

645
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,180
So once I had that kind of pressure, I went and done it.

646
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:12,200
And then I started to be engaged with other people that have been through similar experiences.

647
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,279
Then you've got a lot of questions as to what do you do?

648
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,740
How do I get my kids to open up?

649
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,460
And how do I get my kids on the right path?

650
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,740
So all those conversations are beneficial to me, but then hugely beneficial to my kids.

651
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,059
Yeah, I really appreciate you sharing that because I'm sure there's lots of people that have not maybe seen the documentary

652
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:29,500
that are going through it.

653
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,559
Yeah.

654
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:29,759
Yeah.

655
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:29,779
Yeah.

656
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,880
And to hear where Ferdinand had to sort of find a way and the way that you did is a really compelling story.

657
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,079
I love the We Are 8 story to change gear.

658
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,759
And I love what you're doing.

659
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,200
You're an incredible champion of this world.

660
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,460
And to hear you say you approach that with that same spirit of I want this to be the best.

661
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,220
And Zoe Killar, the founder and CEO, is a remarkable person, a great friend of yours.

662
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,759
I feel like it's one of the huge issues society is facing is the impact of social media on our kids, on a generation.

663
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,160
And for you to be a huge advocate for creating this platform for good, can you share with why it's caught your attention

664
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,940
and why you're so passionate about We Are 8?

665
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:08,599
Yeah.

666
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,259
I just – Zoe, first and foremost, the founder and CEO, she's an incredible lady.

667
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:23,460
I think also the ability to stand side by side with a woman in a world where there aren't loads of tech startup founders who are women

668
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,720
and who find it hard to maybe get investment sometimes, who find it hard to get.

669
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,779
I think also the ability to get traction in that industry, to stand shoulder to shoulder with someone,

670
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:43,799
but not only that, with the platform that you look at and go, well, that is the antidote to a lot of the negativity

671
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,359
that surrounds a lot of other platforms.

672
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:56,059
And it's there, it's alive, it's working, and it solves many a problem that you're thinking, well, how do we solve that?

673
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,240
I've always thought before, how do we stop toxic?

674
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,259
How do we stop negative behavior on social media?

675
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,200
How do we stop negative behavior on social media?

676
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:11,660
How do we stop social media's controlling the algorithm and you seeing what they want you to see?

677
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,599
How do we see our friends again on social media?

678
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,200
Well, We Are 8 has created a platform.

679
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,480
Zoe's created a platform that does that.

680
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:23,319
But not only that, it gives you the opportunity to earn money through the platform.

681
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,220
Money will drop into your account through watching adverts.

682
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,579
But then the great thing is you, as a person,

683
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,599
can then actually have the autonomy to go, right, I want to pay it forward to that charity and help that charity over there and help the environment.

684
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:45,339
So there's so many layers to this that are positive that I was like, after five minutes listening to Zoe when she pitched it to me, I was like, listen, stop.

685
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,180
I don't need no more.

686
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm good.

687
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,119
I've been looking for something like this for a long time.

688
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:53,480
And this isn't a platform where you go, listen, guys, come off of everything else because everything else is terrible.

689
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,039
Yes, there's bad elements to other platforms, but we're saying, come here, just see what's good, what can be done.

690
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,039
And if the right values are at the start and the starting point and the foundations of a platform, this is what it looks like.

691
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,660
Yeah, brilliant.

692
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,059
Check it out if you haven't.

693
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,599
We are right.

694
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,680
It's genius in its simplicity.

695
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:18,960
But as Ro said, it's doing all the things that I think a lot of people are searching for and worth having a look at if you haven't been part of that We Are Right community.

696
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,359
We love the saying, Ro, that success leaves clues.

697
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,099
And I love sitting down with people like you who've had remarkably successful lives.

698
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,819
And we see these patterns that emerge of what great success and leadership.

699
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,819
And we see these patterns that emerge of what great success and leadership stories look like, starting with self-leadership.

700
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:40,380
And I wanted to ask the question, what do you do, Ro, in a busy life with five kids and businesses and you're broadcasting and you've got a lot going on?

701
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,220
What do you do to fill your own cup up so that you can lead the other people in your life?

702
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,940
Go to the gym.

703
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,319
I go to the gym.

704
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Keep active.

705
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,839
Probably three, four times a week I'll go to the gym.

706
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,799
And that hour is like, that's my time.

707
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,839
The way I'm uninterrupted by outside noise or outside responsibilities.

708
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,680
That's my time to do what I want to do.

709
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,140
And family walks.

710
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,039
When we go on a family walk, because I've got five kids, two of them are now living away from home because they're playing football.

711
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,039
But when on the weekends we have the chance where all of us are back in the house, like we had this weekend just gone.

712
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,880
It's just like the house is noisy.

713
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:17,660
It's a mess.

714
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,779
There's things everywhere.

715
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,539
Everything's not in the way it's meant to be.

716
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:22,200
But I love it.

717
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,039
I love the carnage.

718
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,680
So having a loud, happy house is another thing where I can sit back.

719
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:32,220
And go, yeah, this is not long ago I would have dreamed to have this.

720
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,339
And so enjoy it.

721
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:37,059
We think about the impact that people like you have on a daily basis.

722
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,000
What's one thing that's always worked for you as a leader that you would never change about yourself and your style?

723
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,759
I think give the right example.

724
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,140
Set the standards.

725
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,039
Set the example.

726
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,559
And be consistent with it.

727
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:58,759
I think that's always been something that, whether it's been through playing football or through the various companies that I'm involved in, always turn up.

728
00:27:58,819 --> 00:27:59,900
And deliver.

729
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:06,880
And I think that's always the, whether it's, sometimes you might hit the standard that you're looking to and it's the standard you've set the bar at.

730
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,579
But your intentions are always there for that.

731
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,220
And that desire, the dedication, application is unwavering.

732
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:25,500
Ro, in terms of vision, can you tell us a story of a visionary leader that has inspired you along the way and why you felt compelled to follow their vision?

733
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,180
I think.

734
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:30,299
I think it's Alex Ferguson.

735
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,160
I think I had the best leader that I've had, I think, in the Premier League that we've seen.

736
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:40,500
I think in terms of leading men, leading hard people to please, you know.

737
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:53,759
And the way that he would, like I said before, the way that he would kind of give you the space to lead and go out there and believe in who you are.

738
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,740
And I think that we will be successful.

739
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,200
Talking that into existence, we will be successful.

740
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:59,660
We will win.

741
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,240
Listen to me.

742
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,720
Believe in what I'm saying to you.

743
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,160
I won't see you wrong.

744
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:12,339
But also, making sure that you are really understanding that you are here and I believe in you.

745
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,700
I have brought you to this club because I know what you're capable of.

746
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,579
Don't need to change much.

747
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,400
Go out and just do what got you here.

748
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,259
Continue that.

749
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:27,259
And I think a lot of people get kind of twisted a little bit when they go into a new role or the speed at the...

750
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:35,480
The place they work in changes because there's a new vision that they think they automatically have to change what they're doing and change who they are.

751
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:38,539
If you're there and you're being kept there, there's a reason why.

752
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,799
Because you're doing something right.

753
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,160
Until they tell you, you know, you've got to do something different.

754
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,759
Just continue what you're doing and don't feel pressured to actually, oh, I've got to really change.

755
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:53,039
Add bits, yeah, but not a whole outrageous change of approach or the way that you're doing things.

756
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,019
And he was great.

757
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,660
And Sir Alex Rio, over such a long period of time, a continued success.

758
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,819
And winning so regularly.

759
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,660
Did he just stick to that consistently?

760
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,339
He didn't move the needle too much?

761
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,559
He just knew what you're going to get from him?

762
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah.

763
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,119
Sir Alex wasn't massive on tactics.

764
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,640
His coach has done all that stuff.

765
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,279
He was...

766
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,720
What he was great at, and I think that's...

767
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,920
Sorry, that's another thing, part of the first question and the second.

768
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,900
But his ability to treat each and every individual differently and as a separate case.

769
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,140
He didn't have this blanket treatment.

770
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,180
Managers were like, one size fits all.

771
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm going to approach everybody the same because I ain't got enough time in a day to deal with you individually.

772
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,119
He would be very much, listen, guys, right, you.

773
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,680
This is how I'll deal with you.

774
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,279
I'll be very aggressive because I know that you can take it and your response will be a positive one.

775
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Or he needs an arm around the shoulder.

776
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,539
He might need me to joke a bit more.

777
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,180
He might need me to soften up.

778
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,660
You know, everybody had a different approach.

779
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,180
He never praised me once, really, to my face.

780
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,279
Very, very rare that he praised me and the Mania Vidic.

781
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,579
But he probably thought, well, if I praise Rio too much, you might get a bit too confident

782
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,619
and think things are just, you can chill out a bit.

783
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,519
Where I was always on my edge of my seat wanting to go, listen,

784
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,940
aching for that bit of kind of encouragement or go to the press and talk about us defenders a little bit.

785
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,880
He never done that and he kept us hungry.

786
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,220
Rio, curiosity is a word we see a lot in people that have continued success and sustained success.

787
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:28,119
How do you carve out time to be curious and then integrate that into your day?

788
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,640
Is that something?

789
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,359
That resonates with you?

790
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,900
Yeah, I'm crazy curious.

791
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,819
I'm so curious that I end up signing up to so much stuff that is just way beyond what I should be.

792
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:37,880
My wife goes crazy.

793
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,599
A new business, a new idea because I'm so curious about, it's like AI.

794
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm so like curious about AI now and I'm just like downloading every, all the chat GPT and all this stuff

795
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,480
and just kind of just getting into it and seeing how it works.

796
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,980
And yeah, I can't help it.

797
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,400
Something comes on the system.

798
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,880
And I'm like, well, I don't want, I don't want to be in a conversation where I'm way off it.

799
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,119
I want a little bit of an understanding at least.

800
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,920
Rio, have you got an example of a great collaboration in your life you can share with us?

801
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:08,980
In what sense?

802
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,799
Yeah, we're just obsessed with the idea of people collaborating on passion projects

803
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,440
or things that have worked well for them where they've gone and reached out with different people.

804
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,380
And that greater sum of a couple of people getting together has been a story of success.

805
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,200
Yeah, I think two people.

806
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,160
I think Zoe Collar from We Are Right.

807
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,180
I think her positivity.

808
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,859
I think her energy lights up every room she goes into, whether it's on a Zoom call or in face.

809
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:44,079
Just her appetite for work and for breaking down barriers in an industry where a lot of people will go,

810
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,059
okay, well, it's quite a saturated market.

811
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,500
There's a couple of platforms that have got an absolute stranglehold on it.

812
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,519
It's impenetrable, but she looks at it very differently because of the foundations

813
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,359
and the values of what she's built.

814
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,779
And being super confident in that and unwavering.

815
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,380
She's been great in being alongside her for that.

816
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,759
And yeah, a guy called Saul Klein.

817
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,279
He has a fund in the tech world.

818
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,099
And as I said, when my wife passed them years ago, I was obviously in a bit of a lost soul

819
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,279
and I needed to be out and working while the kids were at school.

820
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,420
And he used to have like a dragon's den on a Monday.

821
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,380
Every Monday.

822
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,819
Every Monday of startups coming and pitching him their ideas and stuff.

823
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:33,559
And he said, just come in.

824
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,839
Cause I met him at a web summit and I'm interested in tech anyway.

825
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,960
Never really had my foot anywhere.

826
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,240
And he said, come in and just sit in the corner and just take it and see where you're at.

827
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,220
And you might invest in things.

828
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,059
You might not, whatever.

829
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,599
And I might throw a few questions.

830
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,740
And he just started throwing questions at me every now and again.

831
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,299
I just think, what does he want with me?

832
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,259
I don't even know this world.

833
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,740
And he's like, listen, a different perspective is always needed.

834
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:55,819
Doesn't matter where you are.

835
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm in a bubble of tech.

836
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,019
Like having you here for that is great.

837
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,160
So that collaboration of me giving something to him,

838
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,180
but also me learning so much in terms of investment and how and who and what and why

839
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,059
in terms of investing was like huge for me in those formative years

840
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,099
of understanding a little bit of investment in tech.

841
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,980
It's a brilliant story.

842
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,699
And we love that idea of, as you said,

843
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,139
a sports person sitting in a room with a tech entrepreneur,

844
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,000
but the way your minds think being the sum of the greater parts

845
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,639
being such a worthwhile thing to achieve.

846
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,800
You mentioned communication being a real strength of yours as a young,

847
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,400
leader and your managers and senior people saw that in you.

848
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,519
Have you got a mantra that you've lived by in terms of your communication?

849
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,340
Yeah, I think it's direct,

850
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,559
but don't put too much words on someone's plate where it becomes confusing.

851
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,079
I think I always felt as a young person,

852
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,099
if someone said too much and brought too many things to the table at once,

853
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,039
I lost the focus of what I'm actually doing.

854
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,820
And I'm concentrating on something that's not really going to make me a better player.

855
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,679
It's going to only confuse me and distort.

856
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,659
A lot of the things I'm going into so clear lines of communication,

857
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:05,500
getting the message across with real clarity and transparency.

858
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,619
Um, also with respect, um, there, there's a couple of,

859
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,119
I think the imperative and what they see in me.

860
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:14,639
Definitely.

861
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
Well, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

862
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:23,480
I'd have to say my mom and dad really, um, just for one thing that again,

863
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,559
like one more thing on your question before is that if you're going to talk to a group of

864
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:27,860
people,

865
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,780
or talk to teammates and,

866
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,119
and,

867
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,840
and challenge teammates,

868
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,639
you got to make sure that your house is in order.

869
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,440
I've always felt that as well.

870
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,960
There's no way I can give advice or say,

871
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,579
you can't do that or you shouldn't do that.

872
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:46,239
I'll come down on someone when I'm late every day or I'm letting things pass or drift in my routine.

873
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,559
So I have to be on it to be able to have the conversations that you have as a leader.

874
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:52,699
Um, yeah,

875
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:53,260
my mom and dad,

876
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,760
I think will be the people that I look to because they've had something that has been an imprint in

877
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,519
my life and stuck with me forever and will do.

878
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,539
I'm sure to the day I die,

879
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:02,500
which is a work ethic.

880
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,099
My mom worked all the hours God sent to give us the opportunity to have food on the table or travel

881
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,000
from A to B.

882
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,900
Um, same with my dad traveled from one part of London,

883
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,280
go to the other work,

884
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,900
come back to our part of London,

885
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,840
then travel to another part of London to take us to training three,

886
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,800
four times a week.

887
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,659
Um, that again,

888
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,519
not telling me anything,

889
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,300
but just doing it.

890
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,639
And me seeing that is something that I,

891
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,579
I haven't imprinted in my life now and work ethic is something that I don't think anybody could doubt when they,

892
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:34,519
when they talk about me.

893
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:35,320
Rio,

894
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,960
we're a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration.

895
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,280
I love the story you just told about Saul Klein and you getting together and learning the tech world through him.

896
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,260
You've got access to people all around the globe through what you've achieved in sport.

897
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,159
If you looked and thought,

898
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:50,800
geez,

899
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,820
I'd love to connect or collaborate with that person on one of the passion projects you're involved in.

900
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,400
Is there a name that springs to mind?

901
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,159
That you've always thought of if you're thinking about impacts and shifting an industry or shifting the volume of people,

902
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,820
Cristiano Ronaldo is the man on the planet to do it.

903
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,440
You've seen what he's done.

904
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,159
We just opened his own new social media channel.

905
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,199
YouTube gone crazy,

906
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,639
broke every record possible,

907
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,719
um,

908
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:27,619
for a project that will be around helping and the wellbeing of other people to get someone like him on board to do that,

909
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,119
I think,

910
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,980
it's definitely a definite blue sky thinking where you go.

911
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,599
I'd love to have him because he,

912
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,699
there aren't many people in the world that have as many followers as him,

913
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:43,059
but could also who also have the ear of all those followers.

914
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,739
There's a lot of people with a lot of followers,

915
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,480
but I think when they say something,

916
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,719
there's no real meaning behind it.

917
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,699
No one really moves.

918
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,239
This guy has the ability to move cultures and people,

919
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:52,539
man.

920
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,280
It's just like of all age groups,

921
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,239
of all demographics.

922
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:55,780
It's just,

923
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,360
I've seen it with my own eyes.

924
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,619
It's crazy.

925
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,059
So yeah,

926
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,599
that would be the one.

927
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,360
And Rio,

928
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,559
final question.

929
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,280
I've got to go back on Cristiano.

930
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,039
I think he scored his 901st goal this week was in the news more than anyone in the history of the sport that you love.

931
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,800
You got to see him as a young,

932
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,679
young kid.

933
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,400
Was there a genius at that age?

934
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,619
Did you realise you're with something special?

935
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,480
And how do you rate him in terms of what other great players have achieved?

936
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,559
I think in terms of talent,

937
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,900
I don't think there's any other question.

938
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,940
I think we all thought immediately when we laid eyes on him,

939
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,739
wow,

940
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,719
wonder kid can do anything.

941
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,320
It could be anything he wants to be.

942
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,400
No one really saw him scoring 900 goals.

943
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,519
I think he'd be,

944
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,039
everyone would be lying if they heard he said,

945
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,400
oh yeah,

946
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,960
get 900 goals because he wasn't a goal scorer when he first came.

947
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,539
He was an entertainer,

948
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:45,699
but he almost,

949
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,300
it's like what he's done in the game of football is almost akin to changing a sport.

950
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,179
Almost.

951
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,920
He went from an entertainer to being just an out and out goal scorer,

952
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,340
changed positions totally.

953
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,480
So,

954
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,780
to be honest,

955
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:55,840
I don't know.

956
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:55,900
I don't know.

957
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:55,960
I don't know.

958
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,019
I don't know.

959
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:56,059
I don't know.

960
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:56,079
I don't know.

961
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,119
I don't know.

962
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:56,619
I don't know.

963
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,380
So to think that he's actually become one of the best in the world as a winger,

964
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,360
entertaining,

965
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,380
and then went on from there and became even better as a number nine striker,

966
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
he's changed,

967
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:09,960
changed his roles completely.

968
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,960
People find it hard to have one great career.

969
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,320
He's had two in one career in that sense.

970
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,300
So that then takes me to the thing I think that sets him apart from everybody else.

971
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,179
His intelligence.

972
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,019
He has a huge intelligence and an appetite to evolve and to be curious.

973
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:26,119
Like,

974
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,300
he said that word again of finding the margins.

975
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,900
Where are the margins at in terms of researching sleep,

976
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,579
researching physiotherapy,

977
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:41,960
researching setting the ambience in a room with crystals like he does mad stuff.

978
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,440
He's got like he's he's talking to NASA like about recovery.

979
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Like there ain't many players that are doing that.

980
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
It's funny.

981
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:49,960
I mean,

982
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,420
he's looking for the extra extra margins to not only better himself,

983
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,960
but obviously look at the length of time.

984
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,139
He's played football at the top is we've not seen this before.

985
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:00,199
We haven't seen it.

986
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,860
And he's groundbreaking in that sense.

987
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,340
And in terms of goats that have ever played the game,

988
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,380
he's 100% in at the top table with whoever you want to put there.

989
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:09,900
Rio,

990
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,000
it's been a great privilege to spend some time with you today and find out more about your story.

991
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,460
Um,

992
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:14,719
you know,

993
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,960
we are right to an incredible legacy along with everything else that you've got in your life.

994
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,719
And you can see where the patterns are for remarkable success and really appreciate you taking the time.

995
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,940
Be great to cross over with you.

996
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,079
In the leader world.

997
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,300
And thanks for taking the time.

998
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,019
We really appreciate it.

999
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,800
Top man.

1000
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,619
Thank you very much.

1001
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:31,840
And I'll be back on soon.

1002
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,480
I've missed a couple,

1003
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,239
but I'll be back on.

1004
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,780
Don't worry.

1005
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,420
We'll look forward to that.

1006
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,920
Thanks for it.

1007
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,519
Great to see it.

1008
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:36,860
Cheers,

1009
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,079
mate.

1010
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,519
No problem.

1011
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:37,920
Really good.

1012
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,420
Enjoyed it.
