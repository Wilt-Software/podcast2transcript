1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,930
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:09,830
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,589
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,449
passion of mine.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,510
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and I've had the privilege

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,050
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts that have helped

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,710
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,270
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:53,960
I was joined by the creative genius that is Rob Sitch from Working Dog.

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,560
We chat about how to lead an entire film crew on set, changing career paths and the benefits

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,060
of failing.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,920
Now, one of the real challenges in sitting down to chat with Rob Sitch is the overwhelming

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,920
feeling of underachievement in your own life and that's what I've had in preparation for

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,640
this conversation.

15
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:16,659
Rob, a graduate of the University of Melbourne in 1987 with a Bachelor of Medicine in Surgery

16
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,400
and instead of pursuing a career in medicine, Rob's path has led him to be a game changer

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,420
and a game changer.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,299
He started universally as a world-class comedian, actor and legendary director.

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,459
Rob's collaboration with the team at Working Dog has produced some of the most successful,

20
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,700
iconic and culturally defining moments in Australian television, film and radio history.

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,180
Starting in 1986, The Degeneration, The Late Show, Frontline, Funky Squad, The Panel, Thank

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,060
God You're Here, Have You Been Paying Attention, Utopia, The Castle, The Dish and many, many

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,439
more other mediums, books, radio, extraordinary career of success.

24
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,159
And Rob, it's always a great pleasure to catch up with you.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Thanks for your time.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,799
It's always great to catch up with you, Luke.

27
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,560
Now, I want to start as a 17-year-old, you're at Melbourne Uni as a medical student.

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,400
By the time you're in your early 20s, I understand you were running the emergency department

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,340
at the Wangaratta Hospital.

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,859
You can correct me if I'm wrong.

31
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,919
How did that set you up for life?

32
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,180
There's two elements to that.

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:18,240
One is, it still surprises me that you used to finish your year 12 quite young back then.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,379
I was young for my year and we finished young.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,300
And so, I started university, I often say this, I was doing medicine at 17, I mean, surely

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,919
the state of Victoria should have stepped in and put me into that.

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,620
And then I took, I have my medical career, I took a couple of years off to do various

38
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,500
comedy projects.

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:48,439
And so, I arrived maybe after my degree took eight years, so maybe I was 24, 23, I arrived

40
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,319
at Wangaratta and used to be rotated up there.

41
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,139
And to say I was running it, I was somewhere between the doctor and the work experience

42
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:58,479
kid.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,360
But that's a great thing to be rotated up to the country.

44
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,180
I joined the local aero club, the local tennis club.

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,960
It was probably, it was sort of October, November, December, beautiful weather in the country.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
It was just the best time.

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,319
I understand that you delivered plenty of babies along the way.

48
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,300
And you're still in your early 20s though, right?

49
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,319
Yeah.

50
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,000
And, you know, an emergency department of the hospitals got some unique challenges attached

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to it.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,099
Do you feel like that did set you on a path?

53
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:37,000
I was literally only saying last night that I look back and I can't, it sort of feels

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,400
like a different person doing that stuff.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,439
The country is different because someone came in and said they've hurt their back in a rodeo.

56
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,539
All right, okay, well that's only in the country.

57
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:54,860
But it was, I've done all the, fortunately I got up there, but it was at the end of the

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,659
stint and I got up there as, you know, the nursing staff were enormously supportive.

59
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:04,300
There was, you know, every known specialist consultant hanging over in another part of

60
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,360
the building in an ICU to back everyone up.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,620
So it was, you know, lots of, you know, cuts and sprains and all sorts of things like that.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,259
But I really enjoyed the practical side of medicine, you know, doing, stitching up cuts

63
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,540
and any sort of procedure.

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Yeah.

65
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,600
And still to this day, you know, I remember putting in IV lines.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
It's a really funny thing.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,379
You get a knack and a great sense of satisfaction when you get good at something like that.

68
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,920
Not so much fun when someone's not good at that, from my experience, Rob, either.

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,199
Well, you know, the funny thing is it's interesting you raise that because even after all these

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,860
years I was, I was actually on a stint at Albury and this wonderful gentleman came in,

71
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:57,879
and he was, he had a blood cancer from being, from memory being involved in one of the atomic

72
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,779
tests in, the British atomic tests in Australia.

73
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,939
And that was the assertion, I think, in a given time where we think that's the answer.

74
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:14,420
And I went up to put in an IV line and for once in my life, I failed the first time.

75
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,920
And, and this is a gentleman who had it a hundred times and had learned to dread it

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,819
by now.

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,019
And I tried it again and failed again, eventually.

78
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:27,139
And the consultant came up to me after and said, I think I'll do it next time.

79
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,079
And he'd obviously, and I just, of all the people you didn't want to let down, I'd walked

80
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,360
in as, leave it to me.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,620
And you go, oh, and it's funny what sticks in your mind, I've never forgotten letting

82
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
that guy down.

83
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,420
I can remember, you know, having various operations through, through footy and, and the IV drip

84
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,980
goes in and, and you often get the, whoever's on the wards, oh, good news, you know, Rob's

85
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,860
here today.

86
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,100
It's going to be a pain free one for you.

87
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,920
I always felt that set up a fair bit of pressure for the person that was trying to do that.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,879
Well, hey, I want to go back to, hear a lot about the Melbourne University reviews and,

89
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,199
and where you probably started your creative performing and, and career in some, in some

90
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,199
ways.

91
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,199
Can you, can you take me back to there?

92
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,759
You're a medical student, you're performing in the reviews at university.

93
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,100
Was there a clear time where you thought, hey, I'm going down the creative path here rather

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
than the medical path?

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,259
No, there wasn't because I didn't do any, you know, this acting at all until I was maybe

96
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,259
21, something.

97
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,740
I didn't do it at school, had no interest the first year, second year, but it occurred

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,939
to me, you know, university is a time when if you don't roll the dice on a few things

99
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,279
that are going to make you nervous, you probably never will.

100
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,439
So, and my football career had pulled a hamstring, I think it's fair to say.

101
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,439
So I went, oh, look, I'll, I'll try out for the, you know, one of the college players.

102
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,439
And I was like, oh, I'm going to try out for the, you know, one of the college players.

103
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,439
Yeah.

104
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,439
And it wasn't even considered.

105
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:57,839
And then tried it again the next year and I was, my role was to do the sound effects

106
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,839
on stage.

107
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,839
And I thought, I felt even as a, as a newbie, I felt that was beneath me.

108
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,740
And then a friend of mine who was doing medicine said, how about we try it for this law review?

109
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,300
And I didn't even think we were eligible.

110
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:17,439
And so we auditioned and got in, but it turned out the director had the heart of gold and

111
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,439
basically took in everything.

112
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,439
Everyone that auditioned.

113
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,120
So we had a cast of 60 at one point.

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,839
We had our own ballet about halfway through the second act in order to give everyone a

115
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,839
job.

116
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,100
But I, I love that.

117
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,139
I just went, oh God, it's like, it's, it's like a sporting team, but it was, it's co-ed

118
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,560
for a start, which helps.

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,360
And it was just a really, really enjoyable time.

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,439
And then we did it next year and then someone said, look, let's take a year off and tour

121
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,439
it around the country.

122
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,839
And so it's back then.

123
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:55,459
Well, look, it's, it's, you had no obligations to speak of, and I had a wonderful, the Dean

124
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,240
of Medicine at Royal Melbourne Hospital at the time, a guy called Dr. Roger Mellick.

125
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,839
You know, I went in, I thought he was going to talk me out of it and the opposite.

126
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,879
He said, oh, that sounds, that sounds really interesting.

127
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,879
I'd do that.

128
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,240
I thought you were going to straighten me out.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,600
He goes, oh no, that sounds like a lot of fun.

130
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,560
I'd grab that if you can.

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,240
And so that's, you know, biff.

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,920
You know, sliding doors, had he said, oh no, I don't think that's right, I wouldn't have

133
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
done it.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,800
What a great piece of advice, isn't it, Rob?

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
That's unique, isn't it?

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,360
To go to someone that you're expecting to talk you out of, which is a pretty risky move

137
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,899
and you're on the path and you end up finishing your medicine and surgery, as you said, eight

138
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,899
years of study.

139
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,580
But how did that decision go down with the family when you said, I'm taking you off and

140
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm touring our show around the country?

141
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
I reckon a few raised eyebrows.

142
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,039
I think I had a father who made a decision, I'm never going to tell you what to do.

143
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,120
But I reckon that he was about to play his joker that day, he went.

144
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,919
Because you know, going back a few generations, our, my sort of generation, sort of everyone

145
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:09,279
started going to university, but you know, my dad and his brother and sister and their

146
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,440
generation before them, the university was such a big deal.

147
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,039
So when you got the opportunity and, you know, I think from memory.

148
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,139
It was, the government didn't charge for uni when we were there.

149
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,120
So it was looking a gift horse in the mouth in his eyes.

150
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,159
And Rob, you mentioned the director at the Melbourne Uni Review having a heart of gold

151
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,659
and opening the door and allowing you through at the start.

152
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:33,980
And I wanted to delve into that because I've, I've spoken to a few people in preparation

153
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,320
who are close to you and they talk about your brilliance in acting and your natural brilliance

154
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,700
in comedy, but it's the extraordinary gift they see for you when you're a director and

155
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,419
in that particular role.

156
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,419
Can you explain that?

157
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,240
How have you gone about the craft of directing and, and what sort of skillset have you brought

158
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
to it?

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,039
We, we, it's an interesting evolution for us.

160
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,179
We decided really early on, realised really early on that, that everything in comedy is

161
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,179
writing.

162
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:10,919
So, you know, you might write a film like Die Hard, a suspense thriller that you can

163
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,919
hand it over to director and, and there's a bit of wriggle room to how you shoot it

164
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,919
and how.

165
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,580
You can, how you edit it and the music and all that.

166
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:27,720
With comedy, the timing and the, and the way that the lines are delivered are so specific

167
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,440
that you, in a way, directing was a way of protecting the writing and acting was a way

168
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,179
of protecting the writing.

169
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,679
And even then we got to the point where we started buying, back in the day, it was very

170
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:44,220
expensive editing machines and we used to buy them in order to edit it the way it was,

171
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,759
the way we heard it.

172
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,759
And so in a way with comedy, you know, you can write music and then hand it over to the

173
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,759
orchestra.

174
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,480
In, in comedy, you've got to write the music and learn how to play the instruments and

175
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,519
then get out the front and conductor as well, I think is the best way of explaining.

176
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,519
Yeah.

177
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,639
It's fascinating, you know, insight into that.

178
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,039
And I, I, as I said, I was talking to people close to you and, and they were going back

179
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:12,440
to, as an example with The Dish, you know, in 2000, unbelievable film and an incredible

180
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
success.

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,600
And, and sort of picturing you on set with over a hundred people.

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Yeah.

183
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
And every one of those hundred really want to take their pulse from what you say.

184
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,879
And they're, everyone wants a little bit of your time, but you've got all these pressures

185
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,639
of time and you've got pressures of weather and you've got actors who need your direction

186
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,639
as well.

187
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,360
You've got the telescope in that example that someone had booked.

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
And I think you've got, you know, every hotel booked in the town.

189
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,539
It's a lot of things coming at your way as, as, as, as the director and the, and the leader

190
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,539
in that example.

191
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:45,039
But they always talked about your sense of calm and your empathy for the actors and everyone

192
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,039
on set.

193
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,759
Was that a natural thing for you or is that something you've really thought about and

194
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,759
developed?

195
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,919
It's funny you say, it's funny when we were up using the Parkes radio telescope, which

196
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,460
is one of the largest in the world, I remember we, we, I, we had to finish one day because

197
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,200
a German radio astronomer had flown out to Australia to track a black hole.

198
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,120
And I don't think he was in the mood to be pushed back.

199
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
I, I, I don't think.

200
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,600
I think it's, directing is interesting.

201
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I remember my father seemed to, you know, he loved being, you know, being in charge

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,559
of things and captain of things and all that.

203
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,820
And I said, I once asked him, I said, why, why, why, why is that streak in you?

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
And he said, I don't know.

205
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,240
I just really love organising fellas.

206
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,740
And I thought, oh, that's interesting.

207
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
He enjoyed it.

208
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,120
And I went, that's not me, but directing is really interesting because there's a goal.

209
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,039
And so therefore it's not that I enjoy the organisation of people because a film set,

210
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,679
it's amazing the way numbers explode and the trucks explode and all those sorts of things.

211
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,759
And when you drive up, you go, holy hell, I've got to run that thing.

212
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,240
But there's always a goal with a movie, you know, and in some ways, the great thing about

213
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,000
film sets is, is they're the closest thing to a military operation.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,419
Everyone's got a title.

215
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,799
Everyone knows their job.

216
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,980
Everyone knows their role.

217
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,960
No one salutes and says, yes, sir, no, sir, but it's like that.

218
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
The professionalism is really high.

219
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:13,639
Yeah.

220
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,799
So there's, there's not a great level of uncertainty.

221
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:24,899
So you've got to make decisions, but the support mechanisms are there, the planning's there.

222
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,240
It's a, it's a really, it's a really great system that's been worked out of, you know,

223
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,879
over, over a century now, but it's often the thing I did enjoy was the goal, but it's funny

224
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,879
where you were talking about Wangaratta Hospital.

225
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,480
When I was in the emergency one day, a local guy that used to come in and consult the emergency

226
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,080
department.

227
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,320
He told me something.

228
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,879
He said, when you're at your most stressed, put your hands behind your back and leave

229
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,879
them there.

230
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,879
And I went, what?

231
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,840
And he goes, just do it.

232
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,419
Trust me.

233
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,440
And what he was saying was, there's no point getting into tears.

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,840
There's no point flapping your arms around, is just, just be still for a second.

235
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,840
And I think directing's a bit like that.

236
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,960
It's, there's a million opportunities to just freak out.

237
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:21,440
And say, oh, for whips sake, would everyone shut up and stop asking me questions?

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,759
And that doesn't get you anywhere.

239
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,539
And so I think once you go the other way, it actually becomes enjoyable in its own way,

240
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:32,059
is that you can be in the most stressed, most severe, and someone comes and says, there's

241
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:37,720
no, there's no iceberg lettuce for your lunch and you're going, okay, well, that's changed

242
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
to ridicio.

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Okay.

244
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,460
That's, there's funny stories about great directors.

245
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,759
Better than me.

246
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,080
Better than me, who, you know, in the middle of organizing the Gandy shoot with a hundred

247
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,259
thousand extras, where someone comes up and asks some completely trivial questions.

248
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,519
And I remember reading a story and you just can't break the faith of being disciplined.

249
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a, it's a great insight, isn't it?

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,360
If your hands are behind your back, then you naturally, I suppose your, your body language

251
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,519
changes into a calmer, calmer sense.

252
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
And it's fascinating.

253
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,220
That's carried over from your medical world into, into directing on set.

254
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,700
You hear occasionally, Rob, leaked audio off a movie set where an actor's going.

255
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,399
Absolutely ballistic and, and, you know, some emotional tantrums and were film sets

256
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,379
historically a bit like the old footy clubs that we grew up in, where there was a lot

257
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:29,059
of yelling and a lot of, that was the way you got your way through, or was your approach

258
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:30,639
a bit unique for its time?

259
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,220
How, how would you view that?

260
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,799
I reckon most film sets by the time we arrived were pretty, pretty sane places and pretty

261
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,039
disciplined places.

262
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,080
And there's, it's funny in Australia, I think, you know, the no dickhead rule that we're,

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,419
the Sydney Swans made famous, I reckon that that's a bit of a cultural thing in Australia

264
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,320
is that you can get angry for great reason, but you can't get angry because you're a prima

265
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
donna.

266
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I don't think that, I think that that's, does not go down well at all in this country.

267
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
No, it's a good, that is a good insight into a part of our culture.

268
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,580
I think we should celebrate, isn't it, as that tends to work its way through pretty

269
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
quickly.

270
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,059
I wanted to just talk about your collaboration.

271
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,059
It's quite unique.

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,720
Rob, effectively, after medicine, all your working life has been with the working dog

273
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,980
team and Santo Cholaro, Tom Gleisner, Michael Hirsch, Jane Kennedy, your beautiful wife,

274
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,440
of course, was part of that.

275
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,580
To really have one group you've worked with all the way through seems to be an amazing

276
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
achievement.

277
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,320
Is that good luck, good design, or how do you equate that success over such a long period

278
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
of time?

279
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I reckon luck is very underestimated as a factor in all our lives.

280
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I reckon.

281
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,779
I describe my career as the hobby that got out of hand and it didn't start as a big plan.

282
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:56,039
I look at the current young generation and you can see them, they're quite methodical

283
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,360
about looking forward.

284
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,639
You don't get the footballer out of the country at 22 who goes, oh, I just turned up at Carlton

285
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,259
and I played 180 games.

286
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,019
People are plotting these things from a very young age.

287
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,880
I wasn't like that at all and I don't think we were like that.

288
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,640
It was one project to one project.

289
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:23,299
Once we sort of formed a group and a team, I think we fully expected eventually everyone

290
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:36,599
to slowly leave and suddenly your Ringo Starr doing a drum solo for a charity gig.

291
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,880
But I think we're all sort of ... I think what we ended up valuing ... and this is a

292
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,839
gone for every project.

293
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,960
When you have a project you think it's a really great idea, the one thing you learn really

294
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,279
quickly is there's a big dip after the initial fun.

295
00:17:53,279 --> 00:18:00,660
It often takes a lot of pilots, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of hard work that can end up in tears.

296
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:07,099
We sort of worked out that we didn't want to do a project by ourselves generally.

297
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,059
When we'd raise it, we'd all look at each other to see if ... It's a bit like turning

298
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,640
the keys to the nuclear weapon.

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,259
You want it ... Everyone's got a key and unless they all turn, we're not going forward.

300
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:24,420
I think possibly we ended up enjoying the collaboration and that no one wanted to go

301
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,019
out and do their solo album.

302
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:31,599
I heard someone describe great partnerships recently as you need shared vision, shared

303
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,819
values and complementary capabilities.

304
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,519
Does that resonate with your group?

305
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,599
You have to line up on certain things and your skill sets are complementary.

306
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,599
Is that sort of what ...?

307
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,599
Yeah.

308
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:49,839
You sort of find out you're good ... A couple of us are better at this and better at that.

309
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,519
Instinctively, I always like directing because I like preparing and I liked having everything

310
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,799
in my head.

311
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,319
It's almost like it's a job where you can say to somebody, to everyone else, leave it

312
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,319
with me.

313
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,720
I can get this done and we don't need ... All of us don't need to drive ourselves crazy

314
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
doing it.

315
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah.

316
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,079
But Jalaro, who I work with, will often say, leave the editing to me, I'll do all the editing

317
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:23,839
and you just know that he'll probably put 50% more time in that's necessary but 5% of

318
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,220
that is quite necessary.

319
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Yeah.

320
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,420
You're just never sure which bit is ... Actually, funnily, he's got an Italian saying, I can't

321
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,599
remember in Italian, but something like, the superfluous things are often the most necessary.

322
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,599
Yeah.

323
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,599
I reckon, when you play to your strengths ... When you're doing something, you're doing something,

324
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,599
you're doing something that's not right.

325
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,420
when you're doing something in your strength you're happy to go that extra mile and that's

326
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,400
that little bit of to what to someone else it might look superfluous but it's part of the

327
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,259
superfluous ends up being you know quite important and rob do you guys have sort of structure or or

328
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,759
rules around that collaboration it's as you said for your whole working life effectively it's been

329
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:09,119
such a success are you guys just go with the flow and and it's worked out it's a bit like that jane

330
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,119
you know the james bond seat with the ejector seat you know we but we sit in the ejector seat

331
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:21,240
we've got the right to eject ourselves like everyone knows if at any at any moment all of

332
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,099
us can bail if we want to um and outside of that there's only enough only enough there's there's not

333
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:37,160
many rules because the collaboration you know if we do a script it's we do 10 drafts of it so

334
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,099
if the fifth draft you're not

335
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:44,799
looking for you for the others to go that's brilliant fantastic it's um you're fully

336
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,920
expecting i call you to call them dental appointments because you don't go to the

337
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,640
dentist to have fun you go along you're saying mate i know i've got problems fix them

338
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:03,200
and i sort of uh and i sometimes when people yeah you know younger people come and show something

339
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,759
and they're showing it because they want positive affirmation and sometimes i've got to go that's

340
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,079
great

341
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:15,180
great but now you've got to get used to the the 360 degree feedback yeah and you guys were

342
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,900
comfortable with that early on to just say we're not precious about about something we've written

343
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:27,819
or no no because you get very sensitive to you're looking around and you and you're seeing people go

344
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:35,279
yeah yeah like the feeling of a great friend who you trust and admire being underwhelmed isn't

345
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,799
it it's a it's a sobering experience

346
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:43,339
and you can add another layer to that partnership rob because you you married the beautiful jane

347
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:47,859
kennedy which comes out of that collaboration at the start of my you know working with your wife

348
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:52,559
and and partner and your beautiful five kids as well did that change the dynamic was that

349
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,759
did you have to think of i'm sure it did in some ways but um clearly it has uh provided

350
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:04,519
enormous success as well it does i mean kids change everything i you know i think we all know

351
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,079
it but we know it going into it um and we we sort of get reminded of it and we sort of get reminded of it

352
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:15,420
during it and then looking back you're going boy it changes a lot so your outside life changes a bit

353
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,940
you know i was used to love fishing and golf and whatever and as i said that pulls the hamstring

354
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,740
pretty quickly um but but work we've kept we've sort of kept i think the smartest thing we did

355
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,680
early on was we got an office and if you've got an office it means you can you can run away from

356
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,420
your responsibilities

357
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,079
i want to talk about lots of areas i want to talk about lots of areas i want to talk about lots of areas

358
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:44,779
about your hobbies of uh of fish and golf and a few other things in a moment as well but i love

359
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:49,319
the opportunity to catch up with you from time to time and i tend to fire parenting questions your

360
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,220
way rob because it doesn't feel like there aren't many forums to do that i've enjoyed having

361
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,440
this longer form format because you know the leadership of business and family life always

362
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,900
seems to cross over and uh and i do quote one of your uh sayings you passed on there's a daniel

363
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,539
patrick monaghan quote that you shared with me once the richest inheritance any child can have

364
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:08,839
is a

365
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,480
stable loving disciplined family life it resonated with me and and my food do you think we share

366
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,099
enough uh you know parenting tips it doesn't seem as though we uh get together and do that often

367
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:25,980
enough as a as a community i don't think we guys aren't good at it for various reasons but i think

368
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:33,480
one of them is i don't think fathers quite i don't quite understand what role what the secret

369
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,700
source is in what we do like you know from the studies that that fathers are incredibly

370
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,079
important

371
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:45,839
um but you think you think unless you teach your kid you know how to change the motor in a in a

372
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:52,380
station wagon you go i haven't taught my kid enough but i sort of i've come to the conclusion

373
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,299
that it's all the tiny moments you know it's a bit that daniel patrick monaghan was a very very

374
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:03,960
smart man a senator he was the senate seat that hillary clinton took over from and he was a he

375
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,660
was a scientist by by training in a way he was like an epidemiologist of sorts

376
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:14,700
and at the end of all this sort of science he came to that very really simple conclusion is that

377
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,319
you know giving kids a stable loving upbringing and so i sort of think at the end of it um

378
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,099
uh i i thought one of my kids was going to take up fishing or golf or something

379
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,539
but i sort of comfort myself with the fact that that quote's probably the key

380
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,559
yeah it resonates certainly with with me and i've spoken to you before and you

381
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,740
about those parenting moments we all have them where you just i've had a bit of a shocker there

382
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,079
you know in terms of you know i've had a bit of a shocker there and i've had a bit of a shocker there

383
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,720
I lost my cool or I didn't get that one right.

384
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,180
And your reassuring words have always sat with me.

385
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,460
It's like, hey, you're there.

386
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,359
The fact that you spend enough time and you care and you think about it,

387
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,960
that sort of first, second and third has been your thoughts.

388
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,519
Is that still the case?

389
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,039
Totally does.

390
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,039
It's funny you say this.

391
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,279
I hope he doesn't mind me saying this.

392
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:01,619
Once a year I have a little golf trip and one of the people

393
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,920
we play with is Jonathan Brown and a bit like you, superstar AFL player,

394
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,880
but captain and all.

395
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,000
And one of the things I look forward to every year is I talk

396
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,740
to him about parenting.

397
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,119
I think he enjoys it too.

398
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,700
We scratch our heads and we go, what did you do then?

399
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,519
And you think we'd be talking about the glories of Lee Matthews

400
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,960
and the premierships and we end up going, jeez, it's hard, isn't it?

401
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,240
It's funny, isn't it?

402
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,779
For all the things you do, it is right at the top of the tree, isn't it?

403
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,599
And no perfect answer to get it right.

404
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,859
Segueing from that.

405
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,339
Rob, I spoke to you about a passion, which is really the genesis

406
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:46,980
for this chat and leadership podcast that we're talking on in the work

407
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,900
that we've been doing in a business called A Leader and you've met

408
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,400
a great friend of mine, Matt Wadowitz, and you formed a collaboration,

409
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
which I spoke to you about, and you were generous enough

410
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,619
to be part of it.

411
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,900
But I don't think I actually told you fully the real story of that

412
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,500
because it was Marcus Bondempelli, a 25-year-old captain of the Bulldogs,

413
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,440
quite an extraordinary young leader, and he came and heard about the fact

414
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,700
that there were these groups getting together and he really had you in mind

415
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,359
as someone he wanted to collaborate with, which I thought was brilliant.

416
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,859
You know, at that age, I wish I could think like that at that age

417
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,720
or even this stage of your life.

418
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,980
And Pat Cummings and Andy Lee, who's Pat Cummings' Australian cricket superstar,

419
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,819
Andy Lee, who's just a champion of a person and an incredible success story

420
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,180
in everything that he's done, Andy Lee.

421
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,779
So can you tell me about that group and what it's been like?

422
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,579
Well, it's been wonderful because I think everyone approaches these things

423
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:41,299
and it's interesting.

424
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,460
I'll go back to films.

425
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,500
One of the curious things when you do a lot of directing is the one thing

426
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,740
you keep asking actors is, you know, is, oh, what's that director like?

427
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,380
And I remember speaking to Sam Neill about it because I can't,

428
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,019
I'll get this wrong, but the last two directors that are directing

429
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,039
before me were Steven Spielberg, you know.

430
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,539
You know, it was like...

431
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,500
It was like a who's who.

432
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:15,180
And I said, the first thing I said is, look, you know, you might see a few moments

433
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,700
that are below par in the next six weeks.

434
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,180
Sam was great.

435
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,660
He said, look, honestly, all sets are a bit the same.

436
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,140
And that led me to ask him, how do other people direct?

437
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:30,400
And you realise that when directors direct, they never get directed,

438
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,319
so they never see what other people are doing.

439
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,259
I'm sure AFL coaches are like that when someone comes over

440
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,380
for, or any sporting, when someone comes over for another club,

441
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,180
you want to ask them, and how does Wayne Bennett handle that situation?

442
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,039
And you realise in some leadership positions, you end up being in a silo

443
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,940
and you have the least contact with people like yourself.

444
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,099
And so I presume in that way we were trying to get an eclectic group

445
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,680
of people together that are doing things, you know, at the pointy end

446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,720
of whatever, you know, cricket or TV or, you know, AFL.

447
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,700
And just compare notes on how you handle situations,

448
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,519
often really domestic situations.

449
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,160
You know, how do you handle a really young, talented kid

450
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,460
that's not getting the best out of it?

451
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,180
How do you handle the front alphas?

452
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,000
How do you plan your day?

453
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,819
You know, how do you get rid of all the noise or a stone out of your shoe?

454
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,539
And, you know, it's funny.

455
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,500
You go into it thinking, well, I don't think I've got anything to offer.

456
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,740
And, you know, you'll say something and someone else will pop up and say,

457
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,000
I didn't realise that.

458
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:36,319
It's a trick or a hack.

459
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,099
And you go, oh, you've got to do that.

460
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,500
I've been doing that for 25 years.

461
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,779
And, you know, you can hear everyone picking up their pen and writing it down.

462
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,319
And it's funny.

463
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,420
It was a process of all of those things because in some ways, you know,

464
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,259
Marcus Bondimbelli is doing things at a higher intensity, you know,

465
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,519
a higher octane rate in some ways than all of us, you know, at a young age.

466
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,880
And so, you know, you sort of sometimes you're asking,

467
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,259
he's got more to tell.

468
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:08,099
He's got more to tell you at my age than, you know, you would imagine.

469
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,819
I love the sharing economy of us.

470
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,960
And as you said, to take the time out to reflect and be giving enough as you have,

471
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,460
Rob, with what's on your schedule.

472
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,559
And I know from what I understand, the sharing of that and the practical stuff

473
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,920
day to day that, you know, you can always add, can't you?

474
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,519
I suppose that constant never-ending self-improvement theme for people like you

475
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,759
and I suppose that group have all got that natural tendency is a good thing.

476
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:35,240
And we're looking at, Rob, as this sort of shift in leadership now.

477
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,619
A little bit from that old hierarchy to now this collaborative, self-learning,

478
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,220
self-driven environment that we're seeing is really the trademark of a lot of leaders

479
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,579
or outstanding leaders in this time.

480
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
Is that what you're witnessing, that there is a generation now that are much more

481
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,299
collaborative and self-reflective?

482
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:51,579
Yeah.

483
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,680
No, and I think that people are realising you should professionalise mentors.

484
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,220
You know, you shouldn't just trip over them and go, oh, maybe it'll happen to me.

485
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,579
Is that you've got to, in a lot of ways, you've got to make it happen.

486
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,160
I don't know about you.

487
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,339
I was from a generation where, you know, you never, it was good luck if you ran

488
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,799
into someone and you could ask them questions or you, you know,

489
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,819
wrote them a letter or something like that.

490
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,440
And now I think you can fast-track that process.

491
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,240
You know, you can really reach out.

492
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,799
It was, I think I'm right in saying that the current AFL premiership coach,

493
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,279
literally about two or three years back, got quite reflective of the situation,

494
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,900
sought out a whole bunch of people to give feedback.

495
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,039
And it's probably the missing link because when you run into, as I say,

496
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,519
when I run into another director, you know, I've got 27,000 questions to ask them.

497
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,960
It never occurred to me to professionalise it and say, well,

498
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,940
why wouldn't every person that does a lot of directing grab a couple

499
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,359
of other directors and make a regular get-together or some kind

500
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,700
of WhatsApp group, signal group?

501
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,460
One thing that came up was really interesting was I read a book

502
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,220
by a guy called Chris Hatfield who was a,

503
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,880
an astronaut, a former fighter, Canadian fighter pilot, test pilot,

504
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,980
was maybe one of the first Canadians ever to go into space,

505
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,480
went up to the space station for six months.

506
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,099
And he wrote a really interesting book because he did a clip

507
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:17,880
that became famous.

508
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,259
He did a cover of the David Bowie song and recorded it

509
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,779
on the space station because he took up a guitar.

510
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,319
And it landed on YouTube as they were in the Soyuz craft

511
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,279
coming back to Earth.

512
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,500
And so when they got, he landed in Kazakhstan, they opened the latch,

513
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,220
you know, still steaming.

514
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,119
And the Russian expert got the latch open,

515
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,500
leant in and he goes, hey, Chris, I love your video.

516
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,359
And so it had hit six million views by the time they left

517
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,900
the space station to come back out.

518
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,279
So a publisher approached him and said, I'll write a book.

519
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,799
But there's a chapter in the book and he talked about when you go

520
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,240
into a new situation as an expert, highly trained,

521
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,539
about taking a back seat.

522
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,400
And he said it even, and he talked about being a one or a zero.

523
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,980
And it was this chapter in the book.

524
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,779
He said it even mattered when he turned up to the space station.

525
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,200
And by sheer chance, I was on a conversation panel sitting next

526
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,380
to Chris Hatfield one day.

527
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,099
And after we finished, I said, listen, I've got to ask you

528
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:17,720
about the book.

529
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,059
And I want to ask you about the chapter about being a one or a zero.

530
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,920
And he stopped and he said, if no one's read the book,

531
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,359
people always ask me a question about space.

532
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,119
If they've read the book, the one thing they ask me about is

533
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,500
that chapter, about turning up to an elite situation, highly trained,

534
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,960
and not making a dick of yourself.

535
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,839
Yeah, it's a great story, Rob, isn't it?

536
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,460
That clip is so famous.

537
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,140
Can you explain a little bit more the one and the zero for those

538
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,400
that don't understand what that means?

539
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,740
There's a brilliant story around, that I've heard you tell before,

540
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:51,960
around the selection process for those elite astronauts who are obviously

541
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,720
all at a seriously high achieving level.

542
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,480
Yeah, so they're all guns.

543
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,039
They're all the best of the best.

544
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,460
But people are making judgments about you all the time.

545
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,460
And he surmised,

546
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,460
that the one thing people don't want is someone who's trying too hard

547
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,440
or a pest or trying to garner plaudits or applause or just turn up

548
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,779
and do the job you're trained for.

549
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,640
And, you know, he called it being a zero.

550
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,519
And he said the mistake everyone makes is they turn up

551
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,599
and they want to be the hero day one.

552
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,359
And he said it's not needed because the people who are running the show

553
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,440
when you turn up really want you

554
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,720
to make a contribution but not get in the way

555
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,359
because the process has already been worked out.

556
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
He explains it much better than that.

557
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,440
But I think everyone makes the mistake that you go,

558
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,539
oh, my best way of making a contribution is, you know,

559
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,500
trying so hard on my pest.

560
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,519
I might be mixing stories here, Rob,

561
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,500
but I remember talking to you about potentially there was,

562
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,960
when those guys got together, it was a cocktail function where other,

563
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,420
you know, people were trying to make a contribution.

564
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,900
Experts were looking at their behaviour and how they turned up

565
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,559
and interacted with others at literally a function

566
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,980
where they thought they weren't being assessed.

567
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:13,980
Is that part of the criteria?

568
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,380
That's right.

569
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,059
They thought they were assessed for something else,

570
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,280
but the people were just looking at them going, you know,

571
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:24,039
is he the type of astronaut that I can put up with for six months

572
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,039
in a space station?

573
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,519
Rob, you mentioned some of your hobbies and you've been described to me

574
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,820
in the past few days in research as a man of many hobbies

575
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:33,960
and you've been described to me as a man of many hobbies.

576
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,420
And you mentioned fishing and golf and you've got your pilot's licence.

577
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,360
I think you've got your helicopter licence as well and go-karting.

578
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:46,599
I never finished my helicopter licence, but that's something, you know,

579
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,239
if I didn't have five dependents, I think I'd go back to.

580
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,119
That's on the list.

581
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,820
But you tend to turn your hobbies into these extraordinary.

582
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,460
Look at fishing and then, you know, the series you created,

583
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,960
A River Somewhere, you end up fishing in the Bhutan and Wyoming,

584
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,039
Venezuela.

585
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,639
So you take something.

586
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,639
But the way your mind works, it goes to an intricate level.

587
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,260
Tell me about the fishing part because I want to talk to you about golf as well

588
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,119
and how you approach that.

589
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,739
Fishing was funny because I used to listen to Rex Hunt's fishing show

590
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:18,860
before I fished and I used to – I've always enjoyed impersonating people

591
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,719
and I used to walk around impersonating Rex Hunt and Tom Gleisner,

592
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
who was a fisherman at the time, I used to turn up and I'd go,

593
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,019
you know, folks, I was up on the banks of the Acheron and I cut my teeth

594
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,880
and so I became.

595
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,780
I'm knowledgeable about fishing, having never fished because three years

596
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,480
of listening to the Rex Hunt fishing show.

597
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,599
And one day Tom Gleisner said, look, how about, do you want to go fishing?

598
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,960
And I go, oh, yeah, that'd be great.

599
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,739
And so one Sunday we headed up to a lake near Daylesford in Victoria

600
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:56,000
and it was just the most magnificent day and we were casting our little lures,

601
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,679
got a couple of redfin trout, you know, taking our lunch in there,

602
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,260
the birds were chirping and all this.

603
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,820
And I go – and I just – as we were driving out, the sun was setting

604
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,880
and I just thought it couldn't be more perfect.

605
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,219
The filtered light came through and landed on a sign saying,

606
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,019
fishing prohibited.

607
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,820
So he'd taken me to a place where fishing was prohibited.

608
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:27,820
Your approach to golf is a fascinating insight for me as well.

609
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,780
So it's unravelled many a person, the game of golf, me included.

610
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:33,219
But –

611
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:33,239
Yeah.

612
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,619
And you've played for a long time.

613
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,619
But tell me the story.

614
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,619
You went to the elite golf program at Victoria University and said,

615
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,739
take me on.

616
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,820
What age were you?

617
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,500
Oh, we were mid-30s, late-30s.

618
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,239
So we were surrounded – what happened was a friend made the point,

619
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,420
they said, why would you only have elite training methods for elite players?

620
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
They're probably more useful for hacks like us.

621
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,480
And so we were all, you know, as I said, we were 24,

622
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
which isn't –

623
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,159
so much a handicap as a participation ribbon.

624
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,500
And I've always loved science and he had a contact

625
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,820
at the Victorian Institute of Sport, a guy – we were quite innovative.

626
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,320
A guy called Vern became quite famous for developing these programs.

627
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,019
You know, golf was the one that, you know,

628
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,280
people were walking around with a beer belly and he sort of –

629
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,440
he was one of the people that ushered in what was called the flat tummy golfers,

630
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,900
you know, the Tiger Woods and all that.

631
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:38,119
And we thought, well, if we're going to do exercises and drills and sort of things,

632
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:39,280
why would we do the dumb ones?

633
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,679
Why wouldn't we do the smart ones?

634
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,440
So we went down to the VAS and he was kind enough to speak to us

635
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
and we put that to him.

636
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,260
We said, why don't you let some hack golfers do your program?

637
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,480
And he said, oh, gee, that sounds interesting.

638
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,739
And so we set about, you know, doing all these – you know, now it's commonplace,

639
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,360
but back then it was groundbreaking.

640
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,639
And it was very little weights.

641
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,619
And it was all body weight and resistance bands.

642
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,539
And it was really – it was interesting as well as being fun.

643
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:12,000
And so we worked at it.

644
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,880
And, you know, I'm sure – someone said to me at the end of it, you know,

645
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:19,460
my aim was to get down to single figures, which I did.

646
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,039
And I said, what was the real secret?

647
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,079
And I said, it's probably playing twice a week.

648
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,340
After all that.

649
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,579
Yeah, extraordinary, isn't it, to see.

650
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:29,659
Yeah.

651
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah.

652
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:29,960
Yeah.

653
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,019
Yeah.

654
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:30,059
Yeah.

655
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:30,340
Yeah.

656
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,360
Yeah.

657
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,380
Yeah.

658
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,420
Yeah.

659
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,440
Yeah.

660
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,460
Yeah.

661
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:30,579
Yeah.

662
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:30,659
Yeah.

663
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:30,699
Yeah.

664
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:30,860
Yeah.

665
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,920
Yeah.

666
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:30,940
Yeah.

667
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

668
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,019
Yeah.

669
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:31,059
Yeah.

670
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:31,099
Yeah.

671
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:31,139
Yeah.

672
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:31,619
Yeah.

673
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:31,739
Yeah.

674
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:31,780
Yeah.

675
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:31,800
Yeah.

676
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:31,820
Yeah.

677
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:31,840
Yeah.

678
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:31,860
Yeah.

679
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,880
Yeah.

680
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah.

681
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,099
Yeah.

682
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,179
Yeah.

683
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:32,239
Yeah.

684
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:32,260
Yeah.

685
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,360
Yeah.

686
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,380
Yeah.

687
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,500
Yeah.

688
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,559
Yeah.

689
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:32,599
Yeah.

690
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:32,619
Yeah.

691
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:32,639
Yeah.

692
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:32,659
Yeah.

693
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:32,699
Yeah.

694
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:32,719
Yeah.

695
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,119
Yeah.

696
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,199
Yeah.

697
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,579
There in your life and you can see there's a systematic and thought out and getting a

698
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,139
shortcut going to who's the best in your area.

699
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,719
Is there other habits and things that you do daily, Rob, that set you up for success?

700
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,340
Funny enough, I make no mistake.

701
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,019
I reckon I'm as haphazard as everybody.

702
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:59,320
The biggest thing I find is it's – you've got to let the habit do the work for you in

703
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,079
just about anything.

704
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,980
that's you know if you leave it to your to your vibe on the day it's it's not that's what i said

705
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,940
about one of the best things we ever did in at working dogs we got an office and we got an office

706
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:17,420
sorted out properly and sort of there was no formality to turning up but you know informally

707
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,900
we ended up everyone you know gee well if you're going to turn up every day at 8 30 i better i

708
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,199
guess i better that and then and that's a i think that's a really good habit i can't remember

709
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:33,599
the sort of science on this seems to vary but you know 30 days 50 days creates a habit

710
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,599
and after that i think it the effort of something gets hard because the habit does the work for you

711
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:53,800
now rob we've been talking to a range of of leaders in this space and and finding that there

712
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,980
are a handful of dimensions or characters of leaders in this 21st century style which you

713
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,480
sum up perfectly the way you approach life and the way you

714
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,000
approach life and the way you approach life and the way you approach life and the way you

715
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,519
approach your directing and everything in your life and answer these as expansively or as short

716
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,400
as you like, but you might be over it by now, but-

717
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,480
Fruits, fruit, kiwi fruit, kiwi fruit.

718
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,199
That's it. That's over. You've got it in one. We've been talking about self-leadership first

719
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,420
for people as probably the dimension to start with. What do you think of when I

720
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,800
ask you about self-leadership? I struggle a little bit with discipline.

721
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:39,659
I go, in some ways, I envy having the people that have an elite sporting ability at a young age.

722
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:46,280
I reckon if you had to pick the best training ground, I think sport does it. I think it's fun.

723
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:53,400
It's physical and fun. My thing was the best thing that ever happened to me, I think there's

724
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,099
always a, I keep saying, there's always a bit of luck in how things turn out. My luck was finding

725
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,760
that the creative,

726
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:09,559
arts were team-based and I went, oh, this is, I'm not in the under 14 Bs. It's the same fun,

727
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,179
but it's actually, you can do it at a higher level. And the team aspect was the thing that

728
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:17,559
really captured you, Rob, the fact that you could creatively work together?

729
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,599
Yeah. Some people wake up one day and I want to be a solo artist. I wanted to be in a band.

730
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,780
And clearly you have a positive impact, having been around you enough,

731
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,840
on your environment. How do you think about positively impacting other people in your

732
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:42,840
environment? This is a good subject because I declared before we talk about, I don't know

733
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:51,619
the answer to this. I reckon advice is a really, really hard thing to give. And so I sort of skirt

734
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:59,840
advice now because it's sometimes, it's like you're speaking at a frequency no one's hearing.

735
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,239
But one of the things that I think is helpful is you talk about mistakes.

736
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:13,019
And I reckon you're, that's a way, it gives the person the opportunity to turn it over in their

737
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,460
own heads and work out what's to learn from it. I think coming through the front door and goes,

738
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,460
here's what you should do, I think is, has got a very low success rate.

739
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,840
Yeah, that's interesting. So you're, the actual straight up, a bit of advice just doesn't land,

740
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,519
but you're talking about being open to your own mistakes and saying, hey, this is something that

741
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,780
has gone wrong with me.

742
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,159
Yeah.

743
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,480
Yeah. Yeah. Save yourself the heartache. Don't do this.

744
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:35,780
Yeah.

745
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:41,639
Or don't do this is no good. But it's saying, you know, just in case this overlaps with you,

746
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,239
here's a big mistake I make, or here's something that I, if I had my time over again, I probably

747
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,440
could have, there's a better shortcut than that one. And I think talking like that

748
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:01,179
resonates with people a bit more than, and I sometimes think even people that ask for advice,

749
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:01,780
it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a,

750
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,539
it's, you can't give them advice. You've got to couch it in terms of, look, this may not apply to

751
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:12,639
you. Here's a, there's a bit of a split in the paths here. You know, I took this path and it

752
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,380
didn't work out. You know, if in doubt, take, go the other way.

753
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,019
And historically, that's something that never happened, is it? We never, people, you know,

754
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:24,579
admitting you had a fault or a mistake or wasn't really an option for people in leadership roles.

755
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,460
If you've got an example, Rob, is there, I mean, you look at your career and everything looks as

756
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,760
though it just turns out to go.

757
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,659
Is there a mistake that you could share with us that comes to mind that maybe humanizes you

758
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:44,460
slightly? It's funny. It's funny. When, when we get together, the things, the things you exchange

759
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:51,820
are not, are not the success stories, are they? Like funny stories, success stories aren't the

760
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:59,940
funny stories. It's true. It's, it's, it's sort of, it's kind of like, I can't, I can't think of,

761
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,739
you know, moments when,

762
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,699
you know, you're an absolute idiot.

763
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:15,980
But, but like, it's, it is funny. It's not so much a work thing, but I, all of us at Working Dog

764
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:23,559
and, and all of my wider comedy friends, our currency is, is stories where, funny stories

765
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:28,900
at the expense of yourself. Yeah. They just seem to be funny. It's like, like it's one,

766
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,739
I had the privilege of, of going to,

767
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:39,659
to launch the dish in South Africa. We were, quite a lot of countries picked it up and we had a

768
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:52,239
relationship with a distributor and we went over, this one hurts. We, we went over, over there and

769
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:57,579
they said, we landed in Cape Town and they're really hosting just wonderfully. And they said,

770
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:00,800
oh, did you want to go out to Robben Island?

771
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,260
And I said, you know, which was the prison where Nelson Mandela was held. And, and I,

772
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:12,960
and I wasn't hearing the full thing. And he said, oh, you can, we leave early at seven and I'm going,

773
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,519
God, I'm so jet-lagged. And then we've got to get up really early. And so I sort of didn't fully

774
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,219
hear it, but we can get in there before the tourism, because we can get a tour with, and I,

775
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:29,559
and I didn't quite hear what was said. And so anyway, we, we arrived at the boat, took out the,

776
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,739
the sort of the wardens that looked after the place

777
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:36,639
and there was this quite a diminutive sort of fellow

778
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,800
of Indian descent who was waiting for us and I wasn't properly

779
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,179
introduced to him and he was talking to one of the people

780
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,679
on the boat and anyway, we started, he started walking us

781
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:52,380
around Robben Island and he seemed to know a hell of a lot

782
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,800
about Robben Island and I'm going and I knew a fair bit

783
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,719
about the story and I think I said something like at one point,

784
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,539
you seem to know a lot about Robben Island.

785
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,519
Where did that come from?

786
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,539
It probably wasn't as bad as that.

787
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,940
Don't tell me it was Nelson.

788
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,699
No, he said, well, I was imprisoned here for 27 years with Nelson.

789
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,719
Oh, wow.

790
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,780
And I've gone and then the pennies dropped.

791
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:20,599
It was Amit Kothrada who was, there was five, six and as the words,

792
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,139
I don't know that I said it as badly as that but he was as generous

793
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:27,780
as that back to and he just smiled and he said, well,

794
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,820
you know, being in prison with Nelson for 18 or something years was

795
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,860
and as I'm looking at him, he's looking at me, he's going,

796
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,559
you've got to take a few deep breaths now, my friend.

797
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,579
I love that overlap and that to me is the overlap of sport, isn't it?

798
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,179
A currency is exactly the same thing.

799
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,460
You don't talk about your success, you talk about the many moments

800
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,280
like that.

801
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,159
That stays with you for a while, that one.

802
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,780
Yeah, that stayed with me for a while.

803
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,119
It's incredible.

804
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,900
One of the dimensions we talk about, Rob, is the ability to have a vision

805
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,260
and create and share it.

806
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,099
How do you think about that in the context of what you do,

807
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:08,199
creating and sharing a vision?

808
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,340
One thing I think with us is you've got to have an idea you love

809
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,059
and that gives the momentum and then it's the goal.

810
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,800
But we don't put all the chips in one basket.

811
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,079
We test and we do pilots and our industry has sort of in some ways

812
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,780
lost the art of that.

813
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,900
You know, in the old days,

814
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,179
there was a lot of development before you went to air and now things

815
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,320
have almost got to be ready.

816
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,400
So we take a lot of that offline and try and enjoy that process

817
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,840
because, you know, you've got to get rid of the easy mistakes

818
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,360
before the public see it.

819
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,079
Yeah, the goal, I think a big goal helps.

820
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,699
I reckon a big goal is I think that that's the shorthand way

821
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:53,980
of communicating with everyone.

822
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,800
And prepared if you've got something, get it out there.

823
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,440
Get it out there, test it.

824
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:57,880
Yeah.

825
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,739
Is it the gap between you having an idea and testing it?

826
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,679
Is that pretty sure?

827
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,780
Do you tend to put them out there?

828
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,960
Yeah, we tend to test a lot because, I mean,

829
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,920
the whole digital industry can do that so easily these days.

830
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,579
So in all that beta testing they do, it's a test.

831
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,000
A lot of the great inventions of the world were really just tinkerers

832
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,960
doing test, test, test, you know.

833
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,840
It's sort of when you read the Dyson vacuum cleaner,

834
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,739
you read his story.

835
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,760
He was, you know, it wasn't quantum physics.

836
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:36,159
1,287 iterations, I think, or thereabouts in his shed at the back

837
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,380
having nearly sold the farm.

838
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
It's a great story, isn't it?

839
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,519
Really running out of money, you know, and just one after another iteration

840
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,019
to get that right.

841
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:46,579
Well, actually, if he's still listening, Luke,

842
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:47,880
could he come up with a better battery?

843
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,619
We'll get on to Sir James and give him that feedback.

844
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,280
I've heard you talk a lot about curiosity,

845
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,940
and we see that as being a really shared trait of leaders like yourself.

846
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,099
And then people with curiosity and how they approach their own learning

847
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,360
and development, does that resonate with you?

848
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,900
What are your thoughts on curiosity?

849
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,940
So that comes, you know, some things come easily to you,

850
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,860
and that does for me.

851
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,000
I've always been really curious as a person,

852
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:20,519
and so I sort of think that's effortless for me.

853
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,480
It's funny, if you can tell someone to be curious,

854
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,539
I think you either.

855
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,260
You either are.

856
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,500
I reckon one of the most underestimated factors is enthusiasm.

857
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,159
I think a lot of people think it's cool to be, you know,

858
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,460
a bit of a flat affect and a bit, you know, a bit emotionless.

859
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:45,199
And I don't reckon, I reckon that undersells the influence

860
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,480
enthusiasm can have.

861
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,780
In fact, I think, you know, just about every subject on leadership,

862
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,219
there's a Winston Churchill quote, but I think this is Winston Churchill

863
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:53,659
who said,

864
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:57,000
success is maintaining enthusiasm through repeated failure.

865
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,179
And there's a lot, I reckon there's a lot in that.

866
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,900
I reckon enthusiasm gets you up.

867
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:06,460
Talk about communication a lot, Rob, and speaking in the recent days

868
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,139
to a couple of your close friends, and they've talked about your ability

869
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,820
to communicate as being extraordinary and in the director's chair

870
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,960
or wherever you are to just have a way of being able just to hit

871
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,420
the right note at the right time with the right person.

872
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,159
Is that something that, again,

873
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,980
has that come easy to you or the way you communicate with clarity,

874
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,059
is that something you've had to work on?

875
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,559
I reckon you get, if you haven't thought it through enough,

876
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:32,559
you get a bit wordy.

877
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,739
You just crap on a bit.

878
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,039
You circle around the point just looking for a place to land.

879
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:46,599
But sometimes, you know, you, I think that's why a lot of people,

880
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,480
you know, say, oh, they have sleepless nights.

881
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,880
What they're trying to do is think of a really simple way to explain their

882
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,179
point, and that's worth a lot, I reckon.

883
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,900
I reckon, you know, it's, I don't think you want to be giving

884
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,880
10-page papers on what you're trying to solve.

885
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,239
I reckon a couple of simple sentences is the big key, you know,

886
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,000
and I reckon when you're running a shoot, you have to set the tone.

887
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:16,579
Sometimes the tone goes off a bit, and you just want to,

888
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,780
before a read-through, I'll think about it all night.

889
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,179
I'll go.

890
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,980
Literally give myself a word limit, you know, two sentences and a let's get

891
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:34,800
started, and, you know, sometimes, so it's not banging on about how we all

892
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,239
need to just concentrate a bit more.

893
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,940
It might be something for I reckon we're turning up a little underprepared

894
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,139
after lunch or, but I reckon one or two sentences, if you keep it short,

895
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:47,820
it has a good effect.

896
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,760
If you bang on, I reckon you're diluted.

897
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,980
Yeah, word economy.

898
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:52,760
That's interesting.

899
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,639
That is interesting.

900
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,980
But make no mistake, Luke, I can crap on with the best.

901
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:00,280
I'm talking about my best moments.

902
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:04,159
I was self-reflecting as you were saying that as well, Rob,

903
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,519
and I probably held you here a bit longer than I probably promised you as well.

904
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,400
Collaboration is another final dimension that we're talking about a lot

905
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,420
and that all the great leaders that we're seeing coming through are collaborators,

906
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:19,559
and you've identified that at a young age that you said you weren't a solo artist,

907
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,119
you wanted to be in the band.

908
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,719
How important is that collaboration?

909
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,880
How important has collaboration been to you?

910
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:29,059
I think that's possibly the area where you do need to know yourself or, you know,

911
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,699
what's that old saying is when someone tells you who they are, believe them.

912
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,880
Well, when your instinct tells you who you are, don't put your square peg in a round hole.

913
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,119
You know, if you really are that solo person, then be the solo person.

914
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:49,500
And if you're not, you know, it does go back to that.

915
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,440
It takes a bit of flying hours to be a good collaborator.

916
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,579
But, you know, patience is always in short supply,

917
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,760
especially when you get a whole bunch of driven people together, you know.

918
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:06,360
So I think we all, a bit of manners, a bit of patience, you know,

919
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,199
but I don't think it's a sin to be driven.

920
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,239
A couple of final questions, Rob, that I've been asking across the board,

921
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,519
and I'll start with this one.

922
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:18,480
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

923
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:21,619
That's really, really interesting.

924
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:22,360
Because I saw...

925
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:32,360
There were moments when people had a huge effect in a short period of time.

926
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,039
And I was saying that the Dean of Medicine at Royal Melbourne Hospital was,

927
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,199
you know, you don't get there by chance.

928
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,719
And all I remember was I was fully expecting to be, you know,

929
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:52,079
the severe guy out of the Paper Chase movie, you know, the Harvard professor.

930
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,280
Who doesn't take prisoners.

931
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,820
And I'm sure he was all of that.

932
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:02,739
But sort of just that moment of kindness and understanding and mischief.

933
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:06,019
He goes, geez, take a year off and tour a show.

934
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:06,760
That sounds good.

935
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,559
Like that happened so quickly.

936
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:13,639
And he said something to me once, and I went,

937
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,400
I've never forgotten and tend to repeat it a lot.

938
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,239
When you think about all the things that people aim at,

939
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,719
he just sort of...

940
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,820
He dropped his voice once to me and he said, you know what, Rob,

941
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,300
at the end of the day, what we really, really value is the respect of our peers.

942
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,380
And he went, God, that's a really powerful...

943
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,780
Like you see that in footballers.

944
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:44,139
You see it in every form of life that don't underestimate how important

945
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:47,800
that incentive is to garner the respect of your peers.

946
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:51,659
Amazing how much impact one moment can have, isn't it, as you said,

947
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:52,619
potentially a pathway.

948
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,619
And life changes on that one conversation.

949
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,039
It's an amazing story going all the way back to your life in medical school.

950
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,980
Final question, Rob, and I'm supremely appreciative of your time

951
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,860
and I've always enjoyed any moment to catch up with you.

952
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,500
But in the spirit of collaboration, I wanted to ask you if there was one person

953
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,519
anywhere in the world at any time that you could collaborate with,

954
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:16,179
is there a name that comes to mind?

955
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:19,019
Jeez, that's really...

956
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:19,980
There tend to be.

957
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,340
There tend to be someone.

958
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,840
And funnily enough, you go, as an actor, if you had the right thing,

959
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:30,119
it'd be someone like, I know this sounds funny, someone like Will Ferrell.

960
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:32,320
You go, because I've met Will.

961
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,300
And the minute we sort of thought the complete opposite of what you thought,

962
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,619
Hollywood star, we were going to ask him to do something

963
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,099
and he just stopped and went, what's that?

964
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,920
How do we do that?

965
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,659
And he went, oh, God, what a dream.

966
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,500
As crazy and silly as he is, he's a really smart guy

967
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,380
and he really loves the outcome.

968
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:58,860
Like in a, I think it is in a silly sense, or someone, I don't know,

969
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,880
I said this the other day, is I'm not sure whether I actually do shows

970
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,239
because I want the end product or that I want the social life

971
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,900
that's attached to doing shows.

972
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:15,320
I've realised at this point I really enjoy the social life

973
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,719
that's attached with a project.

974
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:21,139
And so someone like Jon Stewart,

975
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:24,719
who did The Daily Show for many, many years,

976
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:31,840
I reckon guys like that are really good at setting up a good social life

977
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,360
attached to the project.

978
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,019
So just understanding that, Rob, the enjoyment for you is, you know,

979
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,659
not so much the end outcome of whatever success looks like,

980
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:43,500
but the collaboration and the team and the enjoyment along the way.

981
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:44,619
Is that the thing?

982
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:44,840
Yeah.

983
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,460
Yeah, yeah.

984
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:46,460
I don't know.

985
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:52,019
I don't, everyone, I've met a lot of people often,

986
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:52,699
often,

987
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,900
you know, American friends who, they do projects and they get to the end of it

988
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,940
and there was no fun involved.

989
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:01,880
And I reckon I've reached a stage where I'm not up for that anymore.

990
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:04,900
You know, Gia was a terrible shoot, but the film was great.

991
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,480
I don't, I don't, I don't have that in me.

992
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,400
Aligned with you very much on that, Rob.

993
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,320
The joy of the teams that you're in is really, for me,

994
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,119
the same essence of where the fun is, whatever you do.

995
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:17,139
Well, it's funny.

996
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:19,519
I love hearing sporting teams say, in actual fact,

997
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,699
it often goes hand in hand.

998
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:25,460
And often when you look at those Netflix docos and all that sort of stuff,

999
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,079
you, you, the best teams often got, got on pretty well.

1000
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:30,559
Agree.

1001
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:32,159
And, and you realise, you know,

1002
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,340
lucky enough to play sport for a living for, for over a decade.

1003
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,579
And, and, and when you do that,

1004
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,860
that amount of time and you literally shower together three times a day,

1005
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,920
there's not much left in terms of if you don't get on and they end up being

1006
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,599
these great lifelong friendships, which is the real joy.

1007
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,320
We spoke about the, would you be jealous because you didn't win the ultimate

1008
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,780
prize and that was definitely there for a while.

1009
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,280
But what you realise is that you get these great friendships for life out of

1010
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,340
shared passion and I'm very fortunate to have been part of that.

1011
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,579
There's something interesting about the ultimate, ultimate prize.

1012
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:08,840
There's a, there's a psychiatrist or a psychologist in Los Angeles who's

1013
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,219
become famous for giving therapy to, you know, elite actors.

1014
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:21,019
And he, he talks about something like Oscar syndrome and that is,

1015
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,420
he sometimes have to prepare actors that are red hot favourite to win for the

1016
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,619
aftermath because in their mind,

1017
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:31,679
they've been so focused on that being the purpose of their life.

1018
00:58:32,019 --> 00:58:36,840
And he has to explain to them that there's going to be this slow shock that

1019
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,760
sets in after you win, that everyone's life goes back to normal.

1020
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,079
And 99.9% of people don't care.

1021
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,860
And he said, it's a real syndrome.

1022
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,599
And I sort of think if you broaden that out, if you take him at his word,

1023
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:53,239
it sounds like, you know, he's been doing it for 20 years.

1024
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,159
It sounds like it's true.

1025
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,300
Sometimes you're so goal orientated, you make the mistake of thinking,

1026
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,880
achieving the goal solves everything.

1027
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,420
And I think we all suspect that's not how it works.

1028
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:04,679
It's a great point you make.

1029
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:08,239
And I can relate to when you, having finished working in the media immediately

1030
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,920
after playing footy, you finish your career, everyone wants to win the

1031
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,980
premiership and you don't.

1032
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:16,639
And there's that pang of regret about not achieving what you essentially set

1033
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:17,340
out to do.

1034
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,360
And then I had the, for the first seven years after I played,

1035
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,260
it'd be in the winning rooms grand final day every year and interviewing

1036
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,539
often players that end up being old teammates of mine that had gone on to,

1037
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:29,559
and it could cross down to you in the rooms.

1038
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,099
Here's Brian Lake, you've won your third premiership.

1039
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:34,980
And part of you is trying to say, for God's sake, man,

1040
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,619
if you had to try that hard when we were playing,

1041
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:37,780
I might've been able to achieve it with you.

1042
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,280
And then speaking to mates who did go on to win one and their reflection,

1043
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,780
Rob, you know, over a beer would be, do you know what?

1044
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,139
It wasn't as good as you thought it was going to be.

1045
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:49,980
It was, it was great,

1046
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,000
but it didn't change your life shortly afterwards you were back.

1047
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,079
And I'm not sure if that was more frustrating or, you know,

1048
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,920
it definitely took me seven years to get over it,

1049
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,380
but I can relate to that for sure.

1050
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:02,360
And it's amazing how soon after you have to put the bins out,

1051
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,699
just like you did before.

1052
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:07,460
Rob, I love catching up with you.

1053
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,460
I'm always inspired and enlightened by any conversation with you and really

1054
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,760
appreciate your time and lots of fascinating thoughts as always,

1055
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,619
and really appreciate everything that you do.

1056
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:18,820
And,

1057
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,119
and it's great to catch up with you again today.

1058
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,360
I love chatting Luke off and on air.

1059
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,860
Thank you.

1060
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,340
Thanks Rob.

1061
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,099
