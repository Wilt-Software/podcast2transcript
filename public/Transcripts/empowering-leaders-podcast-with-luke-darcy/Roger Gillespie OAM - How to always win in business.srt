00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,310
Our next guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,369
is Roger Gillespie, the founder of Baker's Delight.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,630
I love catching up with him in person

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,510
and the strong sense of values comes through,

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,730
his passion for ethical leadership

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,850
and the idea that everyone in business should win,

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,010
your suppliers, your customers, your partners.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,809
It's an incredible legacy that he has.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,250
Everyone wins.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,530
You stay in business longer.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,689
If there's a lopsided relationship, it doesn't work.

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,130
Look, if you don't treat your wife well,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,189
she won't stay around.

14
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,590
It's the same thing.

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,649
You've got to have a win-win.

16
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:55,920
Very closely aligned with the work that we're doing at Alita,

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,759
where leaders are getting together to connect,

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,759
to learn and to share

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,679
and what we think is a life-changing opportunity.

20
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,459
I hope you enjoy this chat with Roger Gillespie,

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,040
the founder of Baker's Delight, as much as I did.

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,120
Roger Gillespie is a fourth-generation baker.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,040
In 19...

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,579
In 1980, he and his wife, Lesley,

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,900
opened the first Baker's Delight in Melbourne's Glenferry Road, Hawthorne,

26
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,659
with the aim of making enough money

27
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,400
to be able to choose the schools they wanted their kids to attend.

28
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,340
40 years later, Baker's Delight has over 700 stores

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,719
across Australia, New Zealand and North America,

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,159
becoming one of Australia's greatest-ever business success stories.

31
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,159
Roger and his family are celebrated

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,299
for their outstanding contribution and philanthropy,

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,719
including the Prime Minister's Award for Excellence

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,019
in Community Business Partnership

35
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,700
for their work with the Breast Cancer Network Australia.

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,959
They've raised over $20 million in the past 20 years.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,459
Roger, it's great to catch up with you in person.

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,540
I really appreciate your time today.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,659
Well, it's a pleasure to be here, Luke,

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,980
and thanks for the invitation.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,700
Can I go back to 1980 to start with...

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,120
You opened that first store in Glenferry Road, Hawthorne.

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,340
Could you believe 40 years later

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,900
that you'd employ more than 15,000 people in a 700-store?

45
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,459
I mean, was it even possible in your mind?

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,699
It was possible, but it wasn't a dream at that point.

47
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,080
People often say, well, where did you get the idea?

48
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,780
Well, the idea just evolved.

49
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,740
We had one store,

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,039
and then there was another opportunity for another one,

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
so we took it, another one, another one,

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,000
and then a whole lot more people wanted to be part of it,

53
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
so we just kept going.

54
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,599
And I'm an addict, I should mention.

55
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,020
I'll fess up straight away.

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,159
I'm addicted to opening bakeries.

57
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,400
If I don't open one for a month, I get the shakes,

58
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,919
and I have to keep at it.

59
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,500
Well, does that come from your dad?

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,879
I'll jump into there, because there's a famous line,

61
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,699
I think he said to you, you know, as a baker himself,

62
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,159
people always want to eat bread.

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,879
It was...

64
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,439
Pretty reasonable thought, isn't it?

65
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:44,979
Yeah, yeah.

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,099
Well, and that's been true so far,

67
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,500
and it's looking good for the future.

68
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,900
You started with a business partner,

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,139
a guy by the name of Gary Stevenson,

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,620
and a handful of years in, you're buying him out.

71
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,939
Can I ask you about that?

72
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,439
Was that a difficult thing to do?

73
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,039
And I suppose if you're Gary, does he look back and think,

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
gee, I might have been well advised to hang around

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,379
with Roger and Leslie?

76
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,039
Yeah, well, sadly, we've lost contact with him,

77
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,219
and I'd like to be able to catch up with him.

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
I haven't seen him for, I'd say, 15 years.

79
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,039
I think we had a celebration.

80
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,580
We hit 25 years, and he came along to that.

81
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:21,939
But he wanted to follow his dream and be in the IT world,

82
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,199
so he'd had enough of bakeries, so he said,

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,699
I want to get out, so we bought him out.

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,919
There are lots of bakeries around the world, Roger.

85
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,400
Why has Baker's Delight, in your mind, been such a success?

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,099
Well, I think it comes from our actual name,

87
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,099
which ironically we don't have the same name in Canada,

88
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,099
but we...

89
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,479
are equally successful.

90
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,419
But we live to delight.

91
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,379
You know, when we thought of the name, we said, well, we're bakers,

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,639
and we want to delight every customer,

93
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,620
and we want to be delighted as bakers

94
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,360
when we pull a loaf of bread out of the oven.

95
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,360
We want that delight to be felt in our own staff

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,979
and then pass that delight on to every customer.

97
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,099
And we still are true to that, to the name,

98
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,180
and to ignite that passion for anyone who wants to join us.

99
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,400
So when I used to recruit franchisees,

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,240
I'd say,

101
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,139
you have to be so enthusiastic about, you know,

102
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,980
delighting every customer that you've got to walk through a brick wall

103
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,240
and then crawl across broken glass if you want to be part of this business.

104
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,839
That's how enthusiastic you have to be.

105
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,699
And that's sort of instilled.

106
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,279
It's part of our culture that you've got to be committed

107
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,579
to delighting every customer every day.

108
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,980
And it is the values that when you read about your history

109
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,000
that you live and, you know, you train people and crew.

110
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,720
And you're a great part of the communities that you live in.

111
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,160
And all the stores are really attached to their...

112
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Can you kind of pick on what you said before?

113
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:45,300
Because it's interesting.

114
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,100
You think of this great brand now, Baker's Delight,

115
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,699
and it's a brilliant name, and you live it with your values.

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,980
But in Canada, where you're growing, you know, exponentially,

117
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,180
it's Cobb's?

118
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,240
It's Cobb's Bread, yeah.

119
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,519
So why the change in that part of the world?

120
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,839
Well, we tried to use Baker's Delight there.

121
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,199
We got the lawyers to do a company search,

122
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,160
and there was a company there called Bakery Delight,

123
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,439
spelled slightly differently.

124
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,819
And they sold muffin mix.

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,120
And in Australia, we'd be able to sort of cohabitate using the brands,

126
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,579
for different businesses, but we couldn't do it.

127
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,259
So we asked them for permission and offered them some money.

128
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,160
And they quickly turned to their lawyers

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
and asked for 10 times more than what we'd offered them.

130
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,639
And our offer was 100 grand, and they wanted a million.

131
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,800
We didn't know whether we were going to succeed or not.

132
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,920
So we said, well, we're opening them as company-owned bakeries,

133
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,339
so they're company-owned bakeries, Cobb's.

134
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,379
And then we discovered later that it also stands for Canada's Own Bread

135
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,620
and a few other acronyms,

136
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Cunning Old Baker.

137
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,720
And the same sort of design.

138
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,819
People go into our Canadian stores and discuss it.

139
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,500
This is a rip-off from Baker's Delight.

140
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,459
And similarly, Canadians come to our store here and say,

141
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,860
this is a rip-off of Cobb's Bread.

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,279
So we talk about you and your values, which you're renowned for,

143
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,600
and I read about you really obsessed with win-wins for your franchises.

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,079
Is their success paramount to you?

145
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,139
Yeah.

146
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,079
Your ongoing success, and you talk about the loyalty to your suppliers.

147
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,399
Some of them have been with you for decades and decades,

148
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,560
and it's customer first.

149
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,220
I love that message, Roger.

150
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,399
In a world now where I feel like everyone in business is trying to get a win

151
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,759
over someone else, or there's got to be a winner and a loser,

152
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,259
can you explain why that's worked so well for you?

153
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,759
It was – I don't know when we first sort of realised that that's the way we work,

154
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,879
but it's every relationship we have has to be a win-win.

155
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,079
So whether it's a customer,

156
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,500
whether it's a customer coming and getting love for bread,

157
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,660
the customer has to be happy to pay whatever they pay

158
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,519
to receive the product they love and enjoy.

159
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,779
We have to be happy to pay for the price of flour.

160
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,360
We have to be happy to pay certain rents.

161
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,560
Sadly, that doesn't happen as often as it should, but it's getting better.

162
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,259
So it's just everyone wins.

163
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
You stay in business longer.

164
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,759
If there's a lopsided relationship, it doesn't work.

165
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,720
If you don't treat your wife well, she won't stay around.

166
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,240
It's the same thing.

167
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,060
you know, you've got to have a win-win. Everyone has to be happy, both sides of the equation. If

168
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,720
you're not, it doesn't last. Simple as that. Well, it sounds like old-fashioned values,

169
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,120
Roger, but when you think about it, it is good business, isn't it? And it's sustainable,

170
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,300
and it's happier business, isn't it? And I mean, you know, you get a win over someone and they

171
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,060
lose. I mean, I am a bit of a believer in the karmic cycle comes around eventually, isn't it?

172
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,259
So having said that, I mean, it's not utopia, is it? I mean, you have people that don't work out,

173
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,920
but franchisees that aren't up to it. And so I read some of your language there, and correct me

174
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,620
if I'm wrong, hire slowly, fire quickly. So explain a bit more about why that's important to you.

175
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:55,199
Well, if you've got an infection in your body, if you don't deal with it, you'll get sicker.

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,279
So it's the same, you know, the old saying of a rotten apple in a case causes all the apples to

177
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,399
go off. So you've really got to weed the garden regularly and get rid of the components that

178
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,240
aren't working. If you don't do that, the...

179
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,939
The negative drags down the positive and the whole thing goes pretty ugly. And we don't want that.

180
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,180
So your instinct is when you get an instinct that someone's just not up to it,

181
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,300
you really should act quickly.

182
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah. Yeah. Have to. Yeah. And sadly, we don't always, but wherever we can, we do.

183
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:31,660
I love self-made stories. And it's so brilliant to sit along across from you now to tell...

184
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,139
To someone listening to this who wants to start, wants to have a go, has got an idea,

185
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,200
what do you say to an aspiring entrepreneur?

186
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,899
Be clear on what you're trying to achieve, get good people to help you, get good legal advice,

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,100
but be committed, 100% committed, you know, walking through the brick wall and

188
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,059
crawl across broken glass. It will be harder than you think, it will take longer than you think,

189
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,539
and it will cost more than you think. So if you go in with your eyes open,

190
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,899
realizing those three things, you're more likely to succeed. But if you're half-hearted,

191
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,580
it won't work. You've got to be 100% committed,

192
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,419
and really get other people supporting you, and get other people on board to

193
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,940
celebrate your idea and make it happen with you.

194
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
But genuinely have a go. I can see that in you.

195
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,700
Exactly. If you don't have a go, you know, like your early career as a football player,

196
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,960
18 men line up on each side, same weight, same, you know, but the ones who are more determined,

197
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,879
more skilled, follow the coach, do the job properly, they come out the winner. Simple.

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,679
That's how life works in almost every situation. Baker's Delight, Roger, is a genuine family

199
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,019
business.

200
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,279
It is you and Leslie who founded it, and now the succession planning, your daughter,

201
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,779
Elise, her husband, David, are joint CEOs in this part of the world, and your son, Aaron,

202
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,740
heads up the North American business. We all know families have ups and downs, businesses have ups

203
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,559
and downs. How have you treaded that path so successfully to be able to manage, you know,

204
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,539
family and siblings and kids working together, and you working with Leslie so effectively?

205
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:09,059
Well, we started with the next generation 15 years ago. We had a fellow called Michael Andrew,

206
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,720
who sadly passed away three years ago. He chaired our family council, which we set up about 15 years

207
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,860
ago, and the kids weren't really interested at that point. All of them were working in Canada

208
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,860
and living in Canada. Our daughter and her husband lived there for eight years, and they were working

209
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,600
together, and they were working well, but Elise wanted to come back to Australia, and her husband's

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,659
South African. He didn't care where he lived as long as he was with her. It's their 12th wedding

211
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:38,840
anniversary today, by the way.

212
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,799
But they, so they came along to this first meeting, and KPMG prepared a whole lot of information about,

213
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,340
you know, where the assets were and blah, blah, blah. And then we had another meeting six months

214
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,539
later, and then Michael said to them, well, remember the last meeting? And they all looked

215
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:59,220
blankly and couldn't remember anything from the previous meeting. You know, the first couple of

216
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,159
years, we'd meet twice a year, and then they suddenly became interested. Well, I say suddenly

217
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,220
after two or three years, and they're more and more interested. Now we meet four times a year,

218
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,580
as a family council, to look at our philanthropic interests as well as our business interests and try

219
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,100
and look at Baker Slider's owners. So we just had a three-day retreat in Canada last month to do a

220
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,500
sort of high-level review of where we want to go with the business and where we want to go with

221
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,480
our other investments and our philanthropy. So it was fantastic. But if you don't do those,

222
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:38,340
put in the time and start early, like the kids were in their 20s when we started. They're now

223
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,220
both in their 40s.

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,259
And it's working, I think, very well. You know, they've taken control. I'm chairman of the board.

225
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Leslie's on the board as well. We go to the office for other things. I'm going to office today for a

226
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,480
separate meeting, nothing to do with Baker's Delight. And that's more often the reason I'm

227
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,039
there for other things rather than Baker's Delight. So it's worked well. But get in early if you want

228
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:07,740
to do succession plans. When we were in Canada, we also went to this business association meeting,

229
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,200
so family business association.

230
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,220
I don't know how often it happens, but it happened to be on where we were there and our son's on the

231
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,240
board of it. So he said, come along. And amongst the various presenters, there were a whole lot of

232
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,779
families presenting. Some stories were good and some not so good. There was one fellow there.

233
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,519
He said, oh, yeah, I got cancer in 2007 and I thought I better do something about my succession

234
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,259
planning. I'm just getting started now in 2022. That's a horror story. You know, the guy's in his

235
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,220
70s and just getting started. It's just, you know, it's a horror story.

236
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,820
It's crazy.

237
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:44,879
Well, it's really generous of you to share that story because, you know, family is personal and

238
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,639
yours is such a great example. But we also know families that achieve success, particularly,

239
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,559
you know, high net worth families, the complexity. And there are horror stories out there everywhere,

240
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,820
aren't there? And you would have seen them in the community where siblings, you know,

241
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,320
turn on each other. And so what you're saying is initially you weren't going to try and convince

242
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,000
them to be part of Baker's Delight. It was just about planning and giving them a line of sight on

243
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,580
every area of the family.

244
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,419
Yeah, yeah. Because if something happened to Leslie and I, well, I had a bunch of assets that they had

245
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,820
to look after and philanthropic commitments that they had to follow through. So, you know,

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,659
they're equally, you know, there's our daughter-in-law who's not in the business, but

247
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:30,500
she sits on family council. She's equally committed to all of our philanthropic endeavors as our

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,720
two children and our son-in-law. So, but it's been a gradual evolving process. It's not something

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,179
that we've forced on them.

250
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,639
Continuing to own Baker's Delight, that was a conscious decision by them and it's a conscious

251
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,220
decision again as of last month that they want to stay as owners. Whether they stay as executives,

252
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,960
that's up to them in the next few years. But for now, they're executives and they're owners.

253
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,279
So, that could change in the future, the executive part, but ownership is very clear in their minds.

254
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,840
So, you've got to be clear on what your role is, whether you're an owner, whether you're an

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,200
executive.

256
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,279
Or whether you just want to sit on the beach and take in the dividend. None of us are that

257
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,879
way inclined.

258
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,240
And I suppose there'll be people listening to this where they'll say, you know, it's

259
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,059
a potentially an easy to scale. I would argue against that actually, that often it gets

260
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,600
more complex with more assets and more things. But I'm sitting here listening going, it's

261
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,919
a good message for, you know, a father of four and at whatever level it is to include,

262
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,080
you know, not wait until tragedy or the end, isn't it? To start those conversations now

263
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,919
around sharing.

264
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Yeah.

265
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,159
And family council can happen at any level, doesn't it? You don't have to have enormous

266
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,159
assets to distribute.

267
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,159
No, exactly.

268
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,200
So, it's a great message to pass on. And part of your profile, I understand, was the

269
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,340
Myer Foundation's Leadership Institute. And you were promoting responsible leadership

270
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,120
and ethical practices. You were part of that. It was inspired by the Aspen Institute in

271
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
the US.

272
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
That's right.

273
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,759
You know, who recognized there was a lot more focus on management rather than great leadership.

274
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,759
Can you tell me about your passion for ethical leadership?

275
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:15,519
Yeah, I don't know where that comes from other than seeing unethical leadership. You

276
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,759
know, that's sort of my inspiration is to say, well, no, there's got to be a better

277
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,840
way. And I served on the Kranlana board for 20 years until it was merged with Monash University

278
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,759
a few years ago. And that's the Myer spin-off you're making reference to. And I stayed on

279
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,279
that because I believed in what they were doing as an enterprise and that there needed

280
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,559
to be more ethical training.

281
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,919
There's a lot of ethical training, particularly in big companies, but it happens in small

282
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,720
companies as well. People do the wrong thing. They cheat on suppliers. They give out the

283
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,820
wrong information. They tell one supplier what another one's doing and that sort of

284
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:58,519
stuff. And it's just bad for everybody. It doesn't end well. So I'm motivated to see

285
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,279
more people behaving ethically because it's better for everybody. It's the basis of the

286
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,360
win-win philosophy. You know, it's just so simple to do things properly and look after

287
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,080
people probably and live ethically. If you don't, I think it's a bad way to live.

288
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,299
And Roger, that's the basis for this podcast. What you said then effectively is trying to

289
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,799
share stories around what we think great leadership looks like. And we think a real

290
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:31,200
shift around more people understanding what you got early on and that is ethical leadership and

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,039
the idea of being self-reflective and collaborative and wanting to pass on and share and learn from

292
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:42,720
each other as well is our stories worth telling because you sometimes zoom out and you see

293
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
globally, we've got examples of leadership that's heading the other way as well. And we know it has

294
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,019
a devastating effect on people. You work in a business where someone hasn't got a sense of

295
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,580
great leadership, but can be a horrible thing for people, can't it? I've never worked in

296
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:04,519
such an environment, but I imagine it would be horrible. And I've seen it from a distance.

297
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,960
And then you look at...

298
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:12,660
What's happening in the world now with Ukraine and Russia, it's just, it's horrible as all wars

299
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,059
are, but it's unnecessary as well. And there's no reason for it other than one man being a

300
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,059
megalomaniac is what I'd say, but there's no ethics there.

301
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:24,599
And devastating.

302
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,660
Bad ethics and devastating outcomes.

303
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,579
Yeah. It's horrible. Often when you sit down for a podcast, Roger, you do what I just did. It's like

304
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,019
700 stores and great success and family planning. And...

305
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:40,880
That overlooks the bumps and the hurdles along the way, which there has to be many. I mean,

306
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,619
can you share one? Was there a famous time where you think, God, I made a blue there or a mistake

307
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,960
or one that you had to rectify?

308
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,380
One that springs to mind, it must be 15 years ago now. For some reason, we got investigated by the

309
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:03,799
ACCC. There's some franchisees accused us of doing the wrong thing. And the ACCC did this investigation.

310
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,859
And in the end, the...

311
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:14,200
We were exonerated. There was nothing to have to fess up about. But it was a horrible thing because

312
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,880
we knew we hadn't done anything wrong. But these other people who thought we had, or for whatever

313
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,640
reason, complained to the ACCC and it was enough for them to do this investigation. But in the end,

314
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,019
we got this very nice long letter, which we had framed and hung in our office for a few years.

315
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,700
And since we've renovated, that's disappeared.

316
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:35,660
But it was a...

317
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:42,200
A fantastic response from the then head of the ACCC. So that's one thing that sticks in my mind.

318
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,460
Other horrible situations where franchisees get sick and die, horrible.

319
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:50,640
Yeah.

320
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:57,940
But it's just, that's life. We met a widow of a franchisee in Canada just last month. This fellow

321
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,240
died only a few months ago. When he started his training about three or four years ago to become

322
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,200
a franchisee, he was perfectly...

323
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,839
Well, just as he opened his bakery, he was diagnosed with some sort of cancer. Then he was

324
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:18,700
treated, overcome, and then it came back three years later and he died. But horrible. But it's

325
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,240
nothing to do with us. It's just that you live in a community of hundreds or thousands of people

326
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,859
within our business. Things are likely to go wrong. People... There's another one I was talking about

327
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:34,900
recently. A fellow had three bakeries, it'd be 15, 20 years ago, and became a gambler,

328
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:35,640
lost his money. He was a gambler. He was a gambler. He was a gambler. He was a gambler. He was a gambler.

329
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,539
everything his wife his daughter you know estranged from him lost his bakeries lost everything and

330
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,000
two million dollars down the drain horrible but you can't do anything about it other than

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,180
you know help restore the businesses that are serving that community that the people lived in

332
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,819
and that's what we did we were able to find new franchisees for those businesses and

333
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:05,839
everything resumed normality in that particular town and now it's a booming area with a few more

334
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,339
bakeries in that area so it's fantastic to do it but when you're in the middle of a horrible

335
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:16,539
situation like that it's just it's where you've got to stand up and be decisive and do what's

336
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,720
right for everyone involved you can't just live in hope and you know pull the blanket over your

337
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,119
head and think well that'll pass you know it doesn't pass you've got to make things pass you've

338
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,799
got to say well that's not

339
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:40,980
right so we're going to fix it and life isn't about an absence of challenges isn't it it's

340
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,619
they're there and you i could see your mind going how many do you want because of course that that's

341
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,859
the truth but you can feel your sense of values kick in and it's like how do we do the right thing

342
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,619
in whatever situation uh arises and so yeah i appreciate i don't know whether it's just in me

343
00:20:54,619 --> 00:21:01,019
but i tend to forget the bad things and remember the good ones you know like uh my wife and i have

344
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,240
a breakfast every day we get our computers out and see how sales are going around the

345
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,400
world and we've just opened a bunch of new bakeries in canada and they're doing remarkably

346
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,420
well so we zoom in on them so how they're going and yeah and then occasionally go what about the

347
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,940
ones that are not going so well so we better have a look at them as well but you focus on the good

348
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,779
news and then make that happen more that's amazing how much the the bad news can just sort of not

349
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,240
someone's got to do something about it and fix you know if the bakery's a bit slow we've got to put

350
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,119
in more effort to make it happen but the the good news sticks in your mind more and that's

351
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,519
practice isn't it you've got a smile on your face from the moment i met you in the lift a moment ago

352
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,359
and i i said and that is a practice you can actually put into play can't you actually spend

353
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,279
more time i mean you know if you pick up the daily news feed and you focus on that that that's going

354
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,180
to drive you mad because that's full of negative news but the joy is there in front of you if you

355
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,720
if you celebrate it can i ask you a quick question on on scale because it happened you opened the

356
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,359
first 15 bakeries yourself and you had a few partners and then you bought them out and and

357
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,220
uh and decided to open the first 15 bakeries and then you opened the first 15 bakeries and then you

358
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,019
decided that from 1988 you're going to have a look at the franchising world which was coming

359
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:17,599
into play with some american multinationals but from 1988 to 91 you went from 15 to 43 stores and

360
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:24,299
then in two years 91 to 93 you went from 43 to 200 yeah and then 10 years later you added another

361
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:31,420
400 stores in 10 years i mean that is incredible scale yeah what was the secret to that um basic

362
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,579
profitability and that attracted people to the business

363
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,539
and it was a fantastic atmosphere for people to work in because so we had a lot of friends and

364
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:48,660
family uh one stage we had about five different bank managers who um saw what we're doing and

365
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,599
left the bank and became uh franchisees they've all moved on since but it was just success bred

366
00:22:54,599 --> 00:23:02,279
success the old story so um when you're on a roll you've got to roll fast you know when you're on a

367
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,759
good thing stick to it if you're not on it get on it it's uh

368
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,319
it's simple um and we're doing that in canada now like we want to we're putting the foot down

369
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,039
it's one of the things we decided last month we want to uh have 700 stores in north america

370
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,539
as soon as we can get them probably by 2030 and we've got 160 odd there now

371
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:28,940
uh we want to add another couple hundred in australia so um why not why not i love it and

372
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,119
i love the story of your bank managers and who left the bank and you know looked at it and said

373
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,839
this is a better opportunity for me

374
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,680
um another you know brilliant story of of success roger i've been asking a range of

375
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,460
different leaders from different areas sport and industry like yourself or from the art social

376
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,940
venture around what we see dimensions of what great leadership looks like that we've been

377
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,319
identifying across the course of this podcast and through the leadership business uh that i'm part

378
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,640
of with a leader and we start with self-leadership we think everyone who's got a sense of uh of great

379
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,720
leadership understands their own self-leadership does that term resonate with you

380
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,960
it means being responsible for yourself and for whatever else you're committed to whether it's

381
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,240
being a director in a company whether it's being a manager whatever it is whether it's being a

382
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,859
father husband uh you got to be what that role you know says you should be and what you think

383
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:31,019
you should be as a husband father uh manager director whatever uh and being aware that you've

384
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,079
got to fulfill those responsibilities i don't take anything on if i can't be

385
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,920
responsible for whatever it is and i do a lot of different things so and i'm lucky that i get asked

386
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:48,619
to do these different things but it's it's exciting uh and it's easy to take on new challenges if you

387
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:54,279
get excited by the opportunity um if it doesn't excite you don't do it uh and i don't mean

388
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:01,759
excitement you know lucky or achieve at a party or you know it's it's true to your own uh feelings

389
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,220
belief values to say well no that fits in with what i'm doing i'm not going to do that i'm not

390
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,339
you know like i would never become a director of a casino uh but i'd be a director of a range of

391
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:19,039
different other things as i am but so it's got to fit your values um and push your own buttons

392
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,720
so yeah well that that energizes me it doesn't and it challenges me uh and it's always a challenge

393
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,420
to say well to take on a new role um but if after a little while it's not working for you well

394
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,000
do something about it either find out why it's not

395
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,140
working for you why it's you can't be bothered reading the board papers or why you can't be

396
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,720
bothered going to a meeting and i don't experience that everything i'm involved in i'll stick to and

397
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,099
do it as well as i can if i start losing interest that's when i put my hand up and say i've done

398
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:57,140
enough time to move on pretty clear thinking roger the way you approach uh things in life you

399
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,500
can you can have that sense and that that you know description of self-leadership uh you know

400
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,599
all the various interests that you've got we see leaders a very uh the 21st century leaders who

401
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,240
are having an impact roger very conscious of how they positively impact everyone in their environment

402
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,559
i mean clearly that's a huge part of baker's delight success i mean how did you think about

403
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:28,059
the positive impact on others well i think it came from the understanding the win-win

404
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:35,059
formula or philosophy you know a long time ago and how if you face your

405
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,519
life optimistically and then say well this person i'm talking to to potentially become an employee

406
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:49,200
a franchisee or whatever the relationship is fits the bill you know they're they're the right fit

407
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,079
if they don't not the right fit will you end the conversation say thanks for coming

408
00:26:53,079 --> 00:27:00,759
but if you got the right people it's more likely to be a successful outcome but if you've got the

409
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:05,220
wrong people forget it so you just got to keep looking for the right people

410
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,039
to do the right job it's a common theme that i've you know in different spheres isn't it and

411
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,519
there's lots of ways to describe it but you know everyone has that experience i know

412
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:20,859
finding bakers is always a you know a lifetime challenge for you the expansion's there but it's

413
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:25,180
finding the right uh people who've got that constitution too to get up at two o'clock in

414
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,000
the morning isn't it yeah yeah and they've got to be happy to do what we're doing and it's the

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,859
same with franchisees that if they don't love the business it's not going to work

416
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,559
we see ladies are really conscious about how they create and share the vision that they've got

417
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,920
baker's delight at a really clear vision i mean we heard you talk about a family retreat you know

418
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,400
recently how have you gone about creating and sharing that vision well over the years until

419
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,180
covid hit um we've had annual conferences uh we've got one now coming up in september

420
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,900
you know on the gold coast we'll have hundreds of people there that's about you know sharing

421
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,119
the culture as well as you know having some

422
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,920
motivational speakers and others but it's just talking about what we do and then getting

423
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,779
like-minded people together from all around the country and maybe from other countries we operate

424
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:22,619
in to just share their their vision and and view we were due to have our a conference celebrate our

425
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:29,500
40th anniversary you know two years ago covid put an end to that and we wrote a little book about it

426
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,519
as well called delightful um we've since given that book to all the franchisees but it was going

427
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,339
to be that conference but it's all about you know understanding and deepening their relationships

428
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:47,700
with everyone the network as much as we can uh so we have all sorts of get-togethers whether

429
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,519
i call them pod groups so it's an area manager we'll have 20 or 30 franchisees they get together

430
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,380
and talk about their business what the challenges are how things are working not working and there's

431
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,720
just a range of different ways of getting people together uh we do a news letter every week called

432
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,220
crumbs uh goes to the network and we've got a lot of people that are getting together and we've got a lot of people that are getting

433
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,519
everyone the network there's an australian edition a new zealand edition and a north american edition

434
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:16,319
um and that's all put together by the local people in each region uh so it's just a range

435
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:24,240
of different things to do to celebrate success and commiserate any bumps along the way it sounds

436
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,460
like you've systemized that though just listening to the language that you genuinely you know and

437
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,400
and the pod groups you know around 20 is that sort of where you felt the the maximum amount was well

438
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,279
it depends on an area manager how many bakeries are in their patch so that

439
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,579
maybe a smaller number because the uh there's two or three people that own two or three bakeries so

440
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:52,299
it's uh could be 30 bakeries in most of them but could be 20 franchisees or 25 or 30 depending on

441
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:58,880
how many multi-store operators there are roger we see leaders uh the word curiosity comes up a lot

442
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,180
that the great leaders like you are are very curious and through that curiosity they're

443
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,220
constantly wanting to learn and they're constantly wanting to learn and they're constantly wanting to

444
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,160
learn and improve does this curiosity resonate with you oh coming into this new building here

445
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,960
and seeing this studio i'm very curious you know i'd love to have a look around when we're finished

446
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,500
to just understand how it works i've just i see cranes work all along when i say well how does

447
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:26,019
that work i'm just forever curious i can't understand enough you know see things growing

448
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:30,579
why does that plant grow quicker than that one i'm just this you can take on too much of a burden

449
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:35,220
of inquiry but curiosity i think it's funny saying curiosity can be a bit of a burden of inquiry but

450
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:43,480
it's not a negative and it shouldn't be curiosity is what has made humanity the success we are you

451
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,740
know the human ingenuity there's no end to it you know we have these squabbles which is horrible in

452
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,920
you know we said earlier in ukraine and russia but it's tiny compared to the seven billion people

453
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,500
living on the world or seven half however many we've got the progress that humanity's made you

454
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,900
know we're in the flight path in hawthorne you've probably seen the planes come over your area as

455
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,160
you think about that 100 years ago there was no international no jet airplanes nothing now

456
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:19,079
there's millions every day flying in 1918 there were no deaths in commercial aircraft

457
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:24,880
anywhere in the world and for what that one year there's been dead since because unfortunately that

458
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,059
max i think the boeing plane killed a few people but it's such a safe industry millions and millions

459
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,559
every day flying somewhere

460
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,819
and i'm curious about that i'll just i love it i've got a pilot's license myself but i'll just

461
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:47,099
the miracle of flight you know it's just and then all the other things that happen in our world you

462
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:52,019
wake up in the morning hit a bit of plastic on the wall the light comes on then you go to your

463
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,119
bathroom and someone's delivered fresh water for you you know these are miracles that we just take

464
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:03,279
for granted every day but it's bloody fantastic 100 years ago wasn't there like my father was

465
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,160
born in 24 uh 1914

466
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,900
only 30 years after electricity started being generated like the change that's happened for the

467
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:17,420
invention of electricity is just miraculous so curiosity is just fantastic and

468
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:24,720
put petrol on that fire of curiosity don't kill the cat i love your enthusiasm for it i can feel

469
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,859
it in your in your body like my mom as you were talking uh roger my mom was going to kevin sheedy

470
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:35,000
the great uh richmond and essendon the afl legend as he is sheeds and and hearing him say

471
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,220
once and i was like oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die

472
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,160
you know they only put wheels on suitcases about 30 years ago we used to carry those

473
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,400
things around on our backs you know someone sat there and worked out it might be smarter to wheel

474
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,480
them you know and you take that for granted there's there's simple opportunities in everything

475
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,839
we do uh communicating with clarity uh roger we see leaders are really conscious you know

476
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,619
particularly with a scale business like yours we heard the crumbs newsletter and and and clearly

477
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,019
there's a strategy on it can you share with us about how you've gone about communicating

478
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,500
in addition to win-win you know constant improvement is you know a theme of ours that

479
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,380
so if you're doing one thing why can't you do it better so always looking for ways of improving

480
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:25,799
communication so um and improving everything so but the you know i forget when we started doing

481
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:34,079
the crumbs newsletter um 30 years ago i suppose but and we catalog every edition so that someone

482
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,220
wants to reference back to it i think it's a good idea i think it's a good idea i think it's a good

483
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,539
idea i think it's a good idea i think it's a good idea i think it's a good idea i think it's a good

484
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:48,119
idea but it's communication by word is one thing via spirit is the other you know and i like to

485
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,019
think the baker's light spirit is the thing that keeps us going you know that pledge to delight

486
00:33:53,019 --> 00:34:00,240
every customer and how do you communicate that other than through action it's not words it's just

487
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,079
someone you know you get a young junior in one of our bakeries in glenfrey road horse on the

488
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,199
one uh 16 year old coming in for a shirt first shift she does some preliminary training but the

489
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:17,920
real training is there on the job and she finds one of the other team members who she respects and

490
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:26,900
looks up to or heed and they follow no words just they listen and follow uh it's so communication

491
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:35,139
is very multi-layered um it's not just words uh it's spirit it's following it's

492
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:42,019
listening um it's a whole range of things and just keeping you know your focus on where you're

493
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:47,800
trying to go and making the best of whatever the situation is constant improvement yeah

494
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,500
beautifully uh beautifully said uh how important has collaboration been i mean ultimately important

495
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,019
is it you don't get to the scale that baker's delight has without wanting to collaborate and

496
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,599
and share how have you gone about that collaboration how important is it

497
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,199
utmost important

498
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,159
it's because i'm a baker my wife's a science graduate when we started we did everything

499
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,599
ourselves then things get more complicated can't do the finance so you got to get kpmg you can't

500
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,679
do computers so you got to get a tech person and and then our suppliers we collaborate with them

501
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:30,579
to make sure we buy enough you know product of every year and get enough into the warehouses

502
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:35,219
so it can be distributed and it's awfully complicated uh you know it's

503
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:41,860
to get flour and all the other ingredients to the bakery twice a week uh in all of those

504
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,679
locations when there's floods and the collaboration is just when we had floods in

505
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:54,239
queensland recently there was one flour rep there who drove an extra 200 miles or 200 kilometers

506
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:01,780
just to get a few bags of flour to one of our franchisees so i rang uh when i heard this story

507
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,079
i rang dick haran who owns manila flour mills

508
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:12,440
and uh he answered the phone put on speaker he said good day roger i'm here in brisbane oh good

509
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,940
on you dick because i've just rung to thank you to pass on our thanks to i don't even know the

510
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:23,980
guy's name who went out of his way to deliver that flour and he said well he's here sitting

511
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,360
next to me just heard what you said and johnny you know dick's son was there as well so like

512
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,019
we've got that relationship and it's easy to collaborate so manila come up with new ideas

513
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,679
make our bread better they've formulated the i don't know whether you buy the high low loaf

514
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:46,440
i do yes absolutely manila was collaboration with them to come up with a formula to produce that

515
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,579
and to improve it what we're doing now is different to what we started with whenever we started but

516
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:57,900
it's every aspect of our businesses collaboratively you know whether it's with marketing agencies

517
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,219
technical bakers we have our own tech bakers but they work with other people to produce new

518
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,159
products it's just

519
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,480
all over the place and you see your range improving it was a self-indulgent question

520
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,860
they're coming up uh here roger as a celiac uh gluten-free bread so i i i walk past and i smell

521
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:23,079
the bakers delight joy and i go yeah it's not and we know that's a you know a much more expanded

522
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,260
spa i suppose that's hard when you've got non-gluten free have you thought about entering

523
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,400
that space at all we have but it's as you would know it's less than one percent of the market

524
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,920
yeah very small and

525
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:42,480
it has to be in a sterile environment so we can't make gluten-free products in on site yeah yeah and

526
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,059
then to bring it in it's just not what we do so we'll leave that to the specialist

527
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:53,619
i'm highly disappointed but i have to pass that on yeah yeah because the uh the convenience and

528
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:58,380
the fresh bread coming out of your bakery with the pills i understand why you can't do it but

529
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,360
asking um these two questions uh you know the empowering leaders podcast is is the title of uh

530
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,219
of the conversation we're going to be talking about is the empowering leaders podcast and we're going to be

531
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:14,119
having roger who in your life has been the greatest leader uh to personally i've been in your the

532
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,699
greatest leader and influence in your life well uh my first thought before i saw that clarification

533
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:25,639
was nelson mandela um and because our son son-in-law south african we've been to south

534
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:32,440
africa a few times but uh but not while he was in power um but probably uh my wife

535
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,219
uh without thinking about any further

536
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:45,820
she's um so clear in her thinking so decisive such a strong moral compass um

537
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:54,619
inspirational from health and fitness perspective uh everything about her yeah it's a great answer

538
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:59,900
roger that smile's booming as you as you say i love you and mandela i can clearly the values

539
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,179
and the and the history and i i love asking that question because you know he's a question without

540
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,219
notice and people immediately i'm like oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry

541
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:10,599
you know that to get the instinct but you know i suppose uh you know to have a partnership like

542
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,059
that you know of all the things that you've achieved i often think the same if you're

543
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:19,239
fortunate enough to have a an incredible uh life partner it's about as good a gift as you can get

544
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:25,400
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah i'm very lucky in the sense of collaboration roger we're obsessed with what

545
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,940
collaboration looks like if i could ask you that if you collaborate with anyone you've got a range

546
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,940
of incredible uh that make us delight clearly and your philanthropy and we haven't really touched

547
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:40,599
dcna and a number of other causes that i know you get behind if you collaborate with anyone on

548
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,519
anything does someone spring to mind uh we're involved in a thing called the world mosquito

549
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,800
program and we work closely with the director of that who's an australian he lives in france

550
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,420
world mosquito program will eliminate dengue fever from the world 390 million people a year

551
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,639
get dengue fever out of four billion people are exposed to it so it's a global problem

552
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,239
a permanent pandemic but they've this fellow called professor scott o'neill has come up with

553
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:21,000
a way to deal with it um i won't go to the detail here but he is an inspiration uh he's been able to

554
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,159
get the gates foundation on board um and many other welcome trusts from england and many other

555
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:34,320
supporters including our family foundation so we talk with him once a month um whenever he's here

556
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,880
we catch up with him uh we've been to

557
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:43,099
indonesia colombia vietnam uh to look at the work as well as you know it's big labs at monash

558
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:51,960
so he's a great collaborator um and we've seen him collaborate with various people around the

559
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,619
world from all levels of government uh because that project works in 12 different countries now

560
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,920
from brazil colombia and south america panama uh all the pacific island nations australia is now

561
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,840
free uh india

562
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:14,360
indonesia vietnam um you know but it goes on so that's but when you talk about collaboration you

563
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,739
know i'd love to be able to collaborate with um warren buffett we own a few shares in uh warren

564
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:26,460
buffett's you know berkshire hathaway but what a unbelievable guy 91 he's still investing a

incredible what a guy you know i could just uh

567
