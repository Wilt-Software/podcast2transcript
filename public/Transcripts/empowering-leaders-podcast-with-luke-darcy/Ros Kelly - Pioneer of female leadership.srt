A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:53,100
Ros Kelly, in many ways, is a pioneer of female leadership

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,380
in Australian public life.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,759
Graduating from the University of Sydney with a teaching degree,

14
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,659
Ros became the first person on either side of her family

15
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,679
to complete tertiary education.

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,920
Initially working for five years as a secondary school teacher,

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,079
Ros's first entry into public life saw her elected

18
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,120
to the ACT House of Assembly as the member for Canberra in 1974.

19
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,239
Ros Kelly was elected to the House of Representatives

20
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,120
and became the first Australian federal MP

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,959
to give birth to a child.

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,540
In 1987, Ros became the first female Labor Minister

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,980
when appointed Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel.

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,819
Post-political life, Ros Kelly's leadership has seen her succeed

25
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,459
in the business world as Chair of the National Breast Cancer Foundation,

26
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,739
appointed by the Queen to the Commonwealth War Graves Board

27
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,980
and awarded an Order of Australia in 2004

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
for her service to the community, environment and women's health.

29
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,180
Ros, it's a great honour and privilege to spend some time with you.

30
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:46,799
Thanks for joining me.

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,700
Thank you, Luke.

32
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,799
Anything I can do for work,

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,040
women, I do.

34
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,799
That, I think, is the first lesson for women like me

35
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,319
that we've got to be there to support other women.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, you created so many firsts, Ros,

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,579
and paved the way for female leaders in Australian public life.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,120
When you look back, and I'll read that back to you,

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,219
is there a sense of pride?

40
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,199
There is a great sense of pride,

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,759
but sometimes I look back and I say,

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,060
did I really do all that?

43
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,080
And I think this is the point we need to make

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,939
right at the beginning,

45
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,800
that when we set out,

46
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,219
as particularly as women,

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,280
I didn't set out to be a cabinet minister.

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,400
I set out a step at a time

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,580
to first of all get to university

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,900
because I knew if I didn't get to university,

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,439
I didn't have the education I needed to go forward.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,479
So, one, you've got to get the education.

53
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,240
Two, when I was teaching, I loved it,

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,879
but I felt I wasn't developing enough.

55
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,460
So then the next step,

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,900
I saw this opportunity to get,

57
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,259
I got involved in politics.

58
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,340
And then, so everything was then,

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,759
I did, first of all, did the ACT assembly.

60
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,259
And then I got into the House of Representatives.

61
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,379
Now that sounds easy,

62
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:01,659
but in those days,

63
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,719
there were no women in the House of Representatives,

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
none, none.

65
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,240
And the only reason I ran for pre-selection

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,759
for the seat of Canberra,

67
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,800
which was then held as a conservative seat,

68
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,879
was because I looked around and I thought,

69
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,520
is there any other woman that's got a chance of winning this?

70
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:19,599
And no.

71
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,780
So everything has been one step at a time,

72
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,000
seeing the opportunity and going for it.

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,240
And that's the real lesson we've got to say.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,939
You're not going to actually always set your heights

75
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,620
as the ultimate.

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,139
Let's just take it a step at a time,

77
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,099
learn how we go as we go,

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,639
and then take that next,

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,719
whenever the chance is there, go for it.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,460
Ros, can you take us back to the environment

81
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,800
of the late 70s, early 80s,

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,840
when you are running for public office?

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,759
And what,

84
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,680
what it was like?

85
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,780
You know, read with interest that the advice for you

86
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,060
to appeal to the electorate was that you needed to be

87
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,300
the mother with a roast lamb in the oven.

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,620
And that image needed to be portrayed

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,620
because that's what, you know, the electorate wanted.

90
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,659
But at the same time,

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,300
as a young mother returning back to parliament,

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,819
you were widely criticised for not being a proper mum

93
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,520
because how could you do both those things at the same time?

94
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,740
And how did you stay sane

95
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,080
with all that pressure going on from all angles?

96
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,600
So this, again, is you've got to be true to yourself.

97
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,860
And,

98
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,019
you've got to believe in yourself.

99
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,160
So the first step for me was the hardest one.

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
And that was running for federal parliament.

101
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,420
Because when I made that move,

102
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,040
I really thought that I would wreck my first marriage.

103
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:37,259
And I did.

104
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,439
But I still,

105
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,060
because I knew that that partner was not accepting

106
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,879
of me continuing to grow in that way.

107
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,959
But then I said,

108
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,839
I said to myself,

109
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,759
this might sound bizarre to now,

110
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,199
I don't want to get to 40 and feel I should have done it.

111
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,639
I wanted to have a go at it.

112
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,939
And if I failed,

113
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,459
well, you know, the consequence,

114
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,540
at least I've experienced it.

115
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,079
So that's why I ran for federal parliament,

116
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,620
because I thought it was a very, very hard step.

117
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
And remember in the previous parliament,

118
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,339
there were no women.

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,939
So there was no sort of stereotype.

120
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,699
There was no stereotype view of how you behave.

121
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,259
So this is, again, this problem for women.

122
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,019
You can't do it like the men do it.

123
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,779
But on the other hand, like Julia experienced,

124
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,660
there are aspects of it that the community can't deal with.

125
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,899
So for me, I was in a marriage that was difficult.

126
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,079
I had no children at that stage.

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,139
And, but the,

128
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,920
and I did some survey work to see what people thought of me.

129
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,759
And,

130
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,759
and I found that about 8%, this was Canberra.

131
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,600
So they're very enlightened.

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
8% said, we don't care whether you're a man or a woman.

133
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,279
So that's right.

134
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,220
8% said they wanted a woman,

135
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,819
about 8% said they wanted a man.

136
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,540
And the rest of them said they didn't care.

137
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,779
But what they did say is they said they,

138
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,100
I seem to be an expert on things,

139
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,680
but they didn't know anything about me.

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
So my secret weapon became my Cocker Spaniel dog.

141
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,560
So my dog and I went everywhere together.

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,680
And the theme was again, more of a related to women.

143
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,540
It was Rose Kelly Cares for Canberra.

144
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,620
So this was the beginning of that sort of culture

145
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,879
of leadership where women are more caring.

146
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,060
And I'm not saying, I mean, that's not,

147
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,500
all women aren't like that, but that's the way I am.

148
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,660
And that style of leadership is very hard to fit

149
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,060
into the parliament, which is very natural and very

150
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,100
aggressive.

151
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,540
So that became a big issue in the future.

152
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,019
Ros, I want to come back.

153
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,379
When we spoke on the phone, you mentioned that you want to talk about choosing the right

154
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:56,980
partner in life.

155
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,180
I'd love to come back to that discussion because you touched on it briefly there, but it is

156
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,540
an under-discussed element in life and leadership, and I'd love to explore that with you further.

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,839
But I just want to go back a bit to that time and you breaking new ground, as you said,

158
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,740
there were no women.

159
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,259
They just didn't exist.

160
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,220
You're there.

161
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,060
What the environment was like for you, I read that there was only one time you felt compelled

162
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,819
to take the floor of parliament, following a comment from the MP, I think it was Michael

163
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,540
Hodgman at the time, who said something misogynistic and sexist.

164
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,639
And you took the stand and you said, I'm a woman.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
Women are here to stay.

166
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,879
We demand the same respect as every other member of this house.

167
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,699
That was a stand that you took.

168
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,980
What was it like for you in politics at the time?

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,620
I'll never forget that day.

170
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,860
My legs were actually shaking.

171
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,779
I was so nervous because the whole...

172
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,019
Normally.

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,399
They will scream and yell at you.

174
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,060
But I stood up and I said, I want to make a personal explanation.

175
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,759
And everything went quiet.

176
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,720
And I made that point about, you know, we just demand to be treated fairly like everybody else.

177
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,800
Because he had made a misogynist comment.

178
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,560
And I let it go at the time because I was sort of thinking, you know, what do I let it go?

179
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,399
And then I saw it in the handset and I thought, no, no, I can't let this go.

180
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,920
But I remember my first time I got into parliament.

181
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,899
We were in the old parliament.

182
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,740
And there were two other women with me.

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,360
Joan Child, who was an older lady, a lovely woman from Victoria.

184
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,300
And Elaine Darling from Queensland.

185
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,100
Both a bit older than me.

186
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,620
Anyway, the three of us were in the House of Representatives in the old chamber.

187
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,139
And one of my colleagues came along.

188
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,559
And on top note, as the parliament's about to assemble for the first time, he looked at and was sitting next to Joan.

189
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,960
And he said, geez, he said, not bad enough having you sheilers here.

190
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,059
Well, I've got to sit next to one of you.

191
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,259
So that's really what it was like.

192
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,820
And but it's been like that in everything I've done.

193
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,620
And I think it will be to many of you listeners, too.

194
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,559
I mean, the House of Representatives is one thing.

195
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,159
But then you move on.

196
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,639
And it's the first time I was, you know, my first portfolio was junior defence minister.

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,379
There'd never been a woman defence minister.

198
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:16,700
So you had to get in.

199
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,840
Then you had to prove yourself again, prove you could do the job.

200
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,559
And I remember I went on my first exercise.

201
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,320
That is a military exercise in the Northern Territory.

202
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,460
It was called Operation Dusty Trooper.

203
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,659
So we went up to Operation Dusty Trooper.

204
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,320
And all day I noticed people, the soldiers, going around a little circle.

205
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:46,340
And I remember the brigadier kept saying to me, a minister, would you like to use the facilities?

206
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,919
Stupid me, didn't know what they were.

207
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,179
Until later in the day, I said, oh, yeah, there's a toilet around.

208
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,919
Keep me a shovel.

209
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,559
And they said, oh, minister, we've made special arrangements for you.

210
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:03,360
And there in the middle of this area, a square, it did have Hessian around it, was a tin dunny.

211
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,460
And, of course, if you put your bottom on it, it was, you know, you jump.

212
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,120
And so you use the ground.

213
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,779
Afterwards, I came up and I said, brigadier.

214
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,179
I said, you do not have to make special arrangements.

215
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:18,919
From now on, just give me a shovel.

216
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,580
And, you know, it was just showing that you could do things in your own way.

217
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:30,919
You didn't have to do everything like the boys, but you had to prove yourself all the time, all the time.

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,500
And so whatever you do, women have to do that.

219
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,320
And they're still doing it.

220
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,840
That's the tragedy of our society today.

221
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,279
You can't just be accepted of who you are.

222
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,659
Although, I want to congratulate the new Albanese government.

223
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,659
Because there is, I think we've come a long way.

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,399
Because there's this wonderful young woman whom I mentored and helped in the campaign called Annika Wells, who's the member for Lilly.

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
And she's about 38.

226
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,720
She's got three young kids, a set of twins of one and another little one at five.

227
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:14,679
And I said to her, the big change will occur when you get offered a portfolio and you make the judgment on whether you can do it,

228
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,860
rather than be told.

229
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,419
I was often told I couldn't do it because I had two young kids.

230
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:29,279
And that's where I think we've improved things so much, that it's up to us to make the call, not for other boys, the boys around, to decide for us.

231
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,120
Ros, you mentioned off the top, if you can do anything that empowers women.

232
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,519
And in that spirit, Ros, a lot of this podcast to me is about we're seeing a great shift in leadership,

233
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,720
away from the hierarchy and the command and control and the boss who's got the corner.

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,820
And to more self-reflective and more collaborative.

235
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,080
And that obviously includes female leadership, because naturally, you said not all women, clearly,

236
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,919
but there is more empathy naturally with female leaders.

237
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,399
Is that the sort of shift that you're seeing in modern leadership yourself?

238
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:02,960
I hope so.

239
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,379
I don't think it applies everywhere.

240
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,500
After I left public life, I worked in the mining and construction industry.

241
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,460
I think there are still issues.

242
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,559
I think there are still issues.

243
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,559
We can't close our eyes and say everyone's into sort of coal.

244
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,159
We can't close our eyes and say everyone's into sort of coal.

245
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,179
We can't close our eyes and say everyone's into sort of coal.

246
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,679
So I think we need to take a step back and say to women,

247
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,019
what is the sort of leadership that is, is there such thing as a feminine leadership?

248
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,399
I think there is a leadership for you as an individual.

249
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,500
And some men will roll like this, but these are the ingredients of it.

250
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,620
I think that we, listen, I think women are good at that.

251
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,700
We consider, we act, and we communicate.

252
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,059
with passion but through all that I think we are resilient

253
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,139
and we recognise, I think women recognise that our type

254
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,559
of leadership is collaborative and we don't have the answers

255
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,220
to everything.

256
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
I think that's where we do change because there's so many men,

257
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,559
you know, who think they know everything but I don't think

258
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,159
I know any one woman who thinks she knows everything

259
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,440
and so I think we're very good at team building.

260
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,379
I think that is a great style of leadership we have.

261
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,059
Now, I'm not saying men can't do that.

262
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:27,059
I think my husband when he was running Westpac was a good team leader

263
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:30,620
recognising that, you know, you've got to build a team

264
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,320
but women particularly are very good at that and so I think

265
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
the best companies recognise that now.

266
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,059
Not all companies do but I think the best do.

267
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,639
The smartest ones are, aren't they, in understanding,

268
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,139
as you said, that it's not just ticking.

269
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,539
It's ticking your box.

270
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,379
It's the skill set that, you know, naturally occurs

271
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,820
in the feminine side of the world compared to the masculine

272
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,500
side of the world.

273
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,179
You mentioned briefly when we spoke about young girls

274
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,779
in the playground are natural leaders, you know,

275
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,159
and if you study before there's any perception placed

276
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,059
on young girls, is society sort of coaching that out

277
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,080
of young women?

278
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,580
We need to coach that back effectively.

279
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,620
Roz, is that the advice you give to young girls

280
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,559
who want to follow your path?

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,139
I think we need to.

282
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,960
I think we need to do a lot more work at the high school level.

283
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,019
Somehow we lose these girls in teenage years where they become

284
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,080
less secure in themselves.

285
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,580
It's really about being happy with who you are and, as you know,

286
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,360
there's so many pressures on boys and girls but so many girls

287
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,840
lose their sense of self in their teenage years and I loved being

288
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,120
a school teacher because I think there's so much we can do

289
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,179
with those young women at high school.

290
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,960
We don't, I mean, parents and parents have got to remember

291
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,080
they've got responsibilities as well but it really is high school

292
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,940
where I think so many of those girls have got to realise

293
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,159
that it's good being me, it's good being me and social media

294
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,740
is doing so much damage to their whole being, self-image

295
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,000
because you can't be a great leader if you don't believe in yourself.

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,100
That's so fundamental.

297
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,039
So every lesson that I've had along the way, as I said to you,

298
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,580
it's been a step at a time but I've believed in myself

299
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,940
and years and years ago I remember I was sitting

300
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,120
in a Labor Party forum and I was sitting next to this marvellous man

301
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,019
named Peter Walensky who was well known as a senior bureaucrat

302
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,620
and went on to be ambassador and head of foreign affairs.

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,620
And I was sitting next to him and I said,

304
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Peter, do you think I could run as secretary of the branch,

305
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,620
which is really where I started in public life?

306
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,200
And he looked at me and he said, Ros, I always say,

307
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,059
I look around the room and if I think I can do the job

308
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,679
at least as well as anyone else, I go for it.

309
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,220
And that's what I think we've got to say to all women,

310
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,480
young women and older women.

311
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,500
Have a go at this.

312
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,480
Have a go.

313
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:11,340
Have a go.

314
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,360
Have a go.

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,980
And it is.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
And it is critical that we keep having it,

317
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,259
encourage that when they're teenagers.

318
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,139
Yeah, great piece of advice, Ros.

319
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,279
And I think sometimes when I have the pleasure of sharing stories

320
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,740
like yours, Ros, people look at it and they say,

321
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:25,899
how could I do that?

322
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,700
Look at the success.

323
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,159
Look at all of the achievement and right from your early age.

324
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,360
But we often overlook the challenges along the way.

325
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,659
And you write very openly about your challenges

326
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,379
and building resilience along the way.

327
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,919
And you don't get to be the first female Labor Minister

328
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,000
of Australia without building some of that resilience.

329
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,820
Resilience.

330
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,679
And along with your success, there was a really tough ending

331
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,879
for you in politics.

332
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,019
It became known as the Whiteboard Affair.

333
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,519
You write about that in your book.

334
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,240
Can you share with the listeners your experience of that

335
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,279
and how you coped?

336
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,139
There was a lot of personal attacks on you at the time.

337
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,340
How did you cope with that?

338
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,659
See, I think in public life, you've got to sort of dissociate

339
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:06,059
the job from the person and probably you have to do

340
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:11,819
in other fields of work because I knew that I was,

341
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:11,980
you know, I was, you know, I was, you know,

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,039
I was allocating sports grants and to compare

343
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,660
with what's gone on recently.

344
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,400
I mean, I did give more to Labor seats than Liberal seats,

345
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,660
for sure, because they had greater need.

346
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,680
What I probably didn't do was have the proper paper chains.

347
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,720
And in the end of the day, the time I was attacked,

348
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:36,660
the way I got through that was to say this is really

349
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,259
about me, the politician, not about me, the person.

350
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,539
They never accused me of being corrupt.

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,180
Or they accused me of being political.

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,880
And so that's where I had to sort of dissociate

353
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,940
to keep myself intact.

354
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,299
And there was a huge amount of pressure because at the same time,

355
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:00,640
my husband, David, had moved to Sydney and he was working in Sydney.

356
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,859
So every morning I'd have to get the kids to school

357
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,960
and my little boy had moved to a new school.

358
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,180
So he'd be crying.

359
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,819
He'd cry while I was putting him into school for about half an hour.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,819
And I'd have to deal with him, then get into work

361
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,180
and deal with the latest little attack that was going on.

362
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,440
And I got asked every question in Parliament for three months.

363
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,400
Imagine the pressure of that.

364
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,900
And that you've just got to, unfortunately,

365
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,559
that's the sort of thing you've got to be able to deal with in public life.

366
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,960
And I think it's only got worse with social media.

367
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,059
But underpinning all that, you've got to say,

368
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,960
have you got this supportive relationship

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,859
and hold you together?

370
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,380
And that's where I think we go back to one of your earlier points, Luke,

371
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,119
which I think we should come back to,

372
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,339
how critical it is to have a good personal relationship.

373
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,980
And that might be your partner.

374
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,579
It might be your best friends.

375
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,960
But for me, it was obviously my husband,

376
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,339
but I had some great friends who helped me through that.

377
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,359
One of them was this fabulous Melburnian called Lindsay Fox.

378
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:07,500
Really?

379
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,099
Yeah, Lindsay used to ring me every morning,

380
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:11,920
every morning without fail.

381
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
While I was going through that.

382
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,619
And he'd just say, hi, Roz, just ringing to say I love you.

383
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:17,900
That was it.

384
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,559
And, you know, that was just so fabulous.

385
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
People helping you when you're down.

386
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,259
Another great guy.

387
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,019
And it is interesting that most of these were men.

388
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,200
Another great guy who's running a mining company.

389
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,200
And I'd met him, obviously, in the context of work.

390
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,019
And he rang me and he said, look, what you're going through,

391
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,339
I don't quite get it all.

392
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,980
But he said, I appreciate it.

393
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,779
I appreciate everything you've done.

394
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,960
And when this is over, if you want to leave public light,

395
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:49,440
I'd love to talk to you about things we can do together.

396
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Now, just having someone who in the middle of your depth

397
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
or the trouble you're going through to help to pull you up,

398
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,000
I've never forgotten that.

399
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,779
And I think that's another good lesson for us as women.

400
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,039
We need to support other women who are going through that sort of thing.

401
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,500
And I've seen that now with some of the more, you know,

402
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,960
when some of the women in Australia have got into a bit of strife,

403
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,619
I've been a bit of a listening ground for them.

404
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,619
When I was living in London, I housed a few people as they came over.

405
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,180
And it's really built my friendships with particularly some other women,

406
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,940
but not just women, but other men.

407
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,119
It's a great story that you share.

408
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,759
I mean, Lindsay Fox is an incredibly well-known Melburnian,

409
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:35,180
created a business that is legendary, a multi-billion dollar business,

410
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:35,680
Lynn Fox.

411
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,339
And, you know, that's an interesting story.

412
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,839
It's not necessarily what people would associate with Lindsay Fox,

413
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,420
picking up the phone.

414
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,220
I love you.

415
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,460
You, in that era, men weren't great at saying that even now,

416
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,079
but to have that, and I suppose I am interested, Roz,

417
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:49,420
in talking about, you're really open about, you know,

418
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,539
you were married to Paul Kelly, the political journalist,

419
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,900
and now the editor of The Australian.

420
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,519
And that was, you know, balancing being a politician yourself

421
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,140
and having a political journalist for a husband.

422
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,359
And it wasn't a partnership and a relationship that worked for you.

423
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,079
And then your marriage to David Morgan,

424
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,980
who people know really well as his incredible success,

425
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:10,940
firstly in the Treasury,

426
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,720
but as the CEO of the Westpac Bank.

427
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,240
You said to me really clearly, this is,

428
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,160
and it probably is the most important decision you can make in your life,

429
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,440
isn't it?

430
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,740
Your partner and your friendships around you who support you,

431
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,119
but we don't talk about it enough often, Roz.

432
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,619
Why do you think that is?

433
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,619
And how can we be good at that?

434
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,880
So every single women's group or group I've ever talked to,

435
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,059
I say the first, the most important decision you make in your career

436
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,900
is who is your partner?

437
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,740
Or you either have a partner,

438
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,119
or you don't have a partner.

439
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,720
That's another decision.

440
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,019
But then who's the support group around you?

441
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,000
Everybody needs a support group around me.

442
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,200
Now, I have to say one of my,

443
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:59,200
one of the things I've been able to do since I left public life

444
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
is be a bit of support to my niece,

445
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,500
who's the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp.

446
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,720
And I remember Sally came to me some time ago

447
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,599
when,

448
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,440
you had this other very wayward Lord Mayor,

449
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,160
to put it mildly.

450
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,680
And she said,

451
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,099
do you think I should have a go at this?

452
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,940
I said, so, of course.

453
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,180
Everything prepares you for this.

454
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,599
And it's been lovely for me

455
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,799
to be able to be a bit of a support to her

456
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,839
because she knew nothing about politics,

457
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,359
like very naive about it.

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,079
And Andrew, her darling husband,

459
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,839
is so naive about it.

460
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,640
And so I've had to be there at the end of the phone

461
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,900
to give support,

462
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,279
to him in particular,

463
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,859
to say, look, it's only politics.

464
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,859
Because, you know,

465
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
so that it doesn't always have to be your partner,

466
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,039
but you have to have a network around you

467
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,880
to keep you balanced and supported.

468
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,480
And those decisions you make on who those people are

469
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,799
and who you can trust are fundamental,

470
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,619
fundamental to how well you're going to be able

471
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,420
to go in your job.

472
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,579
There's one other thing I want to talk about too,

473
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,720
that again, doesn't get much of a mention,

474
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,299
and that's looking after yourself.

475
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,460
Women are notoriously bad at this.

476
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,160
And I was true.

477
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:25,859
The worst example of this was I had my baby in 1983,

478
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,180
my first child born in the house of preps,

479
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,920
there was lots of controversy about whether you go back

480
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,500
to work or not.

481
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,480
Well, I feel I had to go back to work

482
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,660
because we had no maternity leave.

483
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,680
There was no facilities, nothing.

484
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,400
And I was the first one,

485
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,700
I was the first to go.

486
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:43,960
So when you're the first, you're always conscious

487
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,299
that you've got to do it, be perfect,

488
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,500
or you've got to try and be perfect.

489
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,619
You never are, but anyway.

490
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,259
So I went back to work and I said, you know,

491
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,619
despite all the criticism, look, I've got to do it my way.

492
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,640
You know, I had David supporting me.

493
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,200
I had my mother.

494
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,299
So I went back and did this job.

495
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,619
But I went back after five days.

496
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,460
And then, to make it worse, I kept working right through.

497
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
So I went back in August.

498
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,119
The following November, I had another child.

499
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,900
So I'd worked all the way through before Ben was born in November,

500
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,859
the night before I said I was at a ball.

501
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,059
And I said to the Prime Minister, oh, I've got to go.

502
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm having a baby tomorrow.

503
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,900
I did that on the 4th of November.

504
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,039
I know that the 11th of November I was laying the reef

505
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,299
at the war memorial.

506
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:35,480
And I know I was at the opening of the election campaign.

507
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,259
And then I did an election campaign.

508
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,740
So all of that.

509
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,740
Then on Christmas Day, I was at home and the Keatings were coming

510
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,920
around for Christmas lunch.

511
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,819
And all of a sudden, I just started vomiting.

512
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,819
My body just said, enough is enough.

513
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
Now, that was nuts to do all that.

514
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,460
And I keep advising women, and I've seen my own daughter

515
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,359
and daughter-in-law have babies now.

516
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,400
And I say, how did I do it?

517
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,759
Why did I do it?

518
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,720
I do not know.

519
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,799
But because you're the sort of pioneer, you think you're indispensable,

520
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,140
you're not.

521
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,500
And that's all nonsense.

522
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,740
It's all nonsense.

523
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,299
So you've got to look after your body.

524
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,019
And I think it was only then after I got breast cancer later on

525
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,759
that I said, there are lessons in all this.

526
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,640
And I just think everyone, men and women, but particularly women,

527
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,119
because they put everyone else first, have to look after yourself.

528
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:38,480
You did mention Paul and Anita Keating were your dinner guests

529
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
for Christmas that day when you were sick.

530
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,000
And you had friendships and relationships and partnerships

531
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,539
with them.

532
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,819
Iconic leaders in Australian history and iconic prime ministers

533
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,319
like Paul Keating and Bob Hawke.

534
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,279
Can I ask you, maybe start with Paul Keating.

535
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,859
It was a great friendship of yours and with your husband,

536
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:56,920
David Morgan, as well.

537
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,240
What type of leader was Paul Keating?

538
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,380
Paul led from the front, always.

539
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,579
And he believed when he reached a conclusion, he'd listen.

540
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,380
He'd always listen to your views.

541
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,980
Then he'd reach his views, and he just went for it.

542
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,579
And that...

543
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,900
You know, at that time, it was so important because we were bringing

544
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
about major changes.

545
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,440
And I remember a few times in the Cabinet Room, he'd come in,

546
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,619
we'd call the Cabinet meeting, and he'd say, okay, we're about,

547
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,960
here's a paper, we're privatising the Commonwealth Bank to die.

548
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:32,880
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

549
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,319
And some of the others would go, what?

550
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,359
We're not doing this.

551
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,740
And he'll say, well, if you want me to be Treasurer, you are.

552
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,259
He always knew he had Bob on side, of course.

553
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:45,980
Because they worked very well together.

554
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,440
So, no, he led from the front.

555
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,200
But Bob was...

556
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,299
Bob had this great skill, and that's why I think they were brilliant together.

557
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,480
Bob was able to bring the community with him.

558
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,440
And that's, I think, what we need today, too.

559
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,420
More of a conversation about issues.

560
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,839
Leadership from the front, but bringing the community with you.

561
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:11,799
And, you know, Richo always used to say, you know, the mob usually get it right.

562
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,839
And they do.

563
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,059
As we saw in the last election.

564
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,180
But, you know, people aren't stupid.

565
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,180
You know, when reforms need to be done, you need a conversation with the electorate

566
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,240
and get them to understand what's happening.

567
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,519
And that's the style of leadership they were.

568
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,880
It was, I was so privileged to be part of all that.

569
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,920
So privileged.

570
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,880
You mentioned Senator Richo, Senator Graeme Richardson,

571
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,680
who was a legendary numbers man, I suppose, in the Labor cabinets that you were involved in.

572
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,119
And I'm fascinated, Paul Keating, you write about him as a man of obsessions,

573
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,339
whether it was budgerigar breeding or French China or clocks or economic reform.

574
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,119
If he had something, no matter what it was, he was obsessed with getting it through.

575
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,099
I want to ask you about Bob Hawke.

576
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,200
And you had, obviously, clearly an incredibly close relationship with him.

577
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,359
They talk about the charisma of Bob Hawke.

578
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:12,359
You write a great story in your book about you driving along in your Mazda 121 to a shopping centre in Canberra.

579
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,500
How about I tell that story?

580
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,319
Because I was a new candidate for office and so was Bob.

581
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,119
So we were elected at the same time.

582
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,519
And so I thought, oh, I'll use Bob in my election campaign.

583
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:29,259
So little did I know, one of the reasons he really loved being in Canberra

584
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,980
was because he was having an affair with Blanche Delpuget,

585
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,579
who was also one of my constituents.

586
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,200
But I didn't know that at the time.

587
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,160
Anyway, so we were driving along Highmarch Drive in Canberra

588
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,559
and we pulled up at the lights.

589
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,640
It's near the hospital there.

590
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,500
And I had my little yellow Mazda with signs,

591
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,940
Ros Kelly Cares for Canberra.

592
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,900
And there was a little beetle next door with the roof down.

593
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,960
And Bob looked across and there were these two gorgeous looking women there.

594
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,599
And they saw Bob and they said, oh, hi, Bob.

595
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,180
Hi, Bob.

596
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,099
And Bob saw them, responded.

597
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,140
They stopped at the lights.

598
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,519
Bob got out and got into their car and disappeared for two hours.

599
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,779
When he turned up, I was in the pharmacy, one of the pharmacies in my constituency.

600
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,279
And he just wanders in, starts chatting to the pharmacist

601
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,539
and gets sort of the best shampoo for his hair.

602
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,759
That was Bob.

603
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,180
That was Bob.

604
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,720
And the Australian public loved him, Ros.

605
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,220
Loved him.

606
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:34,160
They were enamoured with him, weren't they, right across his political life for a moment.

607
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,099
But I must say he was a very generous, spirited person.

608
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,299
So, you know, towards the end when the leadership stuff was,

609
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,299
oh, it was so terrifying.

610
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,759
It was terrible for me having to vote for, well, vote for Bob against Bill Hayden

611
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,440
and then secondly to vote for Paul against Bob.

612
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,400
That was like, those moments are harrowing in politics, harrowing,

613
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,660
because your gut's hurt, you know.

614
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,259
And you know the time has come, but you don't want them to go.

615
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,779
But, you know, for the gut, you've got to do the right thing

616
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,579
for what you believe in for the country.

617
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,339
Anyway, during those leadership things,

618
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,720
I voted for Paul because he was just like my brother.

619
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,819
And actually, Bob was great.

620
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,420
He never actually asked me for the vote because he knew that my vote went to Paul.

621
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,380
Anyway, afterwards, after we'd both left public life, I went to see him.

622
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,680
And I said to him, Bob, look, you know I always appreciated your leadership

623
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,359
and I love being part of your leadership team and I hated the way it ended

624
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,220
and I'm sorry that I couldn't vote for you.

625
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,339
And he looked at me and he said, look, Ros,

626
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:47,380
he said, they did, the Labor Party did me a favour.

627
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,579
He said, it made me, gave me the opportunity to marry Blanche

628
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,099
and she's been the love of my life.

629
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,400
Now, what a generous spirit, what a generous spirit.

630
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:01,799
And, you know, in politics, you need a generous spirit.

631
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,779
Like, you can't just wish that things have been different or when you left politics,

632
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:12,259
when I left politics, even though, you know, I was, I was battered and bruised.

633
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:16,339
I stopped for a while and this is why all of us have got to do the same.

634
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,440
Life doesn't work out always the way we want it to.

635
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,039
We've got to sit back, relish, indulge with the people we love,

636
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,000
and then look for the next opportunity.

637
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,779
And that's, again, what leadership is.

638
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,140
You know, you've got to know yourself, be good to yourself,

639
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,059
rely on your friends, and then look for the next opportunity, the door that opens.

640
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:42,059
There are incredibly wise words, Ros.

641
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:46,779
As someone who's lived your life experience, and I'm really looking forward to doing this

642
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:51,599
because in the work we're doing, we're seeing these consistent dimensions

643
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,799
of what great leadership looks like and to have your thoughts on it.

644
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,640
And you've gone to some of those places already, but please be as expansive as you like, Ros,

645
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,539
on these different dimensions of leadership.

646
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:05,579
But we start with self-leadership, and it's where you were going all the way along, I think,

647
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:09,380
which was, you know, you need to have that sense of self before you can lead others.

648
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,059
Is that what it means to you that you need to identify?

649
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,059
Identify that in terms of self-leadership?

650
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,059
Yes.

651
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,519
You need to, well, you need to know who you are.

652
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,660
You need to know what your strengths and what your weaknesses are.

653
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,660
And with the weaknesses, you can develop them.

654
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,099
You can work on them.

655
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,099
But you need, when you're with a team, you need to have people, for example, I was running

656
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:33,740
the Breast Cancer Foundation.

657
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,019
I am a really good marketer.

658
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,640
What I'm hopeless at is the absolute detail of things.

659
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,039
So I surround myself with detailed people.

660
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,299
Like, why was I successful in an environmental company?

661
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:51,660
I was full of engineers, full of engineers who are great on detail, but not particularly

662
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:58,660
good at marketing or, you know, knowing how to synthesize issues.

663
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,420
So you need to know what your strengths and weaknesses are.

664
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,039
And I think that's fundamental to leadership.

665
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,160
And you need to listen to people around you.

666
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,259
You don't need to necessarily change your opinion on things, but you need to listen.

667
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:11,859
And you need to listen.

668
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:17,059
And then you go for it and you sell it and you believe in it.

669
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,599
I think one hard thing for women, and I'm sure, I'm not sure I've got the right balance

670
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,319
on this now, you've got to be true to yourself.

671
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,619
So then how much have you got to play the game?

672
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:38,099
When you're in really hostile environments, you've got to be really conscious of everything

673
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,099
about you.

674
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,099
Like after I left public life, I worked in the mining industry.

675
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:50,539
Now, when I went on a mining site, I made sure I always wore all the appropriate safety

676
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:51,539
gear.

677
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,599
I looked like everybody else.

678
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:59,859
When I went down mines, I behaved like everyone else.

679
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,039
I'd go and chat to people in a way.

680
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,720
So I was still myself, but I'd always know I'd have to dress the way everyone else dressed

681
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,980
because, well, they were the rules of the game.

682
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Yeah.

683
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,039
You've got to play those to a degree.

684
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:21,539
And when I was recently, I was a War Graves commissioner and total British environment.

685
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,539
I was the only woman for a while.

686
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,420
I was the only non-Brit.

687
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,179
So they expect Australians to behave in a certain way.

688
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:39,019
I wasn't as forthright as I normally am, because if I said everything I thought, it would have

689
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,980
been very hard to get anything done.

690
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,079
So you've got to be smarter than everyone else.

691
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,420
You've got to work your way, work out how to be yourself without changing yourself,

692
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,980
but know the culture you're working in.

693
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,820
There's some brilliant subtlety in that answer, Ros.

694
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,420
And I love picking it up from different leaders in different ways.

695
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,440
You're having an interesting conversation a couple of days ago on this forum.

696
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,980
Ange Postacoglou has become a legendary coach of Australian soccer and have just won the

697
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,980
title at Celtic.

698
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
And he describes that.

699
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,019
You know, he's coaching in Japan or coaching in Australia.

700
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,019
He's been in Australia for a long time.

701
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:10,940
He's been in Australia for a long time.

702
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,460
And Scotland, you know, he's got to be a chameleon.

703
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,139
He still knows exactly who he is, knows exactly his sense of self.

704
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:21,059
But you know, you're foolish if you don't think you have to, you know, bend to the environment

705
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:23,980
you win to be able to influence in a positive way.

706
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,000
So it's fascinating to hear you in your world in a very similar light.

707
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,760
We see leaders, Ros, are really conscious around, you know, good leaders in a modern

708
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,420
sense around how they positively impact others in the environment they work in.

709
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,900
How did you go about that?

710
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,039
Does that resonate with you, positively impacting others?

711
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:40,920
Yeah.

712
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,300
I think sometimes we don't realise the influence we have.

713
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:55,019
I find that now I often, you know, that program Misrepresented that was on, I think that was

714
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,659
one of the first times I realised that there's a whole generation of young women out there

715
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:06,099
who appreciate what you went through, appreciate the sort of leadership you had.

716
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,579
And often now I'll be going to a shop or I'll say, oh, you're Ros Kelly.

717
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,519
Oh, thanks for what you've done for us.

718
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:24,920
And because I think I was uninterested in survival that, you know, I wasn't really conscious.

719
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,199
People generally aren't that good at coming forward, but it's amazing how many, since

720
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,820
that, as you get older, they come forward and say, oh yeah, you did have an influence

721
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
on me.

722
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,440
But I think you can do that wherever you are.

723
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,440
You have a huge influence as a school teacher.

724
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:55,659
I remember I was at a function in London, in Australia House in London, and the ABC

725
00:36:55,659 --> 00:37:00,199
journalist covering it came over to me and said, oh, you taught me at Dixon High School

726
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,099
or Narrabundah High School, and you had a huge influence on me.

727
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:07,940
And I thought, oh, oh, wow, am I that old?

728
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
But, but, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

729
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.

730
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,119
You know, I just think you've just got to be true to yourself and you don't go into

731
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,900
these things to influence other people, but it is amazing how you do.

732
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,320
And you've got to be conscious of all that.

733
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:28,260
I think that's what too, social media has brought in new rules of the game.

734
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,599
You're always, you're always on.

735
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,599
You're always on.

736
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,940
Keating used to say, oh, when I get into parliament, I switch to Vaudable.

737
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,940
Well, in a way, when we're all...

738
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Yeah.

739
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,900
We're always out there because anyone can take a film of us.

740
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,440
We've got, as leaders, we have to be conscious of that, have to be conscious.

741
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,820
And would people like, would you like, would your children like to see you in that context?

742
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,780
So many places to go on your, on your answer there, Ros.

743
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,500
My mind's going to Paul Keating on the floor of parliament and what the incredible orator

744
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
that he was.

745
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,820
And he certainly, as you said, flicked the switch to Vaudable at times, but did it in

746
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
a way that very few people...

747
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Yeah.

748
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,820
...have, in terms of leaders creating and sharing their vision and really conscious

749
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,760
about it, your life has had many parts.

750
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,860
I love that you started as a school teacher.

751
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,059
You were part of the old Commonwealth Scholarship Fund where your uni fees and allowances were

752
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:26,579
paid, but there was a five-year term.

753
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,579
You had to be a teacher.

754
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:31,340
It was a brilliant program when you think back, you know, it captured people like you

755
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
who were passed on.

756
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Yes.

757
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,780
And we, you know, generally think teachers are under-celebrated for the influence that

758
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
they have.

759
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
And it's great.

760
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,179
It's great to see how you influence someone's life and they come back many years later to

761
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:45,199
show you, getting back to creating and sharing the vision of your life, were you conscious

762
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,199
about that?

763
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,880
And how did you go about creating and sharing the vision for the work that you did?

764
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,980
I think I didn't do anything about, I think in, when I was in federal parliament and everything,

765
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,719
I was into survival.

766
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:04,780
I think, and I think also maybe I feel like when I was in parliament, I didn't do enough

767
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
to support other women because I was just into survival.

768
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Yeah.

769
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,320
I was into surviving myself.

770
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,659
It was only really after I went to London, David, I was running the Breast Cancer Foundation

771
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:23,599
and David got the opportunity to run a private equity firm after he'd given up Westpac.

772
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,739
So we moved to London because I'd never lived overseas.

773
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:32,679
And there I got this, the governor general was the Quentin Bryce and she was coming through

774
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,199
London and the high commission had asked me to put together a group of women for her to

775
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,079
talk to because at that stage I'd got involved with a group called Women on Boards.

776
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,960
So I invited, we invited, you know, 50 or 60 women and we had a conversation about what

777
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,880
are the lessons we've learnt from things.

778
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,239
And so I interviewed Quentin and at the end of that, she said to me, why don't you keep

779
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,500
doing this?

780
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,940
So I did.

781
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,340
And so for the next seven years, when I was in London, I interviewed numbers of women

782
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,199
who were Australian women coming through.

783
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,519
And some British women who were friends of Australia, we had a big audience.

784
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:16,800
And what we do is we talk about the lessons we've learnt and how they can help other women.

785
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,420
And we're doing a similar thing now I get, I'm involved at ANU doing this as well.

786
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,699
So there, you know, the things where I can get other women to talk about themselves.

787
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:36,079
I interviewed Julia, Julia at one stage in London and you, you know, after she'd left,

788
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:45,260
after being prime minister, I said to her, for example, with the speech, the dramatic

789
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,340
speech she gave on misogyny, I said, do you think you made the call, left it too long

790
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,159
to make the call?

791
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,380
And she said, probably.

792
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,440
And then we were able to talk about women being in that context in a workforce.

793
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,380
When do you speak out?

794
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,400
How do you speak out?

795
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
You know?

796
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,480
So there are lessons that that's what I want to do now.

797
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,159
I share the experiences, good and bad, a lot of my mistakes, but you want to share them

798
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:18,280
and talk frankly about them to help other women.

799
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,199
That's brilliant, Ros, and a great contribution along with all the other contribution of your

800
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,199
life.

801
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:27,239
I mean, can I ask you with all that, that knowledge, and it's a hard thing, we're always

802
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,980
looking for soundbites in life, aren't we?

803
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,900
But for young women listening who've got ambition and want to pursue leadership, I mean, what's

804
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,400
your advice?

805
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,099
What's your advice to someone, or start a business, or create their own path?

806
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,159
What's your advice to young women generally?

807
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,300
Have a go.

808
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Have a go.

809
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,099
What's the worst thing that happens?

810
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,599
You fail, and you learn by it.

811
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,880
It's really interesting in our society where you never ... In Australia, we're never allowed

812
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,940
to fail.

813
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,219
But if you're in the United States, a failure's almost a badge of honor.

814
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,480
You just jump onto the next thing, they call it pivoting.

815
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,019
But you go onto the next thing, and we think, don't be scared of failure.

816
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:18,760
Just have a go, and think about it, plan, learn as much as you can, listen to the experts,

817
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,400
and make the call yourself, have a group of supportive people around you, and have people

818
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,980
who believe in you, but have a go and believe in yourself.

819
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,719
Yeah, brilliantly said.

820
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,380
We see leaders have curiosity as a common part of their nature, and they are curious

821
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,760
and through that curiosity, Ros, they're really open to how they learn and improve themselves.

822
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,139
Does curiosity ring a bell with you?

823
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,880
Yeah, but it's interest.

824
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,940
I suppose you could call it curiosity.

825
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,039
I'd call it more enthusiasm for life.

826
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,539
So just this morning before I talk to you, I've been talking to a friend of mine who's

827
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:03,920
starting a new business in the environmental field, and it's so exciting, and I'm now really

828
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,099
enthused about it, because I'm curious.

829
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,119
I want to follow through some of the climate change stuff that I started many years ago.

830
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,099
And so I'm curious, but I'm enthusiastic for life.

831
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,920
So I think you could almost call it that.

832
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,579
Yeah, and that's a great way to think about it, yeah, that enthusiasm.

833
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:30,539
Through that lens, it certainly resonates with me.

834
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:33,300
Communicating with clarity, Ros, we see is a common trait.

835
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:33,900
Yeah.

836
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,780
Of great leaders in recent times, I mean, it's a great skill of yours.

837
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,400
You can hear it in the clarity of the way you're speaking to me today, but also when

838
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,800
you were in politics.

839
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,920
Did you give that thought?

840
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,420
Did you work on your craft of communication?

841
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,940
Well, I'm a schoolie.

842
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,099
You see, I'm trained.

843
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:58,440
Every school teacher is trained in how to communicate.

844
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,300
And you've just got to remember our audience is really school kids.

845
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:11,099
And I always say to people, when you are absolutely bored out of your mind with an

846
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:17,380
issue, you know the electorate is, the people you're trying to talk to are just coming to

847
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,320
terms with it.

848
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:26,300
And I think people forget that the most important thing is your own conviction when you speak,

849
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,139
the passion that you have for it.

850
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:31,980
You've obviously got to know the logic.

851
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,079
And it's got to be based on your ethics.

852
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,619
But the most important thing is the pathos, the passion, you know, to sell your story,

853
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:44,019
to convince someone to be with you, to go up that hill.

854
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:49,099
David always said to me, you know, he said, when I was in treasury, everything was about

855
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,099
the ideas.

856
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,260
You'd excel and you'd get everyone around you because of the great ideas.

857
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,139
When he went into Westpac and he had then 40,000 people, he had to convince everyone

858
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:02,880
to go up the hill with him, a totally different style of leadership.

859
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,380
So I think you've always got to look at what is the task ahead.

860
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:14,000
But communicating clearly and bringing people with you and listening to people and making

861
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,420
them a partner in the outcome, I think is really important.

862
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,519
And Ros, collaboration is the final dimension we're talking about, that people in leadership

863
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,440
now are really conscious of how important collaboration is.

864
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,639
Is that been part of your leadership style?

865
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:30,880
Has to be.

866
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Because it goes back to the point.

867
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,699
The point I made, you've got to know what you're good at and what you are not good at.

868
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:42,920
And so you need to build a collaborative team around you.

869
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:50,559
And I do think there's much more of a realisation of that and that women's style of leadership

870
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,000
is collaborative.

871
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,820
It isn't conflict.

872
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:00,599
One thing I think people hate is women fighting other women or making it personal.

873
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,800
So, you know, just bringing people with you.

874
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,159
Recognising sometimes that there are some people who won't work with you, there's some

875
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,159
that won't work with you.

876
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,599
Well, they should just go.

877
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:17,239
And if you're in a culture where you have a leader and it's not someone you have the

878
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,039
same ethical values of or someone you believe in, you shouldn't be there.

879
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:26,679
You shouldn't, you should go and try something new and you'll feel a lot happier in yourself

880
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:27,679
as well.

881
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,619
Yeah, that's, you know, sage advice there, Ros, isn't it?

882
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:32,619
You know.

883
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:38,059
And I've got to go back and work out who said it, you know, the great partnerships.

884
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,900
You need shared values first and foremost.

885
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,380
Without that, you're no chance.

886
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,760
You need complementary capabilities so you can complement each other and shared vision.

887
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,719
So if you take the values part out, in your view, Ros, you're not aligned on values, you

888
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,719
go and you have to change.

889
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,719
You go.

890
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,699
Well, it's the same as a marriage, a partnership, isn't it?

891
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:00,380
Any sort of partnership, whether it's your marriage, whether it's your friendships, whether

892
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,179
it's your work environment.

893
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:06,019
If you haven't got a shared value system, it won't last.

894
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,179
It just won't last.

895
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,920
And so it applies to everything.

896
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,739
And I think companies now have started to realise how critical that is, or maybe not

897
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:17,739
all of them.

898
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:21,099
I think too many of them are still based on how much the bottom line, how much money

899
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:28,860
you make, particularly some of the big, they're not the retail bankers, but, you know, some

900
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,420
of those hard edged American companies.

901
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,699
But I do think more and more of the bigger companies realised that if they're going to

902
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:38,659
manage with a lot of people, it's got to be shared values.

903
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:39,659
Yeah.

904
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:40,659
Brilliantly said.

905
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:44,860
Ros, I've been asking these two questions of all the leaders I've had the privilege of

906
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,179
sitting down with.

907
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:52,800
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

908
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,599
Probably Paul.

909
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,239
Probably Paul Keating.

910
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:57,239
Yeah.

911
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,239
Mark.

912
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,239
Mad.

913
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:00,239
Passionate.

914
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:01,239
But, you know.

915
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,239
But, yeah.

916
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,119
Yeah.

917
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,119
Yeah.

918
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,119
Really brought about change.

919
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,519
And, but it's really hard to separate him from Paul, from Bob because they were, the

920
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,659
style of leadership was, was the essence of who they both were.

921
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:20,440
So one was the communicator, one was the sort of the hard boy.

922
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,260
And the combination of the two of them was pretty amazing.

923
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,880
And to be part of the government then was phenomenal.

924
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,360
Have we lost that in political life, Ros, that combination where they're very different

925
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
personalities, aren't they?

926
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
Paul Keating and Bob Hawke.

927
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,360
You couldn't get polar opposites, but that collaboration, as you said, it worked, didn't

928
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
it?

929
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
They respected each other's strengths.

930
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
It worked.

931
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
It worked until it didn't.

932
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Yeah.

933
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Yeah.

934
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,360
And I think that's a bit of the boy stuff and the testosterone and the conflict.

935
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,360
I think Anthony Albanese is a different style of leader.

936
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,360
I think he is much more of a collaborative leader.

937
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,360
I'm hoping we'll see this in the new government.

938
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,860
The final question, Ros, is in the spirit of collaboration, has there been anyone in

939
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:13,860
all of the many areas of success you've had in political life, in charitable life, in

940
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,800
all of your business world that you've thought, if I could collaborate with that person, and

941
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,360
you've mentioned extraordinary people, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.

942
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,360
I want to ask you actually before I go about Bill Clinton too, because you came across

943
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,360
Bill in your-

944
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
Oh yeah.

945
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,360
I was going to say to you.

946
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,860
Could I ask you about that before I go to the final, because you're a minister for defense.

947
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,860
You come across the legendary Bill Clinton who-

948
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,860
No.

949
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,860
I was minister for the environment and I went to Washington and I was meeting up with the

950
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,860
head of the EPA there, a great woman called Carol Brana.

951
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:49,860
And she said to me, do you want to come to the Earth Day speech by the then president?

952
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,860
And I said, sure.

953
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,860
Sure.

954
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,860
I'd love to.

955
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,860
I'd be honored.

956
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,860
So without any notice, I went along.

957
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,360
I was on the front row and in comes Bill Clinton.

958
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,860
And he comes along the front row to shake hands with us.

959
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,860
And he shakes hands to Carol and Carol introduces to me.

960
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,860
And he grabs my hand and he looks into my eyes and he says, oh, Roz, he said, so wonderful

961
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,860
to have you here.

962
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,860
We're so privileged.

963
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
He gets up to speak.

964
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,860
And before he speaks, this is the president of the United States.

965
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:24,860
He says, well, I'd just like everyone before I speak to welcome Roz Kelly, Australia's

966
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,860
environment minister here.

967
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,860
Australia is so special to us.

968
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,860
And we're so thrilled to have her.

969
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,860
Would everyone, would you stand up, Roz, and everyone can welcome you.

970
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
Well, I was a goner.

971
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,860
Like how good was that?

972
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,360
That was pretty good.

973
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,860
They talk about the legendary charisma that he had and you experienced it first up.

974
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,860
Yeah, I sure did.

975
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,860
My husband always asked me the question, what if?

976
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,860
I said, no, no.

977
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,860
Never happened.

978
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,860
Because you know you'd be a chance.

979
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,860
I think.

980
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,860
You never.

981
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,860
That's.

982
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,860
But that was a great privilege being in part of all that.

983
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,860
And do you know what?

984
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,860
When I was, I think there are some fabulous women leaders.

985
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,860
One I've always been fascinated was, was Indira Gandhi.

986
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:24,860
And just that sort of style of motherly leadership, which you could do in a culture like India.

987
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,860
But wouldn't be appropriate here.

988
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:35,860
But to look at some of those great leaders who in their time just made such an impact.

989
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,860
I mean, that is just a great privilege.

990
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,860
I read quite a lot about the history of some of those women.

991
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,860
Yeah.

992
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,860
I didn't quite get to the final point about, has there been someone through your journey

993
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,860
that you thought I'd love to just collaborate with them on any part of your life?

994
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,860
Is there another name that springs to mind?

995
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,860
Well, I think it is.

996
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,860
I would have.

997
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:01,860
I really, really would love to work on some of those big change, charity change things.

998
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:07,860
Like with, I think I'd really like to work with Hillary Clinton.

999
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:14,860
I've just finished reading her account of not winning.

1000
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:20,860
And oh my God, how different the US would have been if she would have got elected.

1001
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
And to think of what she put up with.

1002
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,780
So do.

1003
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,860
I mean, I just, I would love to have spent more time with her comparing notes.

1004
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,860
And I know her and Julia have done that.

1005
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,860
And they've done a great podcast together, which everyone should listen to.

1006
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,860
So Julia and Hillary Clinton have.

1007
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,860
Yeah.

1008
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,860
Fantastic.

1009
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,860
I've done a podcast.

1010
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,860
Yeah.

1011
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,860
Look that up.

1012
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
That would be, that would be fascinating.

1013
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,860
And you're right, isn't it?

1014
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,860
To think what you paved the way, you know, in the early eighties and late seventies.

1015
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,860
But to see, you know, on the international stage, what Hillary Clinton had to put up

1016
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,860
with.

1017
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,860
What politics she sit on.

1018
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,860
And the language that was, you lock her up, chanted at her.

1019
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,860
Oh, it was terrible.

1020
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,860
And the book I read, you know, I've been, as I said, I've been reading her book about

1021
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,860
what went wrong.

1022
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,860
But what they go through, the sort of campaigns.

1023
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,860
I mean, any human being getting through, going through those, you know, the pre-selection

1024
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,860
processes to start with, you know, even before you even get into the main race.

1025
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,860
Oh, it's inhumane.

1026
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,860
Ros.

1027
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,860
Your book is titled A Passionate Life.

1028
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,860
It's an extraordinary life of leadership and success and openness and, you know, starting

1029
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,860
with very humble beginnings.

1030
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:35,860
You read about where you grew up and to get yourself a scholarship at university and go

1031
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,860
on and paved the way for so many people, especially women in Australia.

1032
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,860
It's a great honor to have been able to sit down with you and I really appreciate it.
