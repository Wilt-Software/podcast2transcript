A Listener Production.

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:52,789
Russell Halfcroft, in many ways, is the public face

12
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,009
of brand marketing and advertising in Australia.

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,450
Russell's 24 years in the advertising industry

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,049
included five years in the UK, co-founding and running his own agency,

15
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:04,989
eventually becoming chairman and CEO of Young & Rubicon Brands Australia

16
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,510
in New Zealand.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,969
Russell's love and passion for advertising has been highlighted

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,230
on the ABC TV's Gruen, one of the most watched shows

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,390
on Australian television every year, co-hosted by Russell and Will Anderson.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,969
Russell's diverse career has included stintings

21
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,489
at Network 10 as executive general manager,

22
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,730
chief creative officer and partner at PricewaterhouseCooper,

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,109
founding partner of Sayers and now co-host alongside radio legend

24
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:32,390
Russ Stevenson on Melbourne's number one breakfast show on 3AW.

25
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:33,569
Russ, it's always great to see you.

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,430
That's the nicest intro I've ever had.

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,549
Thank you.

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,109
I put some thought into it, Russ, because it's a diverse

29
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,989
and creative passion-filled life that you've had

30
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:45,250
and there's been some big leadership roles in amongst it

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,269
and you've managed lots of people.

32
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,670
Russ, there was a quote I heard attributed to you,

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,590
and this may be wrong, please correct me,

34
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,269
that work-life balance is bullshit.

35
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,489
Yeah, I did say that.

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,030
Do you stand by it?

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,810
Yeah, I do.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,430
What do you mean?

39
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,890
I just think that it's one and the same thing.

40
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,209
I don't think they're two separate parts of your life.

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,769
I think that my life is work and work is my life.

42
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,170
I'm very happy.

43
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,669
It's not that I'm a workaholic and I don't want to go home.

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,069
I just don't see it as a line.

45
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,090
I don't see it as I'm going to stop work now,

46
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,090
I'm going to start life now.

47
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,090
I think work and life.

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,430
I think work and life is the same thing.

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,610
Would Kate agree with you?

50
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:26,469
Yeah, well, she's hung out with me a long time.

51
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,610
I think she would understand that, yeah, she would get that,

52
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,050
in that that is me.

53
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,050
You know, I'd be, I just, if I'm not working, what am I doing?

54
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:47,490
You know, I feel that that's where my energy comes from.

55
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,090
Yeah, and I love it.

56
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,969
I love how you explain that because I agree with that too.

57
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,490
I think because you've, I can't imagine you sitting in a space

58
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,469
that you weren't passionate about.

59
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,750
So you're not really, if the term work means something arduous

60
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,629
that you don't want to do.

61
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:58,969
That's right.

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,930
Then it's separate, isn't it?

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,250
But I think, you know, that concept of saying, you know,

64
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,789
there's other dimensions to you, Russ, and other parts of your life.

65
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,090
I'm going to talk about some of them.

66
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,210
If you get that out of whack because you focus solely on your income

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,550
driving part of your life, then that becomes an issue.

68
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,550
Would you agree with that or?

69
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,710
Yeah, okay, so that's good.

70
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:18,289
Yes.

71
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,969
Because I'm not a spreadsheet person.

72
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,270
I'm not looking at my personal spreadsheet.

73
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,330
That's not really what's, that's not what's driving me.

74
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,050
So it's not a focus on that.

75
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,909
It's interesting, isn't it?

76
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,250
Even when I was, you know, the dishwasher, I was very happy, you know,

77
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,789
in the bar doing the dishes and picking up the ashtrays.

78
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,270
I worked in wool stores.

79
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,409
That was pretty full on.

80
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,610
I was the only person that hadn't been to jail working in the wool stores.

81
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,069
I learned a lot there too.

82
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,430
Yeah.

83
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,889
I think that, you know, not to be hung up on this conversation,

84
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,550
I'm fascinated by your outlook on it, Russ,

85
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,590
but I think most of us feel like there's buckets of our life

86
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,569
that you want to give some attention to and clearly, you know,

87
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:02,810
work, however you describe that, is one of those buckets.

88
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,129
Yes.

89
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,349
And, you know, that idea that you're striving to make sure

90
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,330
that the other parts, the family parts, the contribution parts,

91
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:12,729
you know, the time you spend outside of that,

92
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,769
do you give that thought or is it just, you know, you just?

93
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,089
No, I think you're right about this.

94
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:26,069
I do think that it's important to really reflect on priorities.

95
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:28,529
I genuinely do think that that is the case.

96
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,509
And I do try and get some, you know, think hard about priorities.

97
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,250
And I do reflect on stuff that I know I should be better at,

98
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,550
most definitely.

99
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,769
And I reckon over time, over like the last two decades,

100
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,870
I've got marginally better at the stuff I'm not that good at, you know,

101
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,490
but only marginally.

102
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,389
So it's hard, right?

103
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:58,629
But I do, as part of trying to improve, I write a lot down.

104
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,769
So the notion of journaling or the notion of diaries,

105
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,829
the notion of really reflection, I do actually very,

106
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,449
I genuinely believe in that.

107
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,029
And I genuinely believe it's a powerful tool that we should all do.

108
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,689
Yeah.

109
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,490
So what's your habit?

110
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,149
I'm leaning, Russ, and it's, you know, clearly an audio medium,

111
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,509
but that, you know, happens to me just every day,

112
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,509
where you're constantly taking stuff down.

113
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,470
I'm flicking pages of highlight and scribble.

114
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:23,050
That's right.

115
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,410
Is that you?

116
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,790
Is that how you go about it?

117
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,350
If there's an idea or something that catches your mind,

118
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,870
you carry a notebook and.

119
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:30,629
Yeah.

120
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm a little, yes is the answer.

121
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,569
Broadly speaking, yes.

122
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,230
I mean, I have a bit of a system that I've used for a very long time.

123
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,629
I actually put it to bed for a couple of years,

124
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,689
but it's found its way back into my life, which I'm thankful for.

125
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,670
Can I delve a bit deeper?

126
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,709
Were you prepared to share the system?

127
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,470
What do you do from that perspective?

128
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:47,629
Yeah.

129
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,430
Well, I.

130
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,870
So I just have a, I have a diary, a specific diary,

131
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,050
which is a page per day.

132
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,009
And so on that page there, I then divide it into half.

133
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,910
I make sure that I write down what I'm doing every single day.

134
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,290
So yes, I have it in a digital context,

135
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,829
but I also make sure I write it down.

136
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,250
I just, just the pure act of writing it down.

137
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,230
I think really for me,

138
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:17,509
it ensures that I really appreciate it and have a really strong

139
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,069
outlook.

140
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,889
You know, I want to know what's coming.

141
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,670
And I think the digital world doesn't allow that enough.

142
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,509
Um, and then I, on the right hand side,

143
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,170
that will be all the things that need to be done on the weekends.

144
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,050
I just write the, the weekends.

145
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,389
It's not the page isn't divided into two on the weekends.

146
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,889
I'm just writing about what's happening, what's going on,

147
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,449
what I want to do, what should have happened.

148
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,870
Um, reflections, um, which I find to be a,

149
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,410
a really strong thing to do for me.

150
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,569
Um, because it does allow that time just to sit,

151
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,310
maybe relax into it a bit.

152
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,790
Cause if I'm not relaxing into it, well,

153
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,310
then I'll just keep going a little bit, you know, without thinking.

154
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,089
And you said it disappeared for a couple of years,

155
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:02,990
but you started again.

156
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:03,769
What happened?

157
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,949
I, I think it was, um,

158
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,009
probably starting the radio it because as you know,

159
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,810
Luke, it becomes, it, it's a very tiring enterprise.

160
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,230
For those listening, Russell was, uh,

161
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,230
I mentioned in the intro, uh,

162
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,389
um, the, the half alongside, uh, Ross Stevenson on 3AW Breakfast,

163
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,050
which is the extraordinary success story of radio in Australia really,

164
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,990
and dominate the, the ratings and, uh, very much sought after, uh, spot Russ.

165
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,050
And you're how long into that?

166
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,990
That's, um, it's probably 20 months, 20 months.

167
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,490
Yeah.

168
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,209
And change of gear for you.

169
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,069
It is, it is.

170
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,329
And so that, that becomes, it's, uh, you know, it's tiring, it's tiring.

171
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,829
And even if you're like me, it's still tiring, you know?

172
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,829
So.

173
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:53,410
I've had to sort of really work on how do I, how do I actually make my day work?

174
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,709
Um, and you know, making your day work when you get up at, you know, a bit after four

175
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,009
and go to bed a bit after eight, that's a very different life.

176
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,910
And so I've had to sort of rewire.

177
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,009
Um, and I think that's probably the right words as well.

178
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,990
Like you've got to hardwire yourself, don't you?

179
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,550
Yes.

180
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,490
It's a hardwiring exercise.

181
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:12,689
I think I'm there now.

182
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,009
So that's good.

183
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,790
And so maybe I'm sort of getting back into my old rhythms.

184
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,750
I think I saw you about.

185
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,810
Eight weeks in and you look like you've been run over by a bus, Russ.

186
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,790
And it is a, it is just a huge discipline, isn't it?

187
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,610
To, to get that right.

188
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,370
But you've got your spark, uh, back, which I'm, I'm not surprised, but you're right.

189
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,070
The discipline, um, having done it for 11 years, it's, uh, the discipline counts, doesn't it?

190
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,690
I want to switch to one of your great loves, uh, Russ, the Melbourne football club.

191
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:43,570
And in recent times, the extraordinary success that, uh, 57 years of premiership drought

192
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,110
that was ended, uh, last year, beating the team that I love.

193
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,669
Yes.

194
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,149
Bulldogs.

195
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,129
Um, in fact, I might jump into, there's a great leadership story there that I, and I,

196
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,470
I promise you, I'd ask you about this.

197
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,610
Max Gorn is the captain of the club that you love, the Melbourne football club.

198
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,889
I look at him as an outstanding leadership story.

199
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,610
You know him well, Russ.

200
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:02,809
How, how would you describe him?

201
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:09,990
Um, incredibly, he's very, he's a gentleman, he's a gentle person.

202
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,029
And yet he is fierce about ensuring that he gets the best out of himself and the best

203
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,570
out of the club.

204
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,090
It's a really wonderful, I, I really, I'm at, at, at a really banal level.

205
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,009
I love people that are soft on the outside and as hard as on the, on the inside, right?

206
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,210
I think that they have great appeal to me and that's definitely Max, right?

207
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,169
There's a soft element to him, which is very appealing and endearing, but geez, he's hard,

208
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,450
right?

209
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,970
And so, you know, he's had two knee reconstructions for goodness sake, right?

210
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,710
And, and took a while to get going.

211
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,450
And then as soon as it clicked down at, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

212
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,710
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

213
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,529
you know, it clicked and away he went.

214
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,450
It, and he works hard on himself.

215
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,750
He is a very good leader.

216
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,809
Um, there isn't anyone on that list that wouldn't feel that Max is connected to them.

217
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:01,649
So what is there?

218
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,750
42 on a list and the, and the lists turn over pretty significantly, you know, so he's been

219
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,049
there for more than 10 years.

220
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,669
He's probably, I don't know.

221
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,230
He's probably had 160 different players, you know, maybe not as many as that.

222
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,009
certainly 100 over that period.

223
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,149
He'd know all of them.

224
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,190
He'd know all of them well,

225
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,370
and he'd make sure that he's touching everyone, so to speak.

226
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,889
He'd know their partners.

227
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,110
He probably knows the name of the pet, right?

228
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,149
He is that sort of person, which is a great skill in life, isn't it,

229
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:37,210
to really have genuine interest in individuals beyond their, you know,

230
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,830
just the capacity to perform on the footy field.

231
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,809
He's got great empathy with people.

232
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,110
I always knew he was going to be a great leader.

233
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,169
I could see that right from the beginning.

234
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,809
Don McLarty and I were big fans and others on the board.

235
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,350
Of course, Jim.

236
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,190
Jim was onto him straight away.

237
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,490
We were really happy when he arrived at the football club.

238
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,649
And the joints thrived, you know.

239
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,169
I always knew he was – it's easy to say, but I did.

240
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,649
I always knew he was going to be the captain,

241
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,090
and I always knew he was going to hold up that Premiership Cup.

242
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,590
I was convinced of it.

243
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,570
And in fairness, Russ,

244
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,490
you have said that publicly and privately for a long period of time.

245
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,389
And I love that you saw that in him because, you know, he's quirky, Max.

246
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,049
He's such a great guy to be around.

247
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,570
But the era I played in, I don't think Max would have survived quite

248
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,309
or thrived as much because, you know,

249
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,750
his quirkiness wouldn't have been as celebrated at the start.

250
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,169
I remember when he did his second knee injury, and I thought,

251
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,710
that's a shame, you know.

252
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,950
He won't ever get to how wrong was I because,

253
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,029
to do what he does now, and as you said,

254
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,669
and do it with a smile on his face.

255
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,970
He's not the old school Ruckman where, you know,

256
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,950
you have to try all the bluff and bravado.

257
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,750
He's tough as anyone that's played, as you said.

258
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,470
But I think, as you said, that care and connection,

259
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,629
which is, again, part of what we're seeing.

260
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,289
Great leaders now have got that in spades.

261
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,029
You're making me think of a game, I reckon, five or six years ago.

262
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,250
So Max is still on his way, but you could tell that, you know,

263
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,190
things are going well.

264
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,789
He was clearly an important player.

265
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:12,830
He was an important player.

266
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:12,929
He was an important player.

267
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:14,629
We're playing North Melbourne.

268
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,850
Goldstein's going really well.

269
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,549
So what they've done is they've worked out that what Max does,

270
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:24,029
he starts on one wing on the 50 arc, and he's going to run,

271
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,870
basically he's running along the wing as the ball's going to be kicked out.

272
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,909
This is just, you know, some method that they've created.

273
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,289
And he has targeted the entire, you know,

274
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,710
the entire 50-meter arc, smashed, every single time.

275
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,830
But at no point did he do anything other than just keep going

276
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,789
and keep going and keep going and keep going.

277
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,389
And I watched it closely throughout the game,

278
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,230
and it just made me love him even more, right?

279
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,590
It's like, I'm just going to keep going.

280
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:53,690
Yeah, it's good.

281
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,490
It's an inner determination, Russ, isn't it?

282
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,669
You mentioned Jim Stines, and for those that don't follow Australian

283
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,830
rules football, another extraordinary figure,

284
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:01,970
another close friend of yours.

285
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,730
I had the great pleasure and privilege of playing against Jimmy Lott,

286
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,850
spending a lot of time.

287
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,330
Was he hard to keep up with?

288
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,730
Oh, yeah.

289
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:09,690
He was scary.

290
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:09,909
He was a real idiot.

291
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,409
What he did was, you know,

292
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,870
to bring that running capacity into that role when no one had ever been

293
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,549
out of cover of the ground.

294
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,529
He was running better than the midfielders were running,

295
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,669
winning all the mid, and you'd stand in them,

296
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,070
and you'd think, geez, he's not that big, the Irishman.

297
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,789
Surely we'll be able to, you know, get on top of him.

298
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,370
But what you underestimated, which everyone knew in the end,

299
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,490
was this talk about resilience and toughness as well in Jimmy's

300
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,549
inimitable fashion.

301
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,929
It's a great history for your club to have Jimmy hand the jumper to Max

302
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:38,570
and to see that.

303
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,549
That must have been, on your list of great days,

304
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,350
I'm tipping.

305
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,289
That was up there, wasn't it?

306
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,850
And you know what?

307
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,789
I watched it on the couch with Kate, and that was it.

308
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,289
And in a way, you think, oh, that's sad.

309
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,129
But no, it wasn't sad at all.

310
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:58,070
I was thoroughly happy being there on a couch with my wife,

311
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:58,950
and that's it, you know.

312
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,690
We would have liked to have been at the MCG, of course,

313
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,409
but we weren't, and we couldn't be.

314
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:07,409
And it was just a stunning day and a stunning evening, I should say.

315
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,970
We had a fellow that used to, a footballer that used to live with us,

316
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,129
and, you know.

317
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:15,230
And he was, just started on the list, so this was 10 years ago.

318
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:20,470
And he sent us a text at halftime, don't worry, don't worry.

319
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,230
Their fitness will come to the floor.

320
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,269
And then about 10 minutes into the third quarter,

321
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,669
he sent a text saying, have you noticed that Patraca

322
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,389
isn't even puffing yet?

323
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,210
You know, and so I took strength from that.

324
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,710
Yeah, I was calling the game on Triple M,

325
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,690
and Jason Dunstall were working with, said,

326
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,529
about that halfway mark of the third quarter, said,

327
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:42,350
Melbourne can't win.

328
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,049
And I wanted to kill him.

329
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,950
Because you just don't say that, Russ.

330
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,250
And I could still sense that there was plenty of Melbourne.

331
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,509
Well, the Bond, when the Bond kicked 19 points ahead,

332
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,429
and he was on his way, obviously, to just dominate.

333
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,129
He's such a stunning player.

334
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,070
And how good is he as a leader?

335
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,330
He's unbelievable.

336
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:01,570
He's easy to love.

337
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,649
Not just being a Footscray supporter, he's very easy to love.

338
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,509
So, yeah, we got into, yeah, we started to panic.

339
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,789
What type of leader do you see yourself as, Russ?

340
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,070
I like people to shine.

341
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,509
I like people to feel that they've got the opportunity

342
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,409
to genuinely be their best.

343
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,769
I like, you know, it's cool now to say I like diversity,

344
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,629
but I've always liked diversity.

345
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,289
You know, I've always sought out people that were agitators,

346
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,289
people that were different,

347
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,009
people that had a really interesting perspective,

348
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,149
creative people.

349
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,370
I've always had a great affinity with, you know, creative people.

350
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,049
I'm reasonably creative myself, but nowhere near, like,

351
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,409
the serious X factor that, you know, I've really enjoyed working with.

352
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:59,730
So if you sort of seek those people out and you finish up leading them,

353
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,009
as I've done on, you know, for quite a long time,

354
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,889
you've got to like them, you know, and you've got to want them,

355
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,889
you've got to allow them to shine, you know,

356
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,509
and you've got to want them to do well.

357
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:16,250
And then I think coach them, but not in a heavy-handed way.

358
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,950
I think that that's going to fail as well.

359
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,750
Coach them.

360
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,009
Coach them with a small C and delicately, you know,

361
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,450
go to places which are really important, I think,

362
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,710
for your collective success.

363
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,289
So in particular in my advertising life,

364
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,070
I needed creative people to do well.

365
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,009
So I needed to work out how to manage them because for me to do well,

366
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,149
I needed them to do well.

367
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,570
And what will often happen in a sort of an advertising agency situation

368
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,929
is that the management will,

369
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:48,429
will,

370
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,830
will not allow creative people to shine because it's safer, right?

371
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,210
So I, I was always up for, you know,

372
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:01,590
going to places which were really interesting and I,

373
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,849
and I would love leading the way in,

374
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,930
in selling ideas, you know, and selling concepts.

375
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:16,309
I really wanted to do my best for the client by convincing them that ideas

376
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,529
were really important, right?

377
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:18,690
So I don't know.

378
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,630
I sort of feel like I was both, you know,

379
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,910
at the front when I had to be,

380
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:27,029
but I was much happier just coaching people along and giving them a hand

381
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,809
at being their best.

382
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,190
Russ, there's a couple of things on that, that I've, you know,

383
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,269
I'm immediately interested straight away.

384
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,349
And I think you gave the caveat and said, you know,

385
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,970
saying you like diversity is cool now, but, you know,

386
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,130
clearly that has been part of your life.

387
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,730
And people like me, I'm finding it is an education.

388
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,369
You know, if you're, I'm a, you know, middle-aged now,

389
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:47,369
white male, Russ, who hasn't had, you know,

390
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,730
the exposure to being,

391
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,210
I suppose on the receiving end of what it's like to not be included.

392
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,549
And so, you know, in reality, you have to teach yourself and say,

393
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,250
a lot of Australians have a very different experience.

394
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,670
But so was it your creative sense that drew you to those people initially

395
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,789
that thought, hey, this is going to be great for me as well,

396
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,589
as much as you wanted to look out for other people?

397
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:08,069
Yeah.

398
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,849
I think that, you know, my father used to say to me, everyone's the same.

399
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,309
Like he'd say, we're all a balance sheet.

400
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:16,630
We've all got assets and liabilities.

401
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,650
And ultimately the balance sheet looks the same, right?

402
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,210
He was sort of very into, and, you know, he's, he's like us.

403
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,769
He's white, you know, he's got a, he had a very middle-class background,

404
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,670
but a very creative person.

405
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,490
My grandfather on my mother's side, he was a pharmacist in Footscray

406
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,750
and I'd go out there and work there.

407
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,710
And, you know, over summer, that was a pretty diverse, you know,

408
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,910
range of people that he was, he was very interesting fellow out there

409
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,930
in that he is very charitable and he was a sort of a leader out,

410
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,730
you know, in Footscray.

411
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,690
Um, the head of Rotary out there for years and, um,

412
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,230
had a great sort of generosity of spirit.

413
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,210
Um, again, was all, everyone's equal.

414
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,750
Um, that I think when I think about it now, I think that was a big part of me,

415
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:10,349
me growing up and I, you know, I mean, people that are tall have always annoyed me,

416
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:10,750
you know,

417
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,410
A bit of short man syndrome, Russ, along the journey.

418
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,089
You know, and people that were quick, they annoyed me as well.

419
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,630
I wasn't, I was never fast enough.

420
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,789
But, you know, but ultimately in there, and then it was a really powerful thing

421
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,250
that happened to me when I went to the UK.

422
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:33,009
Um, so I arrive as, as an Australian fella and I get a job at a, at really one of the

423
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,210
very best agencies in the world.

424
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,309
It was called Lowe Howard Spink, um, which now is sort of, there's still the Lowe group

425
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:42,950
around the world, but Lowe Howard Spink, London based, unbelievable agency.

426
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,269
Just at the point that I was there, I just got very lucky.

427
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:53,650
And being an Australian, they absolutely loaded me up with prejudice.

428
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,529
They loaded me up with that.

429
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:00,769
I was clearly a colonial, um, that I was fundamentally racist and that I had to be a

430
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:01,269
sexist.

431
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:01,690
All right.

432
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,049
That was just, they, they really genuinely loaded me up.

433
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,170
That was the British perception of what a young Australian would be like coming across.

434
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,509
Did that hit you in the face?

435
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,730
It absolutely did.

436
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,910
And then when I would say things that were maybe, you know, inappropriate, they, they

437
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,210
were on.

438
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,109
They were on to me very quickly.

439
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,470
And, and I learned a lot really fast when I was there.

440
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,849
And I, and I realized that I was coming from some prejudice.

441
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,609
Genuinely, I was, you know, I went to an all boys school for starters, right?

442
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,329
So that can have an effect on, on how you see life.

443
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,950
Thankfully, my, I, I only have sisters and all my cousins are girls slash women.

444
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,730
So, you know, I was always surrounded by women.

445
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,029
However, you know, there's going to have, there's going to be an effect, right?

446
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,109
So I, I, I think I was educated very on in my professional life.

447
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,690
Well, early on in my professional life that, um, you needed to just have a really broad

448
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,130
perspective.

449
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:58,630
And, and, you know, in the UK, it was fascinating in that they were really into getting different

450
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,349
skill bases from different areas.

451
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,509
You know, they would love getting the comedian from Essex, you know, and then they would

452
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:08,869
love to get the Northern, the Northern English person who was just the freak illustrator.

453
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:13,069
And they really sort of sought, this is a particular in the ad world maybe, but they

454
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,109
really sought difference.

455
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:16,170
Um, and I got along.

456
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,130
I got along really well in there in the end.

457
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,470
Well, you know, once, once I got over what, you know, their prejudice to me in the end,

458
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,509
they were pretty keen on me.

459
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,329
So, you know, we, we did well in the end.

460
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,730
I'm not surprised there.

461
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:30,289
Uh, so going back to what you, your first comment, you said that, you know, in leadership,

462
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:36,029
you found that for, for people in your role, it was safer to not let creative people shine

463
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:36,650
and thrive.

464
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,809
Why is that the case?

465
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,890
And what did you do to allow them to, to sort of, to thrive?

466
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,730
Well, I think in the, see, there's a, there's a bit of an interesting thing in that.

467
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,470
Um, commercially, you, you want the client to be happy, um, and you want them to be happy

468
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,009
because you want to, you want them to keep giving you money, right?

469
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:59,789
So, so sometimes you'll try hard to make it as easy for them as you possibly can, right?

470
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:04,690
And often the path of least resistance keeps, keeps everyone happy, right?

471
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,509
So, so you're acting as a servant to their needs.

472
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:15,150
Um, and that's okay to a point because you must be very conscious that you're not wasting

473
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,910
clients' money.

474
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,890
Well, all right, so they might have a good idea.

475
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,170
They may, they may feel very strongly, believe very strongly that what they want to do with

476
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,809
their money is right and it may well be right.

477
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,569
So you can facilitate that, but equally, you've got to be onto it.

478
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,450
You've got to be onto, no, there's a better way to do this because, you know, a client

479
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,630
spends a dollar, that dollar is either going to work reasonably well or work really well.

480
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,190
So let's work hard to make it work really well.

481
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:43,369
That is the path of least resistance mainly.

482
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,150
And you have to work really hard to get people to do it.

483
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:51,829
And you've got to find the language, I think, in order to help people understand it.

484
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,210
You can't say, Hey, Hey Luke, see this idea.

485
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,049
It's awesome.

486
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:56,730
It's going to sell.

487
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,089
You've got to work a bit harder than that, you know, trying to, trying to convince people

488
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,130
that is worth the, in many cases, millions of dollars of investment.

489
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,930
It's worth it.

490
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,990
And you've got to find the right argument to get people to understand that it's worth

491
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,170
it.

492
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,349
So I really enjoyed that challenge.

493
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,009
And, and in a leadership sense, getting people to do it.

494
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:16,089
Yeah.

495
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:16,150
Yeah.

496
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,450
And getting people around you that help you with that challenge.

497
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:20,730
It's, it's a great skill.

498
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,950
It's a, because you've sold ideas, Luke, right?

499
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,970
It's hard to do.

500
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:25,289
Yeah.

501
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,950
And, and in particular, I think in Australia, I don't like talking us down.

502
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,369
I like, I'm sort of, I like talking us up mainly, but we do like saying no.

503
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,789
And it's an easy word to say, and my God, it's a powerful word.

504
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,609
In business, no, you get stopped in your tracks, right?

505
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:42,930
Yeah.

506
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,150
So I used to say to clients, look, it can't be done.

507
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,930
Can we just agree that you're going to say maybe?

508
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,029
Before we start, let's get to maybe.

509
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,789
Let's get to maybe.

510
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:53,809
You do that up front, would you?

511
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,109
Yeah.

512
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,390
Yeah.

513
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,150
And, um, I used to play tricks as well with, um, just putting things on whiteboard, you

514
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,809
know, on the whiteboard.

515
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:08,269
One of the lovely tricks is you put on the whiteboard, assume good intent, and they wouldn't

516
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:09,990
know that you put it there just before the meeting.

517
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,990
They think that it's there because, you know, someone hasn't wiped down the whiteboard.

518
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,130
And as you do, as you do, when you walk into a meeting, you always,

519
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,990
you know, sort of scan the room and you'll just sort of see there, assume good intent.

520
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,450
I was convinced that they had this wonderful sort of subliminal power that the client would

521
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,289
actually, you know, behave in a different way.

522
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,890
Well, these people, they've got good intentions in mind, you know, they only have my, the

523
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,349
client's best interests in mind.

524
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,150
I'm going to assume good intent.

525
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,509
So I was very convinced that that was a, you know, a powerful way to conduct a meeting.

526
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,390
Did, you know, we did okay.

527
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:41,309
So maybe it worked.

528
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,890
One of the old sayings in the advertising world is that 50% of all advertising doesn't

529
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,049
work and 50% does.

530
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:48,130
We just don't know which 50.

531
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,609
So you're going to have to trust us.

532
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,730
And, uh, and the 50 that does is really power.

533
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,509
I love passion, right?

534
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,769
And I love it comes in so many different forms.

535
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:59,609
And your love of this space to me is so interesting.

536
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:03,470
And so could you just, for those listening that don't quite understand, and I'm thinking

537
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,470
maybe some of the great ad campaigns in history that come to mind, just to maybe share with

538
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,589
us why you love it so much.

539
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:15,769
Well, it's, it is genuinely the, the connection of commercial, commercial power and creativity.

540
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,369
You know, that, that's, that's ultimately the advertising space design also plays a

541
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,289
role, you know, so beautiful design.

542
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,269
So that tissue box that we're looking at there right now is a shocking bit of design, right?

543
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,529
So I'm highly unlikely to pick that one up in preference to a better design box.

544
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,250
And I feel a bit lazy that I left that out before our conversation started.

545
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:39,210
So you can do things well, or you can do things badly, you know, in a, in a commercial, in

546
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,990
an idea sense.

547
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,250
So I suppose ultimately my interest is in ideas.

548
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,650
And, um, I've always liked.

549
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,269
I liked a good idea and just throughout, you know, all my life, I've always just, I

550
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:55,230
don't know, my sort of core conversations about ideas, not just advertising ideas, just

551
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,609
ideas of all shapes and sizes.

552
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,470
So I, I just like them and I like what they can do.

553
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:06,690
And then in a, in an advertising sense, in particular, in the old mass media world, you

554
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,269
know, when 80% of the Australian population watched the eight 30 movie on a Sunday night,

555
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:15,250
whether it was on seven, nine or 10, and you would see an ad, you know, you'd see you ought

556
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,470
to be congratulated.

557
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,410
You know, Meadowlee, Margarine, and we, you'd see like literally 80% of the population would

558
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,809
see it at the same time.

559
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:26,690
Was that how big it was at the peak of, uh, of free to air TV?

560
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:28,750
The 80% of Australia was watching.

561
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,289
Yeah.

562
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:29,589
A given.

563
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:29,890
Yeah.

564
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,529
And you, you would roadblock the, uh, the commercial break.

565
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:35,970
So what a roadblock was, it was seven, nine and 10.

566
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,289
You would buy in this example, a Meadowlee ad at exactly the same time on every channel.

567
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,210
So if someone dared flick the channel, then they were going to see the same ad anyway,

568
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,509
right?

569
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,529
So I used to love saying, was that common?

570
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,609
Was that, Oh, you have to have a lot of money to do it.

571
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,549
You're a big advertiser.

572
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,029
If you did it.

573
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:51,289
Yeah.

574
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,089
I used to say, you know, who invented the remote?

575
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,369
So whoever, whoever invented the remote control wasn't into advertising.

576
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:03,170
Remote control is completely stuffed advertising because you know, if you go right back to

577
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,289
when I was a kid, you had to get off your couch to go and change the channel.

578
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:07,970
So of course you had to watch the ads.

579
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,890
Anyway, people avoid ads now.

580
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:11,490
I don't know why they do that, but they do.

581
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,329
I remember when the first remotes came in, it was a, you know, I remember, you know,

582
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,589
some people used to sit on the couch with a pool cue and you know, that was sort of

583
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,349
your chance to press the button and change channels.

584
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:24,829
But I used to love, um, when, when we purchased the Big Bash, when I was at 10 and we purchased

585
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:30,609
Big Bash, I used to love going around, you know, selling the ad space, selling to big,

586
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,509
you know, big advertisers.

587
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,170
We'd tell, talk, talk to them about Big Bash and what we were going to do with Big Bash.

588
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,950
I said, look, the best thing about Big Bash is that the cricket gets in the way of the

589
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,269
ads.

590
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,809
I'm sure Cricket Australia would love that.

591
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:45,170
Yeah.

592
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,789
Six balls, then an ad.

593
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,630
Well, no, no, no.

594
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,230
It's an ad, then there's six balls.

595
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,809
I don't know, you could get away with that, with saying that.

596
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:57,710
I didn't quite get out of you, just an ad that people will know and why it's, why it's

597
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,309
good and why you have such passion for it.

598
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,069
Well, okay.

599
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:05,970
So if we think about our world, our, the, your, the great game you've played brilliantly

600
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,869
and the game I'm passionate and love and, you know, the AFL has done some brilliant

601
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,369
ads over, over, well, 20, 30 year period.

602
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,730
You know, I'd like to see that.

603
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,849
Which was a brilliant, a, seriously, that is a brilliant campaign where they were able

604
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:26,809
to sort of compare the, the skill, the skill of, um, a Australian rules athlete to the

605
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,609
skills of athletes from all around the world.

606
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,210
That was a very, really significant idea.

607
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:32,829
The Campaign Palace did it originally.

608
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,009
Campaign Palace is one of the great agencies, Luke, which, uh, which I'm sad to say doesn't

609
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:38,650
exist anymore.

610
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,789
Um, in fact, when I was the head of Y&R Brands, Campaign Palace reported into me and I, and

611
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,210
my, the bosses in New York, we decided that we couldn't go on any longer, any longer with

612
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,769
Campaign Palace.

613
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,410
That was sad.

614
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,829
Campaign Palace then moved into George Patterson.

615
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,490
Um, and George Patterson created that beautiful campaign.

616
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,490
You might remember where, you know, one of the opening scenes, you've got Gary Ablett

617
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,450
Jr. dodging a Toyota Land Cruiser, you know, and we had Chris Judd outrunning a stallion.

618
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,569
And I think we had Brownie on a gridiron field.

619
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,210
Um, oh.

620
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,950
And, uh, who was on the ice park, on the ice hockey rink?

621
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:17,869
I can't remember anyway.

622
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,250
We had a whole series of athletes comparing and beating, you know, global athletes.

623
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,869
It was good.

624
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:28,230
My mind went to, uh, Wayne Carey, the Roo Boy at his, at his peak, which was a Nike

625
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,210
ad too, which had a bit of that, him bowling over large objects and, uh.

626
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:36,890
And I got sent today a VB ad with Warnie in it.

627
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:37,809
Oh, wow.

628
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,269
Yeah.

629
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,789
And actually I'll, I'll flick it to you after this.

630
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,750
It is just a, it's a, it's a great.

631
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,730
It's a great commercial and it just shows the passion that people, that the people creating

632
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,009
the ad, it was George Patterson at the time for VB, the, literally you can see the passion

633
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,829
that the people making the ad have for Warnie and the passion for him to perform really

634
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,930
well and the passion he had for Cairns, obviously.

635
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,789
But it was just a really fantastic, great little, great little commercial.

636
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,130
We have to jump off there just for a moment, Russ.

637
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,009
We're sitting in the week where, um, we tragically lost Shane Warne and, um, anyone who was lucky

638
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,089
enough to come into his orbit.

639
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:13,630
As I know.

640
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,069
You did.

641
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:17,809
And I felt fortunate enough in, in the, the times you saw him, fortunate enough to have

642
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,650
some very funny and enjoyable nights, uh, involved with him.

643
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,289
Extraordinary person.

644
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,529
So unique in Australian culture who owned his mistakes, Russ, I think.

645
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:27,730
That's it.

646
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,009
Better than anyone I know.

647
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:29,450
That's right.

648
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,970
I think that was a superpower for, for him.

649
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,029
What are your thoughts when you, when you reflect on that?

650
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:35,869
That's absolutely his superpower.

651
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:42,730
And he, he was, he was so, actually, I think he was very objective about himself.

652
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,809
I think he had a very clear perspective about who and what he, what he is, was.

653
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,789
And he, he, he could be ashamed of himself, right?

654
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,049
But he was willing to admit that that wasn't good news, you know?

655
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,150
And I think that is, there's great power in, in that.

656
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,109
I actually think he was a very clever man.

657
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,730
I, I watched him last night.

658
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,549
They repeated the Lee Sayles interview.

659
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,789
And you could actually see a really strong intellect there, you know?

660
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:09,970
So we all know that he had cricket smarts, but I think that that might be underdoing it.

661
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,710
I think he was a really emotionally clever person.

662
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,009
And he was able to, well, he could think people out, you know, on the cricket field.

663
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:23,529
But I think that he was able to really sum, sum, summarize a situation at a very high level.

664
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,490
Like high EQ, they would call it, wouldn't they?

665
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,809
Like, and I, I, I genuinely think that's the case.

666
00:31:28,109 --> 00:31:29,230
Just one quick story.

667
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:36,890
I was, in 2015, I was at Lords watching Australia play England.

668
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,250
And I was lucky enough to be asked into that, you know, the beautiful pavilion, the members pavilion.

669
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,569
Amazing.

670
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:42,589
I was.

671
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,170
I was asked to go into the Australian dressing rooms after they'd won.

672
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:51,789
And as I walked into that pavilion, there is this stunning portrait of Shane Warne.

673
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:53,450
So that in itself is interesting.

674
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:59,170
That is in the MCC, Marylebone Cricket Clubs, you know, that stunning pavilion that Shane Warne's there.

675
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:02,109
What's more interesting, he's in position 1A.

676
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,829
Like, they've put him in the very, the very premium position.

677
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,890
Such was how he was seen by the English.

678
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,710
They thoroughly loved him.

679
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,170
They loved the man.

680
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,289
And I think that he felt very comfortable there.

681
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,390
I think he felt that he could be himself there.

682
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,549
And they would have loved that larrikin nature, of course, you know.

683
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:22,690
Yeah.

684
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:27,750
You know, and there's that lovely, you know, and he was sort of like, he was a walking headline for the sun.

685
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:28,750
Right?

686
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,630
They would have loved him.

687
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,069
And we'll talk to you a bit about communication, which is clearly a huge part of your success in life.

688
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,549
But I, it was an amazing communicator too, Warne.

689
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:38,710
Yeah.

690
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,329
From even a social level.

691
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:42,690
I used to marvel that you'd be calling the footy in a St.

692
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:51,130
Louis game and you guarantee wherever he was in the world, you'd get, you know, if you, if you called something that he didn't like, you'd get a message or he was very inclusive if you were in town and there was something on.

693
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,490
He was extraordinary at collecting and collaborating people.

694
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,369
We missed one of them.

695
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:55,529
Lovely thing.

696
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,950
You know, Russ, whenever I had the pleasure of being in your company, you've got a great energy.

697
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:05,170
You know, you've always got this, you smile, you're up and you always feel inspired, you know, from spending some time.

698
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,549
Is that always been you?

699
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,950
Is that, is that part of your DNA or is that something you worked on?

700
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,049
No, I think it is me.

701
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,430
I think, thank you for saying that, Luke.

702
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:24,750
Um, on the radio the other day, my, um, stepmother, she's known as Elizabeth the second, my first, my, my father's first wife is Elizabeth, Elizabeth the first.

703
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,029
She's still alive.

704
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,309
My father's no longer alive.

705
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:29,970
And my father's second wife is also Elizabeth.

706
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,369
She's known as Elizabeth the second.

707
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:38,529
Anyway, so she was, um, on the radio talking about a project she's working on at the moment.

708
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,710
And, um, anyway, so they picked up on her surname and they said.

709
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,329
Oh, are you related?

710
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,930
And she said, yes, I'm Elizabeth the second.

711
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:50,250
And they said, um, is there anything, you know, can you tell us anything about when he was a younger fella?

712
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:02,210
He said, well, in the mornings he used to come down and he'd go to the shower singing, just call me angel of the morning, which was like, the tragedy is that's true.

713
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:05,670
So maybe I've always been a bit like that.

714
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,710
Just, you know, positive.

715
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:08,190
I have, yeah, I am a positive person.

716
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,929
On talkback during the pandemic.

717
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,590
Um, I used to occasionally be.

718
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:23,949
Accused of having, being, uh, being false positive, which, which was good language, you know, cause at the time things were a bit heavy and I was sort of, I'm not trying to find the positive things.

719
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,110
It's just, I suppose that's how I look at it.

720
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,530
And it's unique, Russ.

721
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,789
And it's such a special gift to have that around people.

722
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,250
Cause I think we think the human mind often does catch the negative too often and more often.

723
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,650
And you hang on to those things that are challenging and not celebrating the things that, that are more joyful.

724
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,369
So, uh, it is great.

725
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,309
Hopefully it's not too false too often, but yeah.

726
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,570
I don't suspect there's anything false about anything you do, Russ.

727
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:57,349
We're talking through the lens of leadership a bit today and we've been identifying, we're seeing a real shift in the way leaders are about being more collaborative, Russ, more self-reflective.

728
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:01,590
It seems a new era away from hierarchy and command and control.

729
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,130
And at the moment in America, they're calling it the great resignation.

730
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,670
In Australia, I think the phrase has been termed the great reshuffle.

731
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,849
Are you seeing that, that, that trend as well?

732
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,210
And is, is, is leadership.

733
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,650
Going to play a role in that?

734
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:25,969
I actually, you know, you know, if we, if we're talking about politicians, right, politics, you still, in the end have to have a great perspective about where we're going to go and why we're going to go there.

735
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:29,150
And you have to have, I think the ability to sell that as well.

736
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:29,610
Yeah.

737
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:36,250
I think that that is something which, which we've seen in a political, when we see it in a political sense, we know it and we like it.

738
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:36,489
Yeah.

739
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:36,849
Yeah.

740
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,570
I do think that leadership matters.

741
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,869
It matters enormously.

742
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,130
I actually respect all politicians.

743
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,070
It doesn't matter their colour because they're doing it and I'm not.

744
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:45,570
Yeah.

745
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,849
Yeah.

746
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,030
I genuinely do.

747
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,329
Right.

748
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,070
So they are, they are putting themselves in that position.

749
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:59,010
They're putting themselves up for all that, you know, the debate and the, the ups and the downs and they can, they can, they can get scarred pretty heavily.

750
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,250
Yeah.

751
00:35:59,289 --> 00:35:59,469
Right.

752
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,750
And so I do respect them.

753
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,230
Um, I like to listen to them and I like to try and think it through.

754
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:10,809
Um, I have a, I have a leaning in a particular way, but equally I might, I might hear some arguments from, you know, the other side.

755
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,190
You go, well, actually, you know, that makes a lot of sense.

756
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,289
But I, yeah, I do.

757
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,590
First and foremost, I respect them.

758
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,389
Yeah.

759
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:16,969
And that's great.

760
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,010
But again, it's, it's your natural inclination.

761
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,750
And I, and you know, when you're reflecting here, you say that I do.

762
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,530
And so we should, because I know I could never do that or never want to do it.

763
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,449
Well, you could do it if you wanted to do it.

764
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,130
But I wouldn't be prepared.

765
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:30,050
We'd be all be better off if you did do it.

766
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,929
I'd be not prepared to put up with what would be required and the sacrifice and the cost.

767
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,730
So you're right.

768
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:42,190
It's easier to, from the outside say, I don't necessarily like where it's heading, but if you're not prepared to put yourself in the arena on that one, you're not going to do it.

769
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,829
And you're probably right.

770
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,610
We probably do need to pay a bit more respect.

771
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,369
Hey, we started talking about this just before we started recording.

772
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:55,630
Interestingly, we got onto the schools and we've, we've, we've, our kids have gone to the same school and we're talking from your lens, creativity that pours out of you.

773
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,190
One of the most watched TED Talks ever.

774
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,130
I'm not sure if you've seen it.

775
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,849
So Ken Robinson, 73 million people have downloaded it.

776
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:03,949
Have you, have you seen it?

777
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:06,190
The title is Do Schools Kill Creativity?

778
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,289
It's a, it's a great TED Talk.

779
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:10,130
Go and check it out if you, if you haven't seen it.

780
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,110
It resonates really strongly with me.

781
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,590
Did it have the same effect on you?

782
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:14,289
Fundamentally.

783
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,110
The, it's really interesting.

784
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,889
There's some data that was done and I'll, I'll have to paraphrase it because I can't remember precisely.

785
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:38,010
But when NASA was trying to find the super freaks to put in a rocket and send to the moon, they, they created some studies, some research, I should say, to find the individual that was highly analytical to be expected, but highly creative.

786
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,610
All right.

787
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:42,010
And they created this research that could in effect measure creativity.

788
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:53,510
And then they, over the years, and they still use this research, they've, they've discovered that, you know, that 95% of five-year-olds have got creativity at the genius level.

789
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,789
When they're 10, it's about 75% of 10-year-olds.

790
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,150
When they're 15, it's sort of 35%.

791
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,750
By the time we're sort of young adults, most of the creativity has been taught out of us.

792
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,050
Uh, that is clearly a problem.

793
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,429
It's pretty sad when you, when you point it out as directly as that.

794
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:10,590
Yeah.

795
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,070
You can track it.

796
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,309
I'll, I'll have to send you the actual data, but it is, I'm broadly right.

797
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:17,090
There's another thing on YouTube.

798
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,090
So watch that one.

799
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,750
The, uh, that.

800
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,590
Sir Ken Robinson's TED Talk.

801
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:21,849
Yeah.

802
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:22,369
Watch that.

803
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:26,570
The other one to watch is the, um, the spaghetti, uh, challenge.

804
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:38,590
And the spaghetti challenge is you've got 20 strands of spaghetti, sticky tape, and some string and chewing gum or bubble gum, you know, like a ball of bubble gum.

805
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:38,769
Yep.

806
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,369
You've got to build the tallest tower with spaghetti.

807
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,170
You put bubble gum on.

808
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,510
Now, accountants are terrible at it.

809
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,510
Um, good news is architects are pretty good at it, but you know who else is really good at it?

810
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,510
Kindergarten kids.

811
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,949
And they're really good at it because they collaborate and they, when it doesn't work, they don't care.

812
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:56,670
Yeah.

813
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:00,250
They just, they just keep going until they find some sort of solution.

814
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:06,750
It's another beautiful example that yes, school absolutely does teach creativity out of kids.

815
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:10,929
Um, you know, my, it's rather nice story in my family.

816
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:11,789
My father was.

817
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:19,030
The ducks of, of art at school, my grand, my, my son was ducks of art at school and he said, oh, good on you, Louie.

818
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,909
Well done ducks of art.

819
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:21,690
He said, dad, there's only six people doing it.

820
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,130
He said, well, yeah, there was only six people doing it, but 240 had the opportunity to do it.

821
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,889
So that is a, that's not good, is it?

822
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:35,070
So at, at a school, at a school, big school, plenty of resources, 240 kids, six people do art.

823
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:35,630
Yeah.

824
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:36,070
Right.

825
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,710
It's just mad.

826
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,409
So there needs to be far greater effort put into.

827
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:52,329
And especially as AI becomes a huge part of our lives, um, where the AI, the bots, the machines are going to do so much, um, so much and lit analytical work.

828
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,349
The thing that we've got over robots is creativity.

829
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,730
Yeah.

830
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:58,329
So we have to work much harder at that.

831
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:05,969
So the rote learning aspect and the, you know, the textbook learning needs to be upended clearly and, and engage kids.

832
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,349
Is it as simple as that?

833
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,389
It is as simple as that.

834
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,389
And there needs to be a complete overhaul.

835
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,289
I mean, it's fascinating, isn't it?

836
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:17,809
When you, when you go to school, you're, you're, you're measured on a one, one-to-one basis.

837
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:18,949
Your teacher measures you.

838
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,769
What have you done in your work life, which is just you?

839
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,570
Right.

840
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,190
Almost nothing.

841
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,469
Nothing.

842
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,829
Yeah.

843
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,269
Yeah.

844
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:29,849
We, you absolutely have to collaborate, cooperate, create together.

845
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,570
Yeah.

846
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,090
And now that happens in other fields at school.

847
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,650
You do your house sports or you do your footy or your cricket, whatever.

848
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,190
So yes, it's not like it's devoid of the notion of the collective, but.

849
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,110
Yeah.

850
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,030
It's not really taught as core, as a core curriculum.

851
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:47,010
And that is genuinely, that's genuinely a problem.

852
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:52,050
I'm rather proud of the fact that, so second, the other son, I don't even know what he got for VCE.

853
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,469
I'm not even sure he got double figures.

854
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:54,969
Right.

855
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,550
I can also tell you, I don't care.

856
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,889
Yeah.

857
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,269
And he's a highly creative cat and he is doing really well in life.

858
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:03,750
Right.

859
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:11,070
So it, and I, of course that's a nice story because it's him, but I do feel like we're

860
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,650
just, there's too many kids with high creativity, high capability that are just streamed in

861
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,409
another direction and it's sad.

862
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,530
It's a, it's a great conversation, Russ, one to explore further another time.

863
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,969
And I think this obsession with an ATAR or a score, what does it mean to Russell Howcroft

864
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:28,989
or anyone really?

865
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,010
I mean, there's probably a couple of disciplines where that makes sense, but for everyone else,

866
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,630
there's a, there's a huge disruption that is required.

867
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:40,510
On that note, Russ, we've been, I'm fascinated with your creative brain on this because we've

868
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,050
been identifying.

869
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,949
And the work we're doing, a business called A Leader, supporting educators and leaders

870
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,409
in sport and industry and the arts.

871
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,590
And we're identifying these different traits that we think make great leadership.

872
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:51,610
I want to ask you about these different traits.

873
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,750
So please expand, Russ, as much as, as you feel comfortable with, in your hands with

874
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:56,849
that.

875
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:00,590
One of the, one of the traits we're seeing is self-leadership is a big thing that most

876
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,750
people have an understanding of.

877
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:01,949
Yes.

878
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,150
What does self-leadership mean to you?

879
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,210
Well, I, I really like that.

880
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,269
And, and haven't we discovered during the pandemic that self-leadership is real, you

881
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:09,449
know?

882
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:11,030
So the individual who gets out of bed.

883
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,909
And they're, they're by themselves.

884
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:16,130
They've been by themselves in their own workspace at home.

885
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,429
I mean, obviously we're talking about laptop workers, but they've self-started and they've

886
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:22,409
got on with their day.

887
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:26,730
And what's been, I think, very interesting for people is the notion that you can trust

888
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,469
the vast majority of people, um, which is something that I've always believed in there.

889
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:37,269
You know, it's, it's just as a silly aside at an agency that I started when I was 29.

890
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,809
I had a thing called the trust tract as opposed to the contract.

891
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,590
Cause I thought a contract, the first three letters is a bit of a problem, right?

892
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:51,269
So the notion that we should all, uh, back to school when I was in year 12 at school,

893
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,349
I'd try it.

894
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:54,489
And I was on the, you know, there was a school council or something.

895
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,250
I tried to get them to take all the locks off the lockers.

896
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,329
I said, well, why can't, surely we should trust people first and foremost.

897
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,110
Right.

898
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,929
And then if individual X is found to have done the wrong thing, I had gone into someone

899
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:08,590
else's locker.

900
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,550
Then the punishment.

901
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,449
Is really heavy, right?

902
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:16,409
So first and foremost, you trust second of all, you punish very, very heavily.

903
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:21,030
That to me is a far better perspective, especially with young people.

904
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,449
We're going to trust you all.

905
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,489
That's a better perspective.

906
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,550
How did that idea go, Russ?

907
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,389
Cause I love it.

908
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:26,670
Yeah.

909
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:28,110
There's still locks on the lockers.

910
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:34,210
It's just, it is, it's extraordinary that, that first and foremost, we want to sort of

911
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,250
assume, assume ill intent, right?

912
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,949
It's just, it's just not on.

913
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,590
So self-starting is.

914
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:45,050
I think it's about trust and it's about, yes, people are, they know they've got to

915
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,710
get on and do a good day's work.

916
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,869
Cause they know if they don't, they're not going to get paid at a really basic level.

917
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,889
And the notion that everyone is a leader, I think is really important.

918
00:43:55,409 --> 00:44:00,210
And you know, when you do values, I wrote the values when I was at network 10 for the

919
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:00,510
network.

920
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,329
And one of the values was everyone's a leader.

921
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:09,570
And then that, I think if you practice that, then that really does, it's got a chance of

922
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,710
embedding it into culture.

923
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:18,010
Something I learned at PWC, they do this thing called a value share, a values share

924
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:25,829
where they literally in meetings say, okay, who'd like to share with us a, a, our values

925
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,530
in action.

926
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:32,369
So the other day I saw Luke do X, which reflects our, the value of meritocracy.

927
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,670
Good on you, Luke.

928
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:36,710
It sounds really weird, right?

929
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,869
It's almost Scientology.

930
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,789
However, it really works.

931
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,690
I, I, I'm a full convert.

932
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:43,969
I think it's a brilliant thing to do.

933
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,349
I'm the chair of the Australian film school at the start of every council meeting.

934
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:52,429
I do a value share and it's, it's an opportunity for people to talk about how the school is

935
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:53,550
reflecting what it wants to be.

936
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:54,590
It's brilliant.

937
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:55,590
You know, I love it, Russ.

938
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,590
And we talk about this a lot on this part, even, you know, celebrating what people are

939
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,090
doing well.

940
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,130
It's been a missed opportunity so often in the past that we find just having that moment

941
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,590
to reflect and say, Hey, first and foremost, we move on to the next.

942
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,469
What, what can we say?

943
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:11,389
I love doing it through the, the lens of value.

944
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:13,550
I love your trust track as well.

945
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,070
I think that's such a brilliant thought.

946
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:16,550
Did people, did you change it?

947
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:16,869
Did you?

948
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:17,909
I love it.

949
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:18,369
I love it.

950
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:19,550
So you're the staff member.

951
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:26,829
I was 29, started an agency and, and when new employees came, they got a trust tract.

952
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:31,349
That is why we love the creativity of you, Russ.

953
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:36,150
We see leaders also a dimension we, we talk about really conscious of how they positively

954
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,389
impact others in their environment.

955
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:40,610
What's the lens through which you say that?

956
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:48,369
Yeah, well, vulnerability, of course, that it is, again, it's a bit of a, it's a bit

957
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:49,690
of a cliche now, isn't it?

958
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,230
But we do see it and we see that it's really powerful.

959
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:59,050
And, um, well, Luke Sayers is, uh, he was former CEO of PwC.

960
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,349
He started the Sayers group.

961
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:01,489
I'm a founding partner in that.

962
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,250
He's now the president of Carlton.

963
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,710
Here is someone, he was a, he, he embodies that new style of leadership, right?

964
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,710
He's, he's.

965
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:13,949
He is that, you know, when he's led thousands of people to PwC, right?

966
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,969
And basically doubled the business over his eight years as the boss.

967
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,150
And he is a perfect new style president for a footy club as well.

968
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,670
And that, that, that's the style of leader that he is.

969
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,889
And he wants input.

970
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,510
He's prepared to show vulnerability.

971
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:32,030
He's prepared to, you know, demonstrate when things are right, when things are wrong, wants

972
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,369
to talk about it, asks really uncomfortable questions.

973
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:38,289
You know, it's like, are you really asking me that?

974
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,389
But he does.

975
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:45,329
It's a, it's a very interesting, and I think what it does, it, and it's, and it's all in

976
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:47,690
an, in, in an environment of trust.

977
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,150
Cause if you're, if you're on his team, then he trusts you.

978
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,989
So there's no, there's no risk associated.

979
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:56,809
Just you say it as it is.

980
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:59,429
I think that's a really, that's a very powerful thing, isn't it?

981
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:05,789
If you feel vulnerable, you are unlikely to play a open, honest, trusting game.

982
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,889
If you feel strong and part of a team, you will be able to play.

983
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:11,309
In that new style of leadership.

984
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,909
Yeah.

985
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:14,989
It's brilliant to celebrate that style and see the success.

986
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:19,409
It equates to commercial success and it equates to happiness and more productivity.

987
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:23,409
And, um, I look forward to, to, to hopefully chatting to Luke at some stage.

988
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:23,670
Yeah.

989
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,630
You should get him on here.

990
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,110
We're very keen to, to, uh, to catch up with Luke Sayers.

991
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,150
I'll follow up that idea.

992
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:28,530
Yeah.

993
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:33,489
The idea of leaders creating and sharing a vision, I feel like is right to your forehand,

994
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,289
Russ, because you've done that through your world regularly.

995
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,590
How have you gone about creating and sharing a vision?

996
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:46,090
It's an interesting one, Luke, because I agree with you and I enjoy the process of developing

997
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:46,510
vision.

998
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,309
Um, I, I believe in it.

999
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,010
I really believe in core purpose.

1000
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:55,789
You know, it's, again, it's sort of, it's become, it's become something that brands

1001
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,389
talk about.

1002
00:47:56,389 --> 00:48:00,710
I'm not as interested in it from a brand point of view, like core purpose of a brand,

1003
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:02,969
you know, soap to make you clean.

1004
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:08,429
I'm not, you know, that sort of, it's a given, it's a given, you know, and so what they do

1005
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:09,750
is that we're going to.

1006
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,289
Because we make people clean, we're going to clean the world or, you know, they, they

1007
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:13,929
try and find a.

1008
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,909
Esoteric sort of.

1009
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:15,090
Yeah.

1010
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:16,289
Doesn't work for you.

1011
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:16,889
Not really.

1012
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,250
In, in that sort of consumer brand world.

1013
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,369
Yeah.

1014
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:19,949
Not really.

1015
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,489
Um, you just need a proposition that sells, right?

1016
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,469
We clean really well.

1017
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:23,730
Yeah.

1018
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:24,050
Yeah.

1019
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,789
There might be underlying things, how you build your soap.

1020
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,130
That's important, right?

1021
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,090
I, we don't use slave labor, for example, right?

1022
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:32,250
Yeah.

1023
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:38,210
So I, I sort of get that, but corporate purpose or purpose around team, um, I really, really

1024
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:38,949
believe in that.

1025
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:39,610
And, and.

1026
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,530
Finding the right words is a, is a very, it's an interesting exercise.

1027
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:50,030
Um, and if you get it right, it can be, it can be extremely powerful and it is something

1028
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,949
that you then can practice every day.

1029
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:58,989
You know, I mean, I'm PwC again, core purpose, building trust in society and solving important

1030
00:48:58,989 --> 00:48:59,929
problems, right?

1031
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:02,690
So we're going to build trust and we go and we're going to solve important problems.

1032
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:06,789
Well, did it, did I like going to a place every single day that did that?

1033
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,309
Right.

1034
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:07,469
Yeah.

1035
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,530
And, and they fully practiced it.

1036
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:09,730
Yeah.

1037
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,329
Every single day.

1038
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:16,750
So I had great joy in, in, in, in, in working in a purposeful business.

1039
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,929
And then I've done a lot of work with clients around core purpose, which again, I really

1040
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:21,449
enjoy.

1041
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,650
Nailing it is hard, but I'll tell you what's harder is getting them to spend the money

1042
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,409
on distributing that core purpose to their staff.

1043
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:36,230
So what will often happen is you'll do a job with a, a board, a CEO, an executive suite,

1044
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:39,570
develop core purpose, and it gets turned into a PowerPoint.

1045
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:44,250
And it may be a t-shirt, you know, it's sort of not a lived and breathed experience.

1046
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,309
So, so getting your leadership to understand the value of, of, of sharing that down.

1047
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:54,150
And so you're, so, so paraphrasing your, if it's authentic, authentically done and, and,

1048
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,510
and some businesses, Patagonia clothing is a legendary business, you know, probably started

1049
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,849
what B Corps look like.

1050
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:01,110
Yes.

1051
00:50:01,409 --> 00:50:06,610
Uh, organizations that sign up to a set of values that mean they live things like, um,

1052
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,489
you know, their impact on the environment and sustainability and a really powerful, you know,

1053
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:09,909
powerful way.

1054
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:11,449
So that's a subtlety for you.

1055
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:13,769
If you're authentically doing that, you're on board.

1056
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,710
If you're trying to grab a link to tick a box, it doesn't work.

1057
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:17,309
Not really.

1058
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,349
I, I, there was a, there was a book written a long time ago around lighthouse strategy

1059
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:25,289
and lighthouse strategy being build the lighthouse and then put out the beam and then the beam

1060
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:26,150
will catch consumers.

1061
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:26,849
Yeah.

1062
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:28,429
And then, and they're your consumers.

1063
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,150
So the peak, that picture in your mind is, is a really good one.

1064
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,429
And I sort of use that picture when I think about purpose.

1065
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:39,489
So purpose being the lighthouse and then it will be attracted, right, to people will be

1066
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,570
attracted to that, to that by the beam of light that you push out there.

1067
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:44,110
I actually do believe that.

1068
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:49,989
And I think that core purpose done well at a corporate level in effect becomes your advertising.

1069
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:50,829
Yeah.

1070
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:53,030
You don't have to put a whole lot of other layers onto it.

1071
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,510
That, that should be enough.

1072
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:55,550
Yeah.

1073
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:01,250
That's fascinating from an advertiser that, uh, if you get purpose right, it's more powerful

1074
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,170
than any advertising.

1075
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:04,849
That's a really interesting takeaway for me, Russ.

1076
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:08,969
We're seeing leaders see curiosity as a, as a real, a real strength.

1077
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:09,469
And, you know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1078
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:10,469
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1079
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:14,869
like you and they, and their approach to their own self-improvement learning through curiosity.

1080
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:16,090
Does that, does that make sense?

1081
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:16,849
You got to have a library.

1082
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:17,650
Yeah.

1083
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,610
I think I genuinely, you must have a library.

1084
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,309
You must forever be looking for things, new things I think are really important.

1085
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,829
I mean, I, I used to read a lot in terms of books.

1086
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:32,030
I'm, I'm trying to get back into reading books, but I always used to business books.

1087
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,309
I used to love business books, you know, marketing, advertising, any business book.

1088
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:39,670
If you could leave a, if you could leave a business book with, you know, one thing that

1089
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,289
helps you, you know, be better, then that was probably, you know, worth the read.

1090
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:51,289
So yeah, I, I genuinely try hard to, I don't know whether anyone's more curious than Ross

1091
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:51,809
Stevenson.

1092
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,190
I mean, he's, he's up there.

1093
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,369
Um, I try and catch up to him most days.

1094
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:56,230
He's deeply curious.

1095
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,570
That's a great thing.

1096
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,869
That's a great skill of his, of course.

1097
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,869
But yeah, uh, one mustn't be closed, you know, and you certainly must never think that you

1098
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:05,289
know everything.

1099
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:06,050
I mean, obviously.

1100
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:11,429
So always being on the lookout for, and I think being on the lookout for truth is not

1101
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,530
really accurate either.

1102
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,690
I'm not big on that one.

1103
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,190
I think that there's always two sides to the coin.

1104
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:19,849
It's quite interesting when you think about the idea that truth was a bit of a game that

1105
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:20,269
was played.

1106
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,829
Ancient Greece, we're talking here, Dars.

1107
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:26,590
The, the notion that you, we would debate in order to find the truth was a game.

1108
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:26,969
Really?

1109
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,429
Yeah.

1110
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,570
So, you know, Plato.

1111
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,269
So it's, it, it does depend a bit on it.

1112
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:33,510
It's, it's in the eye of the beholder.

1113
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,849
There was always, there's always.

1114
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:37,869
There's always different forms of the truth.

1115
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:44,289
And I think sort of discovering both sides, sometimes I can be a bit contrarian because

1116
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:47,170
I quite like, actually, it isn't like that.

1117
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,889
It isn't like how we all think it is and coming up with a contrarian way, which maybe isn't

1118
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:55,929
that endearing sometimes, but it's sort of, I think it's important.

1119
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,190
Well, I find that fascinating.

1120
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:01,369
You're going back to ancient Greece, but we're, you know, in an era now of, you know, the

1121
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:04,170
concept of fake news is, is such a common term.

1122
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:04,289
Yeah.

1123
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:04,329
Yeah.

1124
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:04,349
Yeah.

1125
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:04,369
Yeah.

1126
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:04,389
Yeah.

1127
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:04,409
Yeah.

1128
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:04,429
Yeah.

1129
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:04,449
Yeah.

1130
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:04,469
Yeah.

1131
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:04,489
Yeah.

1132
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:04,530
Yeah.

1133
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:04,550
Yeah.

1134
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:04,610
Yeah.

1135
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:04,650
Yeah.

1136
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:04,670
Yeah.

1137
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:04,690
Yeah.

1138
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:04,730
Yeah.

1139
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:04,769
Yeah.

1140
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:04,849
Yeah.

1141
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:04,909
Yeah.

1142
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,869
Yeah.

1143
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:06,889
Yeah.

1144
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:07,309
Yeah.

1145
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:07,369
Yeah.

1146
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:07,710
Yeah.

1147
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:07,730
Yeah.

1148
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:07,829
Yeah.

1149
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,869
Yeah.

1150
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:08,030
Yeah.

1151
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,110
Yeah.

1152
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:08,269
Yeah.

1153
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:08,289
Yeah.

1154
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:08,769
On purpose.

1155
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,949
And then, then this search now to, to, to look up something that, you know, may be relevant.

1156
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,349
I agree with your perspective.

1157
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,150
The idea to be able to debate truth is a really important thing.

1158
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,409
Yes.

1159
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:24,469
Now we're getting debate on, on censored, people getting canceled, people being taken off these

1160
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:28,610
massive platforms because your opinion, you know, is regarded as dangerous.

1161
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:28,909
Yeah.

1162
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:33,630
I mean, that, that is a, do you, is that a new thing or you're saying that goes all the

1163
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,130
way back?

1164
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,030
Because I, I find that a little, right, I mean, we lived through the last two years of

1165
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:41,769
lockdowns and pandemics and things that should have been really heavily debated.

1166
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:42,110
Yep.

1167
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,369
Don't feel like that's been available.

1168
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:44,750
None.

1169
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,630
And information, whatever version of truth has been pretty hard to find.

1170
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:49,050
Yeah.

1171
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:53,590
Well, it's very interesting because at, at, it's good, this is a good discussion you've

1172
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:53,730
asked.

1173
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:58,150
I, at my, at, right down to my bootstraps, I'm a hardcore libertarian.

1174
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:01,489
I'm, I'm liberal with a small L, right?

1175
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,329
I, I like discussion.

1176
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:04,030
I like debate.

1177
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:10,389
I, I, people, people being forced to do things that they don't want to do, I, I, I find it

1178
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,230
really hard to, to support that.

1179
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,590
Yeah.

1180
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,869
Just generally, you know, in a, in a, in my heart.

1181
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,369
Yeah.

1182
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,550
However, the rational part of these, of the discussion and the argument also has to be

1183
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,349
taken into account.

1184
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,449
And so I found myself every day over the last two years in conflict.

1185
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:26,889
Yeah.

1186
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:30,969
Because in my heart, I couldn't stand a lot of what was going on, but in my head I could

1187
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:31,650
understand it.

1188
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,050
Yeah.

1189
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,250
Yeah.

1190
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,269
Yeah.

1191
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:32,289
Yeah.

1192
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:32,309
Yeah.

1193
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,329
Yeah.

1194
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:32,349
Yeah.

1195
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:32,389
Yeah.

1196
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:32,409
Yeah.

1197
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:32,429
Yeah.

1198
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:32,449
Yeah.

1199
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:32,469
Yeah.

1200
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:32,510
Yeah.

1201
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:32,530
Yeah.

1202
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:32,550
Yeah.

1203
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,590
Yeah.

1204
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:32,610
Yeah.

1205
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:32,630
Yeah.

1206
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,650
Yeah.

1207
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:32,670
Yeah.

1208
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,130
Because as were you, you're in a place to talk about it.

1209
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:38,510
Yeah.

1210
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:41,849
And try and have the discussion and try and have the debate.

1211
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,110
Still, it still wasn't easy, was it?

1212
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,989
But I think that that's, that's, that's all we've got.

1213
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:51,690
We have to be grateful that our media is free and it's open and none of us are censored.

1214
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,550
So that's, you know, there's law.

1215
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,170
We've got to be concerned with law, but that's not being censored.

1216
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,050
Well, maybe not quite.

1217
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:01,670
I mean, when you're seeing, and, and take this, and I mean, this is necessarily what, but

1218
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,110
you know, when you see the president of the United States.

1219
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,309
Get taken off.

1220
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:05,730
Amazing.

1221
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,929
Tech platforms.

1222
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:11,230
Now, you know, quite openly, I, the hair stands on the back of my neck when I hear the former

1223
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:15,469
president Trump, but I find him very hard to, I have to turn off because I have such

1224
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:17,289
a reaction to a lot of the things he says.

1225
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:19,449
I almost find it impossible to listen.

1226
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:20,789
Some of them are, yeah.

1227
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,889
Get the Chinese planes to bomb the Russia.

1228
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,369
I mean, how do you get, like, get away with it?

1229
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:31,889
And I can sort of understand in some elements why he was, but that just happened in a, in

1230
00:55:31,889 --> 00:55:34,110
fact, I can really understand why he was banned from some of those platforms.

1231
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,889
Because of what was going on.

1232
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:40,590
But yeah, you said there's no censorship, but yeah, that's true.

1233
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,989
I, I, you're right.

1234
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:48,710
However, we also do need to, there is a higher order here and the higher order is protecting

1235
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,269
democracy, right?

1236
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:54,210
So if you're actually undermining our way of life, that is a problem.

1237
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,730
And if you've got the power to remove, in this case, an individual that's undermining

1238
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,070
democracy, that, that is actually, for me.

1239
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:02,809
Over and above.

1240
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:03,510
That's over and above.

1241
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:03,989
That's there.

1242
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:04,789
There's a higher order here.

1243
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:05,469
Yeah.

1244
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,210
And in the end, in the end, we need to, we, because everyone else can keep debating.

1245
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:14,630
We've just taken that voice out because that voice is actually, the dissent is so powerful

1246
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,429
that's been created.

1247
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,469
That it's dangerous and it needs to be censored.

1248
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,489
That's an interesting way to put it.

1249
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,409
And I understand that.

1250
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:25,489
We see great leaders in the 21st century now, Russ, really understand their communication

1251
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:26,989
and how they do it.

1252
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,289
You're an incredible communicator.

1253
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:29,130
You always have.

1254
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,369
What's been the way that you've gone about it?

1255
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:33,550
Well.

1256
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:41,309
You, I was going to say scarcity, but that's, it doesn't, it doesn't quite wash, does it?

1257
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,030
Oh my God.

1258
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:50,550
Uh, I, look, I, trying to stick, trying to stick to what I know, um, I think has been

1259
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,530
what I've done mostly.

1260
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:56,929
So I feel very comfortable talking about ideas and advertising and, you know, so the, my,

1261
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:02,329
initially I'd be on the radio with Virginia Trioli and I'd talk about ads, you know, and

1262
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:03,530
then Gruen, I'd talk about ads.

1263
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,489
Mojo did a documentary that's about ads.

1264
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,429
It's different what I'm doing now for sure, but maybe that's cause I've just got a bit

1265
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,309
more comfortable with media.

1266
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:15,909
So sticking to what I know though has been the, that's been the core.

1267
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:23,630
Um, I, I think I've, see, I wouldn't urge caution, uh, talking to the media.

1268
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:28,610
Um, and I think a lot of people, they're, they're cautious when speaking to the media.

1269
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,389
And I don't think that that's a good thing.

1270
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:33,449
Um, Americans aren't cautious.

1271
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,590
When talking to the media, they just go for it, right.

1272
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,909
And they, they very much see the media as just part of their big democratic world.

1273
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:43,909
That is the States, you know, there's everything's up for debate.

1274
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,170
Everything's up for argument and everyone's discussions is fair and reasonable, you know,

1275
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:54,170
to a point everyone, everyone's, everyone's, um, everyone's an open book and as a result,

1276
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,489
they all do really good media.

1277
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:55,909
Don't they?

1278
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,349
So I think it's hard.

1279
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,769
I think it's hard for Australians.

1280
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:00,650
I think, uh, we have a natural caution.

1281
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:03,309
Um, we don't want to show off for one.

1282
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:03,510
Yeah.

1283
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:08,489
Um, and for two, we're cautious about what, how we might get tripped up or we might say

1284
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:10,710
the wrong thing and, and then not sleep at night.

1285
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,909
You know, I think a lot of us are like that.

1286
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:13,909
I have been like that.

1287
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,150
I still am a bit like that.

1288
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:20,289
So, um, cautious and tried to stick to my knitting, but none of that makes any sense.

1289
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:21,650
I wasn't like that.

1290
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,650
I'm more like that now.

1291
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,650
Right.

1292
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:28,630
I think the, the sort of cancel culture part, I think is a real, a real thing and you can't

1293
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,690
actually say, sorry, you can't make a mistake.

1294
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,409
You can't have slipped up.

1295
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,190
And because, you know, more than you're in front of the microphone, the odds are just

1296
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,690
going to say, you're going to get something out there that you didn't mean to, but you

1297
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,949
haven't got that luxury anymore.

1298
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:45,349
I mean, 15 years ago you could be looser, you know, and I think it was healthier because,

1299
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:49,449
you know, you want to hear people as close to their real self and not guarded.

1300
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:50,449
I'm not sure where.

1301
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:51,449
Yeah.

1302
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:52,449
I think that's true.

1303
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:56,989
And there is an issue in that Google, let's just say Google, but it's all digital.

1304
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:57,989
Doesn't forget.

1305
00:58:57,989 --> 00:58:58,989
Yeah.

1306
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:03,289
So, and I think that's, that is really, that's not good for any of us.

1307
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:07,690
Um, you know, maybe it's not good for you or I, because we're talking and this is, you

1308
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:11,789
know, it's a lot of what we do is public, but for people that are deeply private, it's

1309
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:16,050
not good for them either because, you know, you might Google that particularly private

1310
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,530
person and discover seven years ago, something happened that, you know, wasn't good.

1311
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,530
It's, it's.

1312
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:24,309
You've taken, been taken out of context as well and, you know, an imbalance version of

1313
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:25,309
what happened as well.

1314
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:26,309
Yeah.

1315
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:27,309
I don't, I don't like that.

1316
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:30,150
I, cause I think that's unfair on all of us cause all of us make mistakes.

1317
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,070
Of course we all, we all do.

1318
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,070
Um.

1319
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,909
There's a lovely piece of legislation in Europe called the right to be forgotten.

1320
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:43,070
And you can actually, you, you've got to go through a very, a very major process.

1321
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,949
So you can't be a naughty person and then say, I want to be forgotten.

1322
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:51,789
You got to be a fine, outstanding citizen and then go through the process of being forgotten.

1323
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,829
Getting your digital history cleansed affectionately.

1324
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:54,829
Yeah.

1325
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:55,829
Yeah.

1326
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:56,969
And I'm, I'm going to go off the grid.

1327
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,389
You can, you can be officially off the grid.

1328
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:00,389
Yeah.

1329
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,670
Which who knows?

1330
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,670
That might happen.

1331
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,789
Uh, that might become more prevalent.

1332
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:13,349
I do think there needs to be a, a rebalance with regard to the big tech behemoth businesses

1333
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,789
and all of us individuals, cause us individuals provide them with the data that they make

1334
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:17,789
the money.

1335
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:18,789
Right.

1336
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,789
So there isn't, there isn't a balance at the moment.

1337
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:23,110
I could talk more about what should happen there.

1338
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,110
Should I?

1339
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,630
Well, you know what I was thinking, Russell, I was, my mind was going back to Shane Warne

1340
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:31,030
again and I was thinking why we love Warne so much is that he owned all of his history

1341
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,429
and we loved him for it.

1342
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:36,329
And I think as we could see our own failings and our own mistakes in it, and that was a

1343
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:37,329
great celebration.

1344
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:42,309
You needed to be as charismatic as Warne and taking 700 test wickets probably gives you

1345
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,309
a bit of credit, Russ.

1346
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:44,309
It does.

1347
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:45,309
Not many did.

1348
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:48,730
So there's a book, there's a book that someone could write and it could be called media brave

1349
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,050
because he was media brave.

1350
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,050
All right.

1351
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,269
So he wasn't intimidated by what might happen as a result of a headline.

1352
01:00:56,269 --> 01:00:57,269
I don't think he was intimidated.

1353
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:01,429
He might've, he might've had sleepless nights, but I don't feel like I'd feel like he was

1354
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:02,429
brave.

1355
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:03,429
And I don't know.

1356
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,429
There's many.

1357
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:09,909
That's your next book, Russ, media brave, and you are an author of, uh, of great repute.

1358
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:12,190
So I encourage you to look up Russ's work.

1359
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:16,670
It's a, it's definitely worth the final dimension I want to ask you about is, uh, the idea of

1360
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:21,989
collaboration as being something leaders really seek out proactively now, how do you think

1361
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:23,050
about that?

1362
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,289
It's the new thing, isn't it?

1363
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:29,329
And maybe we've always tried to find partners that, that were, um, going to enhance our

1364
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:30,329
offer.

1365
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,230
You know, the old synergy one plus one equals three, right?

1366
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,829
So it's, it's not new.

1367
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:39,590
The, the notion of collaboration cooperation, what I think is new is actually trying to

1368
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:45,090
seek out the collaborate or collaborations that are out of the box.

1369
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,769
So unexpected collaborations.

1370
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,670
I think that's where it's getting very interesting.

1371
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:56,909
So in an advertising context, when Crocs does a collaboration with KFC, that's really interesting.

1372
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:57,909
Yeah.

1373
01:01:57,909 --> 01:02:00,869
Or when North face does a collaboration with Gucci.

1374
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:01,869
That's really interesting.

1375
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:08,329
So if you, if you sort of put Gucci brand extreme left, they should be collaborating

1376
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:10,110
with someone who's extreme, right?

1377
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,110
Yeah.

1378
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:16,369
So thinking really beyond expectation for collaboration, that's where you're going to

1379
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:18,269
find something really interesting.

1380
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:23,909
So that's sort of, I think the new, the new way to think about it, not, not the obvious

1381
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,650
partnership version.

1382
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,590
Which is a brilliant, um, not surprised for us, your brain's going there and it comes

1383
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,469
back to your love of diversity.

1384
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:31,469
Doesn't it?

1385
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:32,070
Yeah.

1386
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,630
So that in people, you know, often groups get together that look a bit the same, sound

1387
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,929
a bit the same, feel a bit the same, and we're moving the same circles.

1388
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:44,050
When you bring the positive collisions together from unlikely sources in different areas,

1389
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:47,710
you know, we're saying that in, in the work we're doing has been brilliant.

1390
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,710
Right.

1391
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,349
You know, why can't someone who conducts an orchestra have a big influence on a senior

1392
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:53,349
sporting coach?

1393
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,349
How good is that?

1394
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:55,349
I'm sure they can.

1395
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:57,710
And that, that doesn't necessarily look like it should match up.

1396
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:58,710
I love that.

1397
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,710
It's happening, you know, and it's happening in such a powerful way.

1398
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,710
Yeah.

1399
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,949
It's happening in such a powerful way.

1400
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:05,949
Creative brains like yours overlapping into different areas is, is, is fascinating.

1401
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,469
Two final questions for us, and I've loved, I could spend hours with you as always, but,

1402
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:15,780
uh, the final two questions, who, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1403
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:25,039
Oh, there's, oh, you can edit out this pause.

1404
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,460
We're keeping this pause in for sure, Russ.

1405
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,460
I love the thing.

1406
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,460
There's a lot.

1407
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,460
There's a lot.

1408
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,460
I, I, I really admired, um, obviously I'm not a big fan of the, um, the, um, the, the,

1409
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,460
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1410
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,460
the, the, the responsibility.

1411
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,460
I, um, obviously I admire Jim.

1412
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,699
I really did admire Jim.

1413
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:39,699
Great Jim Steines, though.

1414
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:43,079
He, He I, I genuinely did because he came into

1415
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,840
a boardroom totally naive.

1416
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,920
Like, really, he had no idea how to run a board meeting to be the, the president.

1417
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:57,320
And yet he was able to get in a powerful group of people who then all genuinely collaborated

1418
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,480
and he found a way to lead and was outstanding.

1419
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,900
I mean, I, I sort of the Jim Steines era, there's pre and post cancer.

1420
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,099
Yeah.

1421
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,920
cancer is the truth of it. Pre-cancer, just incredible. And then

1422
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,000
it got tough, clearly, after that. There's a

1423
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,500
fellow called Hamish McLennan, who I've worked with a lot. He's now

1424
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,599
the chair of Magellan, for goodness sake. He's an ad guy.

1425
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,960
How did you do that, Hamish? Unbelievable. Ran Channel

1426
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,039
10 in your era there. So I reported to him at 10. And when I was the regional

1427
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,039
CEO of Y&R, he was the global CEO of Y&R. And he

1428
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,719
is someone that just—he

1429
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,079
really knows how to make stuff happen. He's got a powerful way just to

1430
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:44,800
get stuff done. So I always admired that, because

1431
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,019
I don't lead like that. So there was a degree of, geez, that's

1432
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:52,699
pretty impressive, and I don't think I'd be able to do it. So there was a bit of admiration

1433
01:04:52,699 --> 01:04:56,920
off the back of it. I've talked about Luke before,

1434
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,519
no question. He is a very good leader, for sure. Luke says, yeah.

1435
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:03,019
Ted Horton is a terrific leader. He's one of the

1436
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:05,179
great ad guys in Australia.

1437
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:08,840
Just recently turned 70, still runs an agency

1438
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,480
with employing a lot of people.

1439
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:13,280
Does very, very, very well for himself.

1440
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:18,880
In the media world, you've got, you know,

1441
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,219
you've got Gingell, he's a terrific leader.

1442
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,559
I haven't seen him for a long time.

1443
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,619
I don't even know him.

1444
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:28,079
I haven't seen him, you know, watched him for a long time.

1445
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:28,800
I think he's on-

1446
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,360
Former CEO of Channel 9 for a long,

1447
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,840
lives in Byron Bay now, I think.

1448
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:32,360
Right.

1449
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,820
He's joined the pub game with great success.

1450
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,820
And then, you know, you've got footy club leaders.

1451
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,260
Of course, we've discussed Max.

1452
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,159
Jack Trengove was on his way to being a brilliant leader.

1453
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,219
He got injured and that was it, you know, terrible, did his foot.

1454
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:56,579
He would have been one of the great captains of an AFL club.

1455
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,320
He had all the qualities that you would want.

1456
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:01,260
So that's, you know, hello to Jack.

1457
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,579
Who else?

1458
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,239
Roos.

1459
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,059
Paul Roos, very good at being the king.

1460
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,079
You know, there's something about hierarchy,

1461
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:13,019
which actually does work as well, you know.

1462
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:16,260
Ultimately, you know, someone who sits on the throne

1463
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,199
and then everyone just lines up behind them.

1464
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:18,380
Yeah.

1465
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,659
He definitely did that at the Melbourne Footy Club.

1466
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,099
And, you know, and maybe it's a sport thing, Darce, I'm not sure,

1467
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:26,199
but you sort of do need to line up.

1468
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,500
You need to get everyone in line.

1469
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:29,019
If you're not lined up, then you're in a bit of trouble.

1470
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:29,300
Yeah.

1471
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,099
And he definitely got everyone lined up.

1472
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:31,139
Yeah.

1473
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:31,179
Yeah.

1474
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:31,219
Yeah.

1475
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:31,239
Yeah.

1476
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,460
He got everyone lined up, no question.

1477
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:35,000
Which reminds me of when I saw Ewan McKenzie.

1478
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:37,500
You know, Ewan McKenzie, a coach of rugby union.

1479
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:37,699
Yeah.

1480
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,559
I was at school with Ewan.

1481
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,059
And the day I was appointed to the Melbourne board,

1482
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,019
I saw him in the street.

1483
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:45,119
G'day, Ewan.

1484
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:48,059
And then, you know, what have you been up to, Ra?

1485
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:49,679
I said, well, today I've had a great day today.

1486
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,320
You know, joined the Melbourne Footy Club board.

1487
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,679
And he just says, mate, there's only one thing that matters.

1488
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:57,320
You've got to have absolute alignment from the president to the CEO

1489
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,039
to the coach to the captain of the team.

1490
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,539
If you don't have that, you're cactus.

1491
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,280
Well, it's pretty true.

1492
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,420
Never a truer word spoken, Russ.

1493
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,000
And I had that said to me when I was captain of the Bulldogs.

1494
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:09,840
I had great info.

1495
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,599
I'm sure you won't mind.

1496
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:10,760
He was the president.

1497
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,940
At that time, it was, I think, David Smorgon was still in the chair.

1498
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,380
Yes, lovely fella.

1499
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:17,400
And Campbell Rose was the CEO.

1500
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:17,719
Yep.

1501
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,539
Peter Rowe was.

1502
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:19,579
We had some challenges.

1503
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,599
We had some real challenges.

1504
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,380
And I was probably getting frustrated,

1505
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,099
wanting to try and solve things that weren't really in my capacity.

1506
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,179
And the great Barry Richardson was an advisor to the,

1507
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:30,519
the coach.

1508
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:31,179
He was the coach at the time.

1509
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,340
He said, he said, listen, you know,

1510
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,239
you need that sort of alignment in every area and it's not there.

1511
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,440
And so you're going to do your heading and you need to focus on what you can

1512
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:41,820
control.

1513
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,360
And it really resonated with me because it felt selfish.

1514
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,400
It felt like, hey, I want us to be successful.

1515
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:49,360
We need to try and, you know, and he, he was just, you know,

1516
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,019
he played in premierships, been a president of premierships,

1517
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,260
coached premierships.

1518
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,380
I think he's the only person in the industry that's ever done that.

1519
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,159
So there was some wise words and, and, um.

1520
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:58,659
That alignment, right?

1521
01:07:58,739 --> 01:07:59,039
Yeah.

1522
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,239
And it's, you know,

1523
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:00,880
you look at Richmond,

1524
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:03,219
Richmond had brilliant alignment the last few years.

1525
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:04,280
I'm sure they will again,

1526
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,239
or I'm sure they haven't lost that alignment and clearly Footscray,

1527
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,280
Bulldogs has got great alignment, Melbourne Footy Club,

1528
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:10,860
great alignment.

1529
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,179
Everyone's saying that Essendon's now got that great alignment and it does

1530
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,939
sound really obvious, but it is, as you know,

1531
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,560
and as I've experienced in darker times, it's really hard to do.

1532
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:22,800
Without it, you're no chance.

1533
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:25,140
With it, it's still incredibly hard, isn't it?

1534
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,800
In a competitive industry like this.

1535
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,220
Final question in the, in the spirit of collaboration,

1536
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,119
uh,

1537
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:33,479
Russ, if you could collaborate with one person on the planet,

1538
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,399
it could be in any area of your life.

1539
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,800
Is there a name that, that springs to mind?

1540
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,079
Well, he's no longer alive.

1541
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:44,659
Um, so that's a pity, but Picasso's a big, I'm a big, really?

1542
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:45,180
Yeah.

1543
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:50,720
I, I find him fascinating, genuinely fascinating.

1544
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,539
Um, you know, he's criticized in his private life.

1545
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:59,520
I understand that, but his, his creativity was absolutely

1546
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,060
extraordinary.

1547
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:05,760
Like he would make, you know, many pieces of art every single day.

1548
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:11,560
Um, and it would of course get to the point where he'd have a meal and he would just paint

1549
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,800
a fish on the plate and that paid for his meal.

1550
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
So, you know,

1551
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:22,359
So it was without ever knows Picasso, but I'm not a student far from it, but so was

1552
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:29,199
he as big when it was alive and Kelly post that he's become, you know, he was, he was

1553
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,100
commercially at his time.

1554
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,100
Six.

1555
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah.

1556
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,100
So hugely successful as an artist and I like working with creative people.

1557
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,100
Yeah.

1558
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,439
So, um, so the idea that, you know, being the idea of working with, you know, the 20th

1559
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,199
century's graders, you know, that's, that's what immediately came to mind.

1560
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,500
But I love how you've gone there and his personal life.

1561
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,500
What was so.

1562
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,220
Well, he was sort of, he, he wasn't great.

1563
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:59,539
He had women in his life, but he could be very cruel and, um, he was known to be very

1564
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:00,539
cruel.

1565
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:04,859
So that of course, you know, there's, that's not a great, that's not a tick in the right

1566
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:05,859
box there.

1567
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:13,479
Um, he, he, you know, he sort of, he sort of, he'd change around a fair bit.

1568
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:17,720
He'd get himself a new partner quite often, you know, and at the time, I don't know whether

1569
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,020
that was seen as a good or bad, but you know, he could be cruel.

1570
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,539
I think that's probably the best summary.

1571
01:10:22,539 --> 01:10:26,539
Um, he, he, he lived a sort of a, what do you say?

1572
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:29,539
I'd like to leave a peasant's existence and be very rich.

1573
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:30,539
Yeah.

1574
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:31,539
Which is basically what he did.

1575
01:10:31,539 --> 01:10:36,939
Um, you know, he was in bare feet, shorts and a t-shirt, but was really rich off the

1576
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:39,039
back of just being a brilliant artist.

1577
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:44,140
Russ, uh, I'm always inspired by being around you and your creativity and, uh, your positive

1578
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,140
energy.
