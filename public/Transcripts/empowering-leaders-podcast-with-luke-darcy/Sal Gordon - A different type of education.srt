1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,369
Well, this week is a really special episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast for me.

2
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm out of the studio and lucky enough to be in beautiful Bali talking to the principal

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,010
and head of teaching and learning at the famous green school in Bali, Sal Gordon.

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,929
The episode was recorded at the health retreat Sukhavati Bali.

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,469
You can check it out at Sukhavati Bali, spelt S-U-K-H-A-V-A-T-I, bali.com.

6
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,009
I'm fortunate enough to be one of the co-founders 11 years ago of this Butu Gay Vedic Health

7
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:39,450
Retreat.

8
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,109
The beautiful staff and people at Sukhavati Bali are so excited to be back open again

9
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:47,649
after a couple of years of the challenges of the pandemic.

10
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,929
It's a fantastic place to look after your health, all about preventative health and

11
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,170
the programs I couldn't speak more highly of.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,710
It's been a great pleasure to be part of that.

13
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,530
So check out Sukhavati Bali and I love the opportunity to spend some time there and have

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,770
breakfast with Sal Gordon.

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,369
Sal Gordon, one of...

16
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:07,530
The great revolutionary educators in the 21st century.

17
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,250
Sal and the school are striving to champion the new model of education, one that nurtures

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,049
students and gives them agency in their own lives and their learning.

19
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,609
Education and changing our traditional thinking about the way we approach teaching our kids

20
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,609
is an incredibly meaningful conversation for me.

21
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,150
And this type of open and progressive communication is something that I love to explore in my

22
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,590
business, Alita, which was co-founded with my great friend, Matt Wadowitz.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,969
It's a place where leaders can collaborate and learn from one another and have conversations

24
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,230
they probably can't have elsewhere.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,290
And we have had the great privilege of working with remarkable people around the globe, including

26
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,409
Mike Dunlap, the assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, Eddie Jones, the head coach of English

27
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,890
rugby, Andy Lee from Hamish and Andy, just to name a few.

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,549
It's something you can be part of as well.

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,090
And you don't have to be a world-leading comedian or a head coach to be part of Alita Connect.

30
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,090
Whatever you do, we all...

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,870
We value and love the idea of bringing what you have in your environment to Alita.

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,229
And you can find out more about it.

33
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,669
Go to alitacollective.com.

34
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,150
Encourage you to check out the signature Alita Connect program, which is talking about to

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,330
understand how people like Sal Gordon from the Green School World Leading Educator are

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,710
collaborating and leading and learning in their world.

37
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:37,060
Sal Gordon is the head of learning and principal of the famous Green School in Bali.

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,460
The Green School's mission is to create a global community of learners, making our world

39
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,060
sustainable.

40
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,680
The Green School Bali has supported a global movement in education with schools opening

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
in New Zealand, South Africa, and Tulum, Mexico.

42
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:55,000
The Green School's living curriculum educates for sustainability through community-integrated

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,419
entrepreneurial learning in a natural environment.

44
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,479
They strive to champion a new model of education that nurtures the whole child, giving them

45
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,979
agency in their own lives and learning so they can thrive with purpose in our ever-changing

46
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:07,400
world.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Sal Gordon, as the principal of the Green School, is a self-described education revolution.

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,099
Sal, it's great to be with you in Bali today.

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,639
Yeah, thanks very much, Luke.

50
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,919
Lots of people might know me as Bill Gordon.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,360
You know, it's got a family history of craziness with names.

52
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,580
So, knowing that there's some people in Australia might be listening to this, it's Bill Gordon

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,259
and Sal Gordon all at once.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,599
So, you grew up in country Victoria, correct?

55
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,560
And you were educated in South Australia?

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah, I was born in Nill, schooled in Caniva, and then moved to Adelaide, Pulteney Grammar

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,300
for the majority of high school.

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
And then a university degree there, too.

59
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,599
I want to talk about your tenure gap year in a moment, but it's extra special for me

60
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,979
today being here with you.

61
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,159
And I'm sitting with you at a place called Sukavati Bali, which has been fortunate enough

62
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,039
to open 11 years ago and so connected to the community here.

63
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,699
Our family's been so lucky to enjoy the beauty of the Balinese people and to have a place

64
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,780
of health and rejuvenation, to see it back open again.

65
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:09,560
It's been a tough time around the world, but you've lived through this in Bali.

66
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,300
Can I first ask you about how the Bali people have gone?

67
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,779
One of the most special things about the Balinese, I think, is their sense of community

68
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,339
and family.

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,879
Definitely very difficult times financially when you take away tourism, which is the majority

70
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,139
of the income for most of the families.

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,819
Really tough time for them, but in a way, it provided an opportunity for them to demonstrate

72
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,220
who they really are in terms of looking after each other, looking after the community, looking

73
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,000
after their family.

74
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,879
It's different when you're in Australia.

75
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,279
Yeah.

76
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,300
Yeah.

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,319
Yeah.

78
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:49,199
You're sort of living in, you're fenced in little sort of house in the suburbs to understand

79
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,100
that sort of communities can be completely different models.

80
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:58,000
And it was difficult for the Balinese, but they didn't look like it was that difficult

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,839
for them because they just look after each other.

82
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,660
So loving and caring and sharing.

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,139
Life just went on for them.

84
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,519
They have a sense of a greater good and that's family and community.

85
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:09,819
It's beautiful to watch.

86
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,800
It was beautiful too without the traffic.

87
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,019
I can imagine the island would have been incredible.

88
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:15,680
Oh, it's paradise.

89
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah.

90
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,240
Absolutely paradise.

91
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,620
Yeah.

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,040
Has it returned quickly?

93
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,740
Very quickly.

94
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,839
Like a switch.

95
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,139
And possibly with probably more people here in terms of tourists than previous because

96
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,000
I think everyone's been waiting two and a half years to go on their holiday and they've

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,920
all just come back at once.

98
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,800
So the island has inundated.

99
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,339
It's got really, really busy really quickly.

100
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,839
So it's a totally different country, different island.

101
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,139
Yeah.

102
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,579
Yeah.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,779
We always feel so fortunate.

104
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,959
We always feel so fortunate when you spend some time here and to sit here at Sukavati

105
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,339
and be so connected to our local community here and just to see the nature.

106
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,759
And as you said, the way they support each other, we were checking in right throughout

107
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,300
the lockdown period.

108
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,279
It's like, you know, how much rice and vegetables can I eat was the answer that came back.

109
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,360
We're going to be fine.

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,180
So it's a powerful message.

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,379
You learn a lot every time you're here.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeah, totally.

113
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,779
Now I'm fascinated by your story, Sal.

114
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,639
As you said, you educated a private school, went to university.

115
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,720
But at the end of that, you know,

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,259
reading some of your backstory in preparation for this,

117
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,139
you felt like you weren't really adept at coping in the real world.

118
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,720
And you went on a gap year that turned into a gap decade,

119
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,459
gave yourself a whole heap of life experiences.

120
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:26,300
It's a condensed version of a big chapter of your life.

121
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,639
But can you describe how that experience brought you back to being an education revolutionary?

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,319
I suppose I had a mantra that was learn more.

123
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,339
As soon as I got out of university, I was planning to get into a postgrad medical course.

124
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:41,660
I wanted to...

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,920
I wanted to be like the next, you know, development world doctor.

126
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,980
I wanted to make a difference somehow.

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,439
But I also realised that my education had given me probably a couple of skills.

128
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,060
One is sort of how I learnt.

129
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,399
And it also just give me a couple of numbers on a piece of paper.

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,420
Going through all of that education, you know, private school education, then university,

131
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,399
it's taxing it for a while and putting myself four years of more of it.

132
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,279
I was like, I need it.

133
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,680
I need a chance.

134
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,699
Yeah.

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,459
I need to get out in the real world.

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,939
So I did.

137
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,040
I moved to India and worked with a health and development organisation there.

138
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,420
But as soon as I was sort of like, you know, out in the real world,

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,699
I realised that all of that education I'd been given hadn't really taught me anything.

140
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,759
It's funny to say that.

141
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,779
I felt really sort of, yeah, ill-equipped to cope.

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,259
I didn't think that skills had been something that I'd been taught.

143
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,540
The only skills I'd learnt, I'd sort of learnt on my own.

144
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,680
And I didn't think values were...

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,500
I didn't think values were anything that had been part of my education.

146
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,519
They were part of my upbringing from my family.

147
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,680
But, you know, when you get out in the real world and you realise that this certificate

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,779
that you've got is basically pointless and is not going to help you solve problems or

149
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,779
communicate or collaborate or think critically, it's not going to help you adapt.

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,980
It's not going to be able to help you think empathetically or with equity or act with integrity.

151
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,019
When you realise all these things that you're missing, you're like, well, okay, it's time

152
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,459
to give yourself a bit of an education.

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,319
And so, yeah, 10 years.

154
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,040
I spent jumping around the world and upskilling myself, learning with that mantra of learn

155
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,819
more, learn more, whether it be a language, a culture, people, places, jobs, different

156
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,139
jobs.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,139
I really like sort of like getting a great job or, well, probably an ordinary job, starting

158
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,279
at the bottom, learning, learning, learning and climbing way up and then six months later

159
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,259
going, well, that's enough for me.

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,519
I think I've learnt everything here.

161
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,220
I've got a supervisor, a managerial role.

162
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm out of here and I'll go travelling again.

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,440
So, the next step, I'd have to start at the bottom again.

164
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,179
It taught me a lot about probably what leadership is.

165
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,639
It taught me a lot of what real life learning needed to be and how that could look in a

166
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:52,919
school.

167
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,840
And then, you know, there was a time when you get married and you're starting to have

168
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,200
a family.

169
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,779
You're like, well, you know, what am I going to do for a job, a real job?

170
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,639
And I realised that I'd just been teaching and learning for 10 years all around the world.

171
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,820
And so, it was quite easy for me to jump into education.

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,779
I was a teacher.

173
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:11,700
And I was a learner.

174
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,399
I was really passionate about maths and science as well.

175
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,320
I saw them as explanations of life and of magic that this planet holds.

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,539
And so, yeah, I just got my degree at Melbourne Uni and jumped into education pretty easily.

177
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,919
And you ended up in a school in Orbost.

178
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, I love Orbost Secondary College.

179
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Incredible, isn't it?

180
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,179
That, you know, your life took you on that trajectory and you started integrating sustainability

181
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,659
through the curriculum, you know, in a meaningful way.

182
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,759
But you felt, from what I read, that you've always felt you're bumping your head against the wall.

183
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:41,480
You've always felt you're bumping your head against that system.

184
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,200
And the TED Talk from the founders of the Green School in Bali, that inspired you.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,980
It was the thing that got me.

186
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,320
Yeah.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,279
That's the thing that got me.

188
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,519
I wanted education to be different for my kids.

189
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,299
I wanted it to be different for all children.

190
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,000
I saw the opportunity of education that it wasn't taking, an opportunity for it to be

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,399
more than just a place where you get an exam result, for a school to be a part of a community,

192
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,419
a centre of community.

193
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,399
A school that can be a place where students love learning.

194
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,779
Do something with their learning now, rather than just maybe later, or just for an exam.

195
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,980
I thought that schools really had this opportunity that they weren't taking at all.

196
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,139
I saw education in a time capsule for the last hundred years, while the rest of the

197
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,919
world changes and is still changing, you know, societal change, technological change, environmental

198
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,279
change, which we should be a lot more concerned about.

199
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,759
But schools, this education process that we put in place, you know, it's not going to change.

200
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,259
It's not going to change.

201
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:39,759
It's not going to change.

202
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,259
It's not going to change.

203
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:40,759
It's not going to change.

204
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,000
And the money that we put our kids through for 13 plus years hasn't changed.

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,539
I mean, what's the purpose of school, Luke?

206
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,519
Is it just to get a mark, or is it to make the world a better place?

207
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,519
Because I think it's to make the world a better place.

208
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,559
And that's, you know, why I love having this opportunity to chat to you.

209
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,059
And it's something we just had breakfast, you and I, my wife, Bec, and we've got four

210
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,100
kids and, you know, educating private schools back in Melbourne.

211
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,500
And we're happy and connected kids, but I think as parents, we generally have this feeling,

212
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,200
have we given them what we actually wanted to do?

213
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,159
with this lifelong love of learning?

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,200
And I think the answer's no.

215
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,279
In fact, I'm sure the answer's no because, as you said,

216
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,759
you look at every other part of your life,

217
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,980
everything's been disrupted apart from education.

218
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,940
And you're doing that here at the Green School in Bali.

219
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:27,120
You guys are the template for what it can look like.

220
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,639
That's the mission to try and then take that to the world?

221
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,639
100%.

222
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,259
We've had an opportunity.

223
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,399
And I see, you know, I'm never dissing any other schools

224
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,519
and other teachers.

225
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,000
I think teachers are superheroes.

226
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,840
And I think there are a lot of schools doing a lot of good things.

227
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,539
Big systems, traditional systems are bigger

228
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,980
and more difficult to change.

229
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,220
They're like big ocean liners.

230
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,759
If you want to change course, it takes a long time.

231
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,940
But I see change in them.

232
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,879
I see change in the IB curriculum, the NYP.

233
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,919
And I've seen some change in the Australian curriculum from afar.

234
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,399
But we had an opportunity to create a whole new model of school

235
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,500
without any limitation.

236
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,220
So when we thought what could school be,

237
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,500
we thought, well, it could be a place,

238
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,980
a place where a whole community comes together.

239
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,919
Okay, our school is a community of learners.

240
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,240
When we realised that you could learn much more at school

241
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,960
than just knowledge and, in fact, just pick up your phone

242
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,139
and find out any piece of information you want now,

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,159
that skills and values are much more important to be educating,

244
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,539
we just did them.

245
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,440
We just did it.

246
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,320
When we realised that you didn't have to go to a geography class,

247
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,879
a history class, a maths class and stuff,

248
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,299
you could actually teach around a theme,

249
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,460
base it on something environmental or societal,

250
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,500
like, you know, you could teach around a theme,

251
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,360
access to education or women's rights or the oceans

252
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,620
and teach a thematic integrated unit

253
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,740
that combines literature, arts, science, maths,

254
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,919
dance, if you want, rap it.

255
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,820
You can rap your exam out if you really like.

256
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,559
When you think, well, learning doesn't have to be like it's always been.

257
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,659
School doesn't have to be like it's always been.

258
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,679
You can be creative and do something really cool.

259
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,940
We took that opportunity.

260
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,460
And there's been hundreds of educators go through there.

261
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,039
We've got our own curriculum.

262
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,639
It's internationally accredited.

263
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,360
Kids still can do calculus and organic chemistry.

264
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,080
If they really want, they learn their times tables

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,700
and learn how to read and write in the primary school,

266
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,720
just like any other school.

267
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,039
But we've created other opportunities,

268
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,259
other types of learning experiences that are real world,

269
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,320
that kids love, that are connected to their passions.

270
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,620
And now we want to share it.

271
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:26,720
Like, we've created a model that works.

272
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,419
Our kids go to university all around the world.

273
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,039
Our kids transition back into their home schools

274
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,419
when they go back to their home countries afterwards.

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,899
This model works.

276
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,019
School can be different.

277
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:37,919
We've proven it.

278
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,039
And now we really want to share it as much as possible.

279
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,720
And it's a brilliant story to tell, a brilliant story of leadership

280
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,279
and you following that sense of what made you want to continue

281
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,480
your learning journey.

282
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,820
Can you just describe it?

283
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,320
You've created an environment out there that is just next level

284
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,860
in terms of being connected to nature.

285
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,080
There are no walls at the green school.

286
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,179
It's a thing of beauty, that's all.

287
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,639
Yeah, well, there's not a lot of visual prompts in podcasts.

288
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,860
So I highly recommend anyone that's listening to this

289
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,879
to jump on the website or jump on YouTube.

290
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,840
And have a look at some of the imagery.

291
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,960
It is on a massive, massive jungle campus

292
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,059
with a river running through it, the Ayung River,

293
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,259
the biggest river in Bali.

294
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,919
Its classrooms are all wall-less, innovatively,

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,740
sustainably designed bamboo buildings.

296
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,299
There's gardens, vegetable gardens, medicinal plants.

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,000
I think there's over 140 plants that we garden and eat.

298
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,820
It's got solar, hydro power.

299
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,059
We're basically completely off the grid.

300
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,919
We've got an innovation hub.

301
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,919
We've got animals all through the campus from ducks and pigs and cows

302
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,860
and chickens and Bali dogs and the occasional snake.

303
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,659
And I've seen a couple of monkeys there too.

304
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,919
Bamboo is really important to us.

305
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:51,779
It's fast-growing.

306
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,580
It's sustainable.

307
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,679
The place is magic.

308
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,460
It's a place where people come and they love their school.

309
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,659
So how many people out there think back about their time at school

310
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:01,940
and go, well, I love that place?

311
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,679
Well, people come to green school and grow a love for a school

312
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,840
and grow a love for learning.

313
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,019
It's a beautiful place.

314
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,679
It's innovative.

315
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,419
It's creative.

316
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,120
You know, it is so cool that Dr. Jane Goodall comes to visit us

317
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,500
because she's heard of Green School Bali

318
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,620
or the Secretary General of the United Nations wants to come

319
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,379
and learn about how we've done education.

320
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,500
Alexandra Cousteau, Jacques Cousteau's granddaughter,

321
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,039
spent three months with us as an activist.

322
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,500
You know, we want education to be something like that,

323
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,940
not just a school where people drop their kids off to get a mark.

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
It should be a place that's special.

325
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,799
And Green School Bali is definitely a special place.

326
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,399
And you use the word fun a lot in all the stuff I hear.

327
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,799
It's fun.

328
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,399
I'm just talking to you over breakfast before.

329
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,220
You were saying on a Friday there could be a music band playing.

330
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,539
And how many people on campus?

331
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,039
You had over 500 students pre-COVID and coming back to that.

332
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,539
But tell me about a Friday at the Green School.

333
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,220
A Friday afternoon, Spirit Friday, we call it now.

334
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,879
We'll do a whole school assembly.

335
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,899
So if there was 530 kids before COVID, you double that with, you know,

336
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,840
everyone bringing at least one parent and then there'd be probably another 500,

337
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:10,179
sort of, guests and people just coming because we would.

338
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,259
We'd have a live band.

339
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,799
We'd have a big farmer's market.

340
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,779
We'd have the bar open.

341
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't tell anyone.

342
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,320
Couldn't really have a bar.

343
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,879
But, yeah, we think that learning can be something that we celebrate,

344
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,460
share and have fun together,

345
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,220
and that a school can be that place in a community.

346
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,519
I love what you were talking about before, Sal,

347
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,000
around teaching, you know, 21st century lifestyle skills,

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,539
you know, adaptability, creativity, critical thinking.

349
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
And then teaching values, as you said,

350
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,000
they're the things that really set you apart in life as you go forward.

351
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,279
And to think that they're not part of mainstream Korean curriculum,

352
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,600
how do you go about doing that and how important has that been?

353
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,340
Yeah, I think values-based learning is probably the foundation

354
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,519
of all of those things.

355
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:57,120
You know, you've probably got some historical people that you could think of

356
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,220
in the past that were great communicators, that were very intelligent,

357
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,600
but without a good value set at the bottom,

358
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,640
they end up people like Hitler, for example.

359
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,619
Very smart, good communicator.

360
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,480
Right, but so values are as important really as anything, you know,

361
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,559
and I learnt my values from my parents and my grandparents and I've, you know,

362
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,359
I was lucky, but values-based learning is really sort of a new nut to crack

363
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,079
for education and I think a lot about it.

364
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,240
I've designed a whole way of thinking about values-based learning

365
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,940
where you provide an opportunity for someone to experience a value.

366
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,960
So, we have our early years to teach the community peace.

367
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,460
Here's a good one.

368
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:36,839
I just thought of it.

369
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,440
They do a peace parade.

370
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,779
So, our kindergarten students and our pre-K, they learn a few songs about peace

371
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:46,200
and they build certain, make some little gifts and things like that

372
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,279
and then they tour the school, like a lap of the school,

373
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,240
singing with a bit of a band that follows them and they bring peace to all

374
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,039
of the community around the school, end up in the high school.

375
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,400
We have a big party in that sort of high school area.

376
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,400
So, you provide an opportunity for someone to experience the value

377
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,559
and then a big part of it is reflective at the end of it,

378
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,799
where you ask specific questions and you prompt people to think about what did it feel

379
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,420
like to experience that value, you know.

380
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,339
What did it feel like to experience peace?

381
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,539
And then, you ask, what do you think other people felt like to experience that?

382
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,700
And then, you ask, well, how in the future could you create that same sort of experience?

383
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,140
And you're actually learning a value.

384
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,579
Values based learning isn't something that you can read about.

385
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,940
You can't learn empathy by reading about it.

386
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
You've got to practice it.

387
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
So, again, you think about it, provide an opportunity for someone to experience.

388
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,200
Thank you, Jack.

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,400
Thanks, Zach.

390
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,539
Thanks, Jules.

391
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,900
experience empathy and then do a reflective cycle on it. And you're building empathy because you

392
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,339
can't get a hundred percent on empathy. You can't, you know, sometimes I probably should be more

393
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:50,880
responsible, you know, on a Friday night, you know, playing pool with my friends. I probably

394
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,559
should be a little bit more responsible. So you can't, you know, you're never a hundred percent

395
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,059
perfect with your values, but you can always be learning them and you can always input values into

396
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:06,119
the learning program. And if you're not receiving empathy on the home front to be able to go to a

397
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,619
place where you spend that amount of time, as you said, over 13 years, you think the amount of time

398
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:15,339
we spend at school to not at least experience that, understand what it's like and to maybe

399
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:20,319
share that with equity, community, trust, responsibility, you know, the world would be

400
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,279
a different place if values were a part of school. And you're intimately integrated in the community

401
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,460
here in Bali. And you're telling me that there are over 30 scholarships for local academic.

402
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:35,000
There's some of your favorite stories of leadership you were telling me. Yeah. You know, well,

403
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,099
sitting here on the,

404
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,920
on the drive here, I was thinking, you know, I wonder if Luke's going to ask me what's my

405
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,880
definition or who's my favorite leader. And I thought, well, actually some of my favorite

406
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,180
leaders are our local scholars. There's, we do have a, an amazing school, but we don't want to

407
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,119
just lock it away in an international school bubble. So our scholar program's really big.

408
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,880
There's 32 this year that are just local Balinese. They can't, couldn't afford, you know, we're in

409
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,359
international school. It costs money to come here. Couldn't normally afford to. They provide us

410
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,640
an instant connection with the local community. And there's some of, yeah, those students, I'd say

411
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,700
Guste. Guste's in grade 11 now. He's created his own stair-step electricity generating system.

412
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:27,079
So that, you know, everywhere you walk is going to create power, electricity. Another, another

413
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,619
awesome leader, Dipta, is, he's gone all around Bali, developed a really cheap, easy water

414
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,960
filtration system and is digging recharge wells.

415
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,119
Another one of their friends, Terta, another Bali scholar student. She's really into women's

416
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,480
empowerment. And, and so she's developed the whole women's empowerment program that she's going

417
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,880
around the world, growing around Bali and, and upskilling and uplifting, empowering the women

418
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,019
in Bali. We've also got people like Melati Witson and her sister. They started the Bye Bye Plastic

419
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,839
Bags movement. She's well-famous, TED Talk, thousand millions of views. She and her sister

420
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,099
started the movement that banned single-use plastic bags. She's also a member of the

421
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:15,599
bags in bali um now like un speaker clover hogan an alumni she's um started a company called forces

422
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:21,660
of nature and is going into and lectures now at oxford and cambridge and at the un around

423
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,799
ecophilia and building a connection with nature so you can build a different model of school you

424
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,599
can also send kids off to a medical degree if you really want but you can't it's not really the the

425
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,839
answer for everyone we're creating a model for change makers rather than change takers i reckon

426
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,579
when you and i went to school we were just taught how to take change and we've built we've built a

427
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:47,880
model that actually creates change makers they can make a change in the world you know to their

428
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,680
own life to their community and and we're seeing it now in a global global setting as it turns out

429
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,680
you and i are going to school you know not that far apart at a pretty similar time yeah and i was

430
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,500
thinking back as we were talking then about it was a really memorable teaching moment that i

431
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,579
had

432
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,720
at school and i'm searching for one and i'm not trying to be too critical to my kids as well

433
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,700
you know i'm not being too critical there of mainstream they've had a great experience and

434
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,119
great connection great friendships but you know when you talk about single-use plastics being

435
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,859
eradicated off the island of bali coming out of students in real time because of the education

436
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:25,859
they're getting and creating change makers in the world i mean that that seems to me what the the

437
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,660
whole principle the bali green school is doing is that is you know i can't think of us i can't

438
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,579
hear a story that 100 percent that i had a chance to do that i can't think of a story that i had a

439
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,740
school that was even close to that or memorable i can't tell you a lesson that i can think of which

440
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,099
me neither yeah sad isn't me neither yeah i think there's again i said before there's an opportunity

441
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:49,920
we send our kids to school for a long time and with education being in that time capsule we've

442
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,319
lost the purpose we've forgotten the point or even the opportunity of what that could be for a human

443
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,660
i think the world's probably suffering a little bit you look around societal challenge cultural

444
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,579
challenges they're not going to be the same as they were in the past and i think that's a big

445
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:02,859
part of that and i think that's a big part of that and i think that's a big part of that and i think

446
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:08,960
we see it all around the world in terms of race and religion um we see it now in our relationship

447
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,380
to the natural environment there's things that our generation and generations have done before

448
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:22,460
in terms of pollution uh is just one example that they're irreversible um and i think that's

449
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,559
sort of an end product of an education system that's ignored its potential its purpose

450
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,660
and for me education's got to be to make the world a better place

451
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,400
and so i suppose you're um you know very keen to point out that it's not utopia going to school

452
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,740
but you still have the same same issues and behavioral issues possibly even more

453
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,900
so you don't want to create this false pretext you know and what about kids with learning

454
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,059
difficulties and and how does how do you cope with the things that happen at school on a day-to-day

455
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,960
basis yeah we've got like 40 different nationalities so that's a lot of different cultural

456
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,640
norms and cultural norms and cultural norms and cultural norms and cultural norms and cultural norms

457
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,759
and cultural expectations that make a lot of that even more difficult um with it's a school that has

458
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:14,500
80 retention so 20 of the community changes every year and so when you're talking about a school

459
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,640
we're talking about a culture and it's a continual annual rebuild of a culture and recreation of a

460
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,160
culture and that culture is foundational um we we're not the perfect school and i don't think

461
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,000
one exists um we and because of those different changes in culture i think some of the challenges

462
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,519
are even more than other schools um you know learnings i think we're all unique learners in

463
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,200
a way and that's the way we try and think about it at green school we don't put you know the naughty

464
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,819
kids or the add kids uh the dyslexic kids in sort of a box and say well you just learn wrong they

465
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:54,700
just everyone learns differently and uniquely um we we try and provide as much learning support

466
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,099
structured based mostly through our early years kindy program and our primary school

467
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,480
and then the

468
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,859
nature of the program itself in middle school which allows for students to

469
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:10,319
explore their own passions to demonstrate their learning in the way that they want to learn rather

470
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,480
than do this learn this way and show me if learned it in a test sort of thing where you can actually

471
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,259
say well let's learn about the oceans um you can learn about it in any way you like and you can

472
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,700
demonstrate your learning back to me any way you like so you don't have to just sit and write an

473
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,079
essay about it you could actually do a rap if you like or paint a painting or do an infographic

474
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,039
there's so many ways to demonstrate learning that said

475
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,299
um you know there's a place like green school where you get everyone's focus you know and i

476
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,299
taught there for a long time too you get everyone's focus and you're right in and then the chicken

477
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:45,680
runs through the classroom or there's a snake even worse you know um there are no walls so

478
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,460
you you remember when you're at school and you're always just staring out the window well there is

479
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,720
no windows it's bang right there there's a garden and you just it's quite a difficult place um for

480
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
students that are challenged in terms of maintaining sort of concentration because everything's sort of happening all the time

481
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,119
yeah

482
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,460
so it's not the perfect school it's not the perfect school for everyone but there's parts of the model

483
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,539
that could be replicated um whether it's thematic learning or skill-based learning or values or

484
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,680
just the concept of a school being a community that you could do in a square room well that was

485
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,339
my question to you to say you know not everyone you know can build an oasis uh in all wood like

486
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:26,259
the green school we know that's not going to happen you know expansion has happened in in a

487
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:30,380
different way new zealand looks incredible and tulum mexico i mentioned off the top in south

488
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,640
africa as well but for these people it's not going to happen you know it's not going to happen

489
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:31,680
in a different way new zealand looks incredible and tulum mexico i mentioned off the top in south

490
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,700
africa as well but for these people it's not going to happen you know it's not going to happen

491
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,140
big ocean liners as you describe them that are hard to turn for a reason they and they're proud

492
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,700
institutions a lot of them and have great history and they've produced fine people over a long

493
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,539
period of time what what do they need to take out of of the the lessons of the green school in bali

494
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,740
i think yeah like some of the things we've talked about already i think um thinking more than just

495
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,720
knowledge-based learning systems uh skills and values are more important now like i said you

496
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,640
just look it up on your phone you know when have i ever used fourth grade and i've never used fourth grade

497
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,240
third's pi r cubed for the volume of a circle like when and if i did need i'd just you pick up

498
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,680
my phone and hit google you know hit google um so skills and values i think uh teaching real world

499
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,099
things teaching integrated real world things you can cover i taught i proved it in australia where

500
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:23,140
you can cover all of the learning outcomes for literacy maths and science for a term by teaching

501
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:30,059
about sustainability for example by teaching a unit about water um i think schools would be

502
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,640
better places and

503
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,720
places where people look back on in fondness uh not just for the school but with in terms of their

504
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,359
relationship with learning if they were probably more community-minded and were able to think of

505
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,759
themselves as centers of a community rather than just a place where parents drop their kids off

506
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,160
um it just any i think just that concept of uh student-centered learning is really important

507
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,640
you know we don't want to we i think education sometimes has the opposite effect to what it

508
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,579
what it's probably trying to do to get students to get back to school i think it's really important

509
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:01,640
i think education sometimes has the opposite effect to what it what it's probably trying to do to get

510
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,599
to do um you know if you go through school and you end up not loving learning um the the system's

511
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,940
failed the kid because life's a learning process as soon as you stop learning you die basically so

512
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,559
think about schools could just think about just igniting a natural love of learning why not

513
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:32,809
i love sitting down with different leaders from different backgrounds so seeing what leadership

514
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:36,690
looks like in different settings you know sitting here with you in bali today and your journey's

515
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,230
as unique as anyone's but it's a great story of leadership in my mind and and we see these

516
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,750
dimensions of leadership as being consistent with 21st century leaders like you and we think

517
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,589
self-leadership is one of the first dimensions where people who can have an impact like you are

518
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:56,450
i've got an acute sense of self-leadership does that make sense to you yeah totally i think there

519
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,869
was a time remember when i said um my mantra for a while was learn more as soon as i got into

520
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,670
education i wanted to do something with this opportunity and and found myself

521
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:13,109
wanting to move into leadership positions i changed that mantra mantra to be better and so i wanted to

522
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:18,309
do something more with that learning and to be better be better for my students be better for

523
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:24,390
a community be better for myself and how so then then you really sort of need to be self-aware so

524
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,890
be aware is one of our green school skills which is not really a normal uh life 21st century life

525
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,650
school but being aware and being aware of who you are and where you are and who you're with and

526
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,170
even

527
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,849
your relationship all of that and your potential impacts really important so i spend a fair bit of

528
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:49,170
time reflecting um day to day in a way of sort of how i can be better and not just be better for

529
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,789
myself but how can that be better for a greater good i suppose it's probably not the nicest way

530
00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:01,769
to say but how can how can i have a positive impact on other people on the environment and

531
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,650
maybe hopefully with people listening about education changing on a global system

532
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,049
that needs to change so when you have that mantra be better is that something that you know you've

533
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:14,789
written down is that something yeah it's something i've written down and i'm and it's where i start

534
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:20,930
you know i've got a great coach um dave hayes in sydney hey mate um great coach he keeps me

535
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:25,369
centered and keeps me level but it's something that i you know i start most of my reflective

536
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:30,289
practice with of you know because you're not perfect people aren't perfect i'm not perfect

537
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:36,589
i don't try to be i'm very normal i you say these things about leadership and i just sit here going

538
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,849
well really i'm not i don't know is that really me i just want to be better i suppose it's a great

539
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:47,529
thing to have and and you know a personal mantra and it's you sum up self-leadership in

540
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:52,369
such a brilliant way can i ask you about about the coach you mentioned your coach dave dave hayes

541
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,289
dave hayes i mean i love hearing people talk about you know the analogy for me if roger federer needs

542
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:02,930
to coach we're naive to think we don't need a coach so 100 so so how did you come across

543
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,529
the coaching yeah he's an ex green school family uh

544
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:12,190
parent um and i got to know him like personally as a friend and he was a parent i was a teacher

545
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:19,609
of his kids um so he had this he's got a unique insight into the place that i work and the type

546
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:24,529
of challenges and he's back in sydney now so we all got used to doing things online on zoom and

547
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:30,230
um i think with him the one of the best things about coaching with him is that sometimes i'm

548
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:36,509
not sure whether i'm coaching him or he's coaching me um which is really good i find that it's just

549
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:44,369
a really sort of mutual uh respect and relationship but yeah he challenges me where through times

550
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:51,410
probably to be better um it just gives me that different view and and probably a really well

551
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,529
informed view of the challenges or who i am and who i can be i love the accountability that isn't

552
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:00,289
it when you actually get on the phone to someone that identifies as your coach you've got to be

553
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:04,930
accountable to the things that you do don't you even in that it's pretty profound thing to have

554
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,650
in your answer on self-leadership you mentioned a

555
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,710
about be better and wanting to have a positive impact on others and we see that as a genuine

556
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,730
dimension leaders now they are really conscious about the impact they have on others can you

557
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,009
delve into that a bit more on a daily basis how you go about having a positive impact

558
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:25,410
i think sort of one of those you know if you look back if i look back or if i had to define

559
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:31,109
leadership um which comes through me and my mantra i think that you know things like being

560
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:36,650
inspiring and empowering and enabling you know if i ask myself how can i be

561
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,750
better for my teachers well i need i can be better at enabling them or empowering them or upskilling

562
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,769
them um i can be better at just sitting and listening i think listening is probably one

563
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,650
of my superpowers even though it doesn't sound like it in this you do you normally talk more

564
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:56,490
in this and i love it it's brilliant i think you know those things those leadership qualities that

565
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:02,150
um that you have to work on that some people find probably more natural than others um

566
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,509
that allow me to you know i don't think there's one

567
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:12,329
definition of a leader and i think leaders have even in my role here there are different

568
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:16,910
aspects of leadership i have to demonstrate all the time to different people into different

569
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:24,529
circumstances and situations but most of the time it's it's around i think care care and

570
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:30,589
demonstrating love love something that's sort of coming back thank god into the world um empathy

571
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:35,970
um in you know i think if you can tap into someone's passion

572
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,650
whether it's a person or a person's passion it's a person's passion it's a person's passion

573
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:42,130
it's a student or a teacher or a parent within your community you're being better at providing

574
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:49,250
a service for them to for them to be better as well um yeah and i see that uh in you having

575
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,970
breakfast and you know you turn to a beautiful pudu who made our breakfast this morning and

576
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,809
and you speak balinese and you speak another local dialect here as well so you talk about

577
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:06,049
lifelong learning 100 you've uh you embody that yourself and that obviously flows through isn't

578
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,750
we love debunking the idea of leadership as well so in the terms of just it doesn't need title

579
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,710
does it and you'd see that from your students it can come in all shapes and sizes as well

580
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:23,030
yeah totally i think like a lot of things in life whether it's leadership or respect i suppose the

581
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:30,190
language thing for me is the way that i can be better as a person that's living in in bali and

582
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,590
indonesia rather than saying i respect you i will learn your language and communicate with you and

583
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:42,469
it's hard you know i never learned a language um at school so you know it's not hasn't come easy

584
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:47,389
to me but i think all these things are action-based maybe that's sort of something that yeah that we

585
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,309
talk about you know that uh empathy isn't something that you talk about it's something

586
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:56,710
that you demonstrate um respect isn't something that you can you know say i respect you it's you

587
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,969
you've got to demonstrate the things you've got to show this and i think that's probably good

588
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:05,630
leadership as well you know you can try and inspire people but maybe the biggest inspiration is you

589
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:13,369
know you know or empowering people but you know it comes from within as well so i think a lot of

590
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:18,570
these things are not things that you can just talk about you've actually got to do it um yeah well

591
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,130
said um creating and sharing a vision is something we see all leaders are really conscious of as well

592
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,570
and you know we've heard about you as a self-proclaimed education revolutionary this

593
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,510
idea of wanting to disrupt the education for the better globally i mean how have you thought about

594
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,590
that and how do you go about sharing and creating that vision

595
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:42,449
yeah well this is this is part of my job sitting and and sharing what we've done and not what i've

596
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:48,730
done but what we've done as a community at green school um i honestly believe that education

597
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:56,530
is a change mechanism tool for a better future a more sustainable future not just an environmental

598
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:03,130
sustainable but talking holistic we're talking societies and well-being um there's a lot of

599
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,489
there's a there's a lot of problems around the place sorry

600
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,610
i'm not i'm definitely not a negative person either if you look at the relationship with the

601
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:16,170
environment we look at societal problems look at mental health mental health for for kids youth

602
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,389
nowadays it's just should be really really scary we've got to do something you know we don't have

603
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:27,829
another earth to move to we've got this beautiful amazing planet that um with this beautiful human

604
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:33,730
species that is sort of thinks it's conquered the planet it's got an amazing advancements in

605
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,630
technologies it's got so much going for it

606
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,170
for it but sorry it's going down the tube education can be something that changes that education needs

607
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,449
to be something that changes that if we're waiting for governments to change we're waiting for big

608
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:54,070
global corporations to make those changes for a sustainable future just keep waiting we've got an

609
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:59,570
opportunity uh i think schools and and teachers themselves are superheroes because of their love

610
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,630
of teaching and learning that's the change mechanism tool we need to activate and i'm

611
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,630
passionate so passionate about it i can move forward i can actually take it and i can change my world and so will you

612
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,570
for it but sorry it's going down the tube education can be something that changes that education needs to be

613
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,809
can't think of anything more exciting than education changing around the world if small

614
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:17,309
changes in big systems big changes wherever they can happen where we provide a learning opportunity

615
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:23,769
for the youth that moves them into the future as change makers not change takers that we can

616
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:28,489
adapt in the future because some of these environmental changes are permanent now and

617
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:33,130
we can't change what's going to happen we need to be resilient we need to be problem solvers

618
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,030
communicators creative thinkers critical we need to think critically a lot more and that's got to

619
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,110
come from a different type of education system if you're sitting around learning stuff from a book

620
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:48,969
and then regurgitating it in exam so that you get a score if that's all school is i'm sorry i'm not

621
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:54,050
going to be a part of it i want to change it it needs to change this planet our kids my kids and

622
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,590
their kids they need it they need education to change yeah it's a profound way to sum it up and

623
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,110
i love those stories you shared of your local leaders at your school

624
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,190
doing incredible things you know based on the education that you've given them at the green

625
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,630
school barley curiosity is a where we hear a lot of dimensional leadership so and i'm sure your

626
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,210
brain will go there and through curiosity we see so much learning and development can you tell us

627
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,650
about what that means to you yeah well i think it's a it's a handy tool to have rather than

628
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:30,190
to be questioning things or fearful of things to be curious about them you know i'm curious about

629
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,110
what happens when sea level

630
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:38,750
rise by a meter or i'm curious about what we do when the next black lives matter thing happens

631
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:45,309
i'm curious to how afl clubs respond to the historical racial problems that that have been

632
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:52,230
in cultures and footy club i'm curious about the potential of humans to to be better um yeah i

633
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:59,050
suppose and i think you know when you rephrase uh things into a state of or a state of mind of

634
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,110
curiosity you're opening yourselves up in a much more level-headed and open-minded way of thinking

635
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:10,030
and an honest way to to solve a problem or to to address the issue yeah curiosity is something i

636
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,750
my coach hey dave talks about a lot yeah i could tell that was going to resonate with you

637
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,409
communicating the clarity is something you do extremely well and something we see as a common

638
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:24,369
dimension of leadership you you tell your story you know really profound way if you've consciously

639
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,590
thought about that is it just somehow your communication and to get this message out

640
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,050
how have you gone about that i'm always in my favorite

641
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,949
teacher at school is my english teacher and i went on to you know do a science degree so

642
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:45,449
um two and two together and you get five sometimes um i've always had a love of literature and i've

643
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:51,449
written a lot i used to tell you write a diary i think for 20 years i wrote every day as a story

644
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:58,630
as a chapter of my life um i never consciously worked on um communication in fact it was the

645
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,010
thing that scared me the most becoming a principal of you know getting up and talking

646
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:09,090
to in front of 500 people or sitting there with a microphone in my face i've got the world's best

647
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,190
school prize on tuesday next week it'll be a keynote online but there'll be thousands of people

648
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:20,070
can we just pause there and say congratulations marine school bali is internationally um you know

649
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:25,250
up for an award to recognize you as the most sustainable school globally it's a environmental

650
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,690
action so world's best school for environmental action brilliant so i was scared about it but i

651
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,110
suppose that's something that where the be better came into it

652
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,170
as well um knowing that i had a belief in something and knowing that i had an opportunity to

653
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,130
share that belief and share what we're doing meant that i had to start thinking about how i

654
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,469
communicate and plus i'm communicating to at school to 40 different countries the americans

655
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:57,730
still need a translator for me sometimes um yeah i'm talking to you leslie um so you know it's

656
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,030
something that i had to work on you know i'm if i really want to have an impact or if i really

657
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:09,710
want to share what collectively my community is doing then yeah i've had to get better at it i don't

658
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,769
know if i'm getting any better at it i think you've uh you've got a pretty good handle on that

659
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:18,849
how you get your message out you're you know jumping off there for a minute again you're 42

660
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:25,570
different nations represented at the green school bali at a point in time so it's a melting pot

661
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:31,130
isn't it of international um community coming together yeah yeah and they all come to green

662
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,110
school well they come to bali

663
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:39,090
for the school so there's that added sort of expectation pressure um they haven't just moved

664
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,210
to bali and then shopped around for a school they've picked up their whole life um some of

665
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,769
them it's financially a stress as well because it's it's an international school it's probably

666
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:52,650
only half the school fees for anyone going to a private school in australia right now so

667
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,550
if you're thinking about a change anyone australia the gates are open bali's lovely

668
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,889
can people literally if they're listening i mean are you taking registrations we're growing quite

669
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:02,809
quickly um

670
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,710
and part of sort of you know what i consider is a really important part of the schools out the

671
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:13,309
culture you know that culture is defined by the people in it um and so we don't want to grow

672
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:18,570
exponentially we'll probably cap out in a few years at about 600 i think that's a magic number

673
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:25,050
yep um but yeah it's a challenge but it's also one of you know we've got a real global community

674
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:32,409
um from people all over the world including our host nation people here um the balinese and

675
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:40,630
it's it's quite a unique place um but also with quite you know serious challenges we've got

676
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,949
ukrainians and russians in the school we've got chinese and americans in the school we've got you

677
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:50,989
know it's it's it's it's a beautiful place and we're all coming together though you mentioned

678
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:56,130
the mission um at the start when you did the intro you know we define our school as being a community

679
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,869
of learners making our world sustainable and everyone that signs up it's it's um we have quite

680
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,630
a thorough admissions process you know you've got to be the right type of family you've got to

681
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:14,750
you know want to make us an effort or even step up in terms of your life uh living sustainably and

682
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:22,190
and sort of ethically empathetically in terms of a cultural being as well so you know it's a little

683
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,150
bit of a family fit rather than just sign up we want my kid to go here we would like to talk to

684
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,690
you too luke about who you are and what you want in life um because you're a part of our our

685
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,929
community that sort of thing

686
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,570
yeah it's brilliant uh the final dimension is uh we see leaders are really passionate about

687
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,110
collaboration now as a as a dimension of their leadership what you're doing is an incredible

688
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,590
collaboration how do you go about that and how do you think about collaboration

689
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:56,469
i think i've learned really quick that i'm not right all the time in fact um it's much better

690
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:01,769
to think just to lose that attachment to being right as a leader is really enlightening and

691
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:02,969
refreshing and i think when

692
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,730
other people that you're working with um who who used to think that they were working for you

693
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:14,010
but when they start to realize that you we're just working together and they realize that this person

694
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,210
that they thought they were working for isn't doesn't want to always be right um is the first

695
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:26,070
step of good collaboration um a collaboration of course you know you've got your baselines of you

696
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:32,989
know um establishing sort of alignment in alignment in in a vision or a mission or that end project of

697
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,650
what you're trying to to agree on it's pretty hard to collaborate when everyone's trying to

698
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:43,250
get to a different place and so that my role is probably more uh helping a group of people

699
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,070
sort of be aligned with where we want to get to what's what are we trying to create and then

700
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:54,449
knowing that i'm not always right in fact sometimes it feels like i'm the least intelligent

701
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:59,010
person in the room but that's the way i want it you know i want that person who's great at

702
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,090
mindfulness and it's got a degree in something else and i want that person who's

703
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:10,090
got their phd in another part pedagogical design um and i want another person who's

704
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,670
a learning theory expert in there and let me be the person to bring all the great minds together

705
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:20,230
and then we get the best result and that's good effective collaboration for me yeah i've heard

706
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,730
that a lot from the different leaders i've spoken to that this practice um you know spoke to john

707
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,530
birch and the legend of australia too recently and he was talking about walking into a room

708
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,050
and having the mindset that he knows nothing yeah i know nothing and then i can

709
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,349
be in the presence of wanting to learn straight away not i'm going to share with you how much i

710
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:42,250
do know and i think it's a profound way to think yeah yeah um who's been the greatest leader in

711
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:52,909
your life so personally i was always big global citizen big global historical leaders um were

712
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:57,349
always the people that i had posters on the walls i suppose is that what you're looking for you know

713
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:03,050
cliche you know it's it's gandhi i've spent a long time in india i thought the way

714
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:08,349
of his mind and the peaceful the degree of difficulty of what he was trying to do it's

715
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,730
nelson mandela it's it's probably really cliche you're probably expecting something

716
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:20,650
probably more innovative not at all um you know i learn most from my kids i suppose and so in a way

717
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,610
they're leading me in terms of my learning journey through life my own children and that might be the

718
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,090
different way of thinking about who are my favorite leaders well i love it i'll let you

719
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,110
immediately go to to and we get i love you know you didn't hesitate because

720
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,449
you you know you thought about i mean i had i had a dream the big poster martin luther on my wall for

721
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:44,230
you know five years i used to stare at it as a kid that's unique isn't it well not cliche it is it

722
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,769
it's inspiring because you've gone and taken your life in that direction of inspiring others so i

723
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:53,389
mean that's unusual for a kid though to have martin luther king growing up in country victoria and

724
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:57,250
then going to popney grammar in adelaide there wouldn't have been too many others where did that

725
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,909
come from is that from your family or just the sense of purpose about who you were yeah i don't

726
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:09,389
know you know born and raised on a farm good christian upbringing um i don't know my parents

727
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:16,369
allowed me to think differently and always sort of fostered just my passions um you know it was

728
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:19,449
kind of hard for them they send you away to school they're farmers they send you away to

729
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:24,550
pulteney they pay a lot of money i go do one uni degree and then pull out of doing a medical degree

730
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:29,690
and go travel around the world for 10 years um but they trusted me and they'd always i suppose

731
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,110
that trust trust is a really important thing isn't it that trust is a really important thing

732
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,750
and knowing that you know the passions that i had probably i don't know where that came from

733
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:44,190
because it was pretty monocultural sort of upbringing um but i believe that you know that

734
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,449
we could be better as a species as a person and i believe that we could probably all have a dream

735
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:54,889
and i was always allowed to follow it and you're living it every day living the dream it's

736
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:58,670
brilliant literally living the dream speaking about cliche mate that's uh might get a tattoo

737
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,090
of that one uh on the back of that we're obsessed with collaboration if you could

738
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,489
collaborate with anyone i mean clearly the green school barley and and or anything in your life

739
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:12,309
any passion of yours is there is there someone that springs to mind that you might want to

740
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:18,309
collaborate with you know i'm 49 now and i wouldn't mind jumping back into australia in a

741
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:23,309
couple years time um 10 years at green school i've got another year next year that'll be 11

742
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:29,650
and if i could get some i don't know who they are but if i think the education system's right

743
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,650
to change and if i could help and collaborate with some

744
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,349
some of our government i'd love to be out of some of the leading schools in there i think

745
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:44,030
education in australia could be a frontier of change around the world um i want to look after

746
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:50,590
my home backyard a little bit a bit more than i have um but yeah i think i've got this i these

747
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:56,650
ideas and and a model now that i could share that could really change and so if you know i don't

748
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:03,010
want to keep this this these ideas in on a little island in bali you know it'd be it'd be

749
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,710
amazing to try and change the australian education system the way that i've seen it change here

750
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,150
well there's a call out to uh to anyone who's uh who's listening and i think all of us who

751
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:21,449
you know care about our kids in the future want to see uh the values-based 21st century learning

752
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:27,710
community i mean i don't think anyone would see overlaying that more into us not a babysitting

753
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,150
environment not just chasing you know i've got this feeling sal that perhaps the world's going

754
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,110
to disrupt education and i think that's going to be a big part of the future of education

755
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,309
in reverse where universities now don't care anywhere near as much about all the big tech

756
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:42,030
companies around them i don't care at all about the score at the end so perhaps that's going to

757
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:48,210
say if you come back the other way you know maybe we do need to learn more about the sort of learning

758
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:53,530
that you're talking about it's not a big shift you can still you can still study calculus you

759
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:58,869
can still you know your primary kids still learn their times tables um they still learn spelling

760
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:02,750
and grammar and things like that there are things you could do i could do it overnight

761
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,110
to see if i could do it overnight and i think that's going to be a big shift in the future

762
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:08,989
some of the australian system and the world would be a better place and learners our students

763
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:12,789
would be happier and our parents would be happier and i think australia would be a better place

764
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:19,730
just from making some tweaks to a pretty archaic old system look back at our schools with uh with

765
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:25,489
that sense of fun and that sense of um you know respect uh would be a brilliant change um it's

766
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:29,969
been a great uh pleasure to spend some time you're right here in bali and i know you've got a busy

767
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:33,110
day straight back out to the green school yeah um look forward to catching up with you

768
