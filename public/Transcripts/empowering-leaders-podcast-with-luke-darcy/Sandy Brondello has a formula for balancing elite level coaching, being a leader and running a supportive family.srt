00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,929
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Australian basketball legend Sandy

2
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,529
Brondello from her Manhattan apartment overlooking the New York skyline, where she is the current

3
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,850
coach of the New York Liberty in the WNBA.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,730
You can hear Sandy talk about growing up in a sugar cane farm in Queensland and practicing

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,530
basketball for hours on end on a grass court with a backboard her dad had made for her,

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,949
handmade out of timber and painting it white.

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,649
An extraordinary story of her becoming one of the great shooters in women's basketball

8
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,090
history.

9
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,090
Sandy talks about the importance of teaching kids the fundamentals rather than overtraining

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,950
them, a great lesson to share.

11
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,409
Sandy also describes the loneliness of leadership and the great wisdom she's received from collaborating

12
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,329
in her Alita Connect group.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,369
Sandy's bespoke Alita Connect team includes Justin Lepich, the three-time Brisbane Premiership

14
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,570
legend and current assistant coach of the Collingwood Football Club, John Bertram, Australian

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,490
Hall of Fame legend.

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,049
And one of Australia's greatest ever sporting success stories, Darrell Franklin, who is

17
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,790
the current head of staff, chief of staff at the Green Bay Packers.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,409
Brad Fittler, rugby league legend from New South Wales, current state of origin coach

19
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,230
for New South Wales and an extraordinary person, Brad Fittler.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,209
Pat Clifton is part of that group as well, the assistant vice president of player health

21
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,170
and performance at the NBA.

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,310
And Sandy talks openly about how that shared opportunity to learn and to connect and to

23
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,469
collaborate has been incredibly powerful for her.

24
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,489
And she has an amazing amount of wisdom to share as well.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,709

Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and the team at Temper Australia, New Zealand.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,269
Temper, a mattress like no other.

33
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,049
And many of the best athletes around the world.

34
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,890
We choose to sleep in temper bedding.

35
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,950
We spend a third of our life asleep.

36
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,629
So investing in a temper bed and bedding is a positive decision that I promise you will

37
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,150
change your life for the good.

38
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,729
Sandy Rondello is Australian basketball royalty, representing Australia at four Summer Olympic

39
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,969
Games, winning a bronze and two silver medals, playing over 300 games for her country.

40
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,030
She's a member of the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame, was awarded the MVP in 1995

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,629
as the most valuable player in the Australian League.

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,629
And in 1999, her first season.

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,289
As a player in the WNBA in the United States, was good enough to be an all-star in her debut season.

44
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,569
She also spent 10 years playing in Germany, winning 10 straight national championships.

45
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,770
Her WNBA three-point percentage of .41 has her placed fourth all-time in the world's best league.

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,050
Sandy's coaching career post-retirement from playing has been another remarkable success story.

47
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,930
In 2014, coaching the Phoenix Mercury to a championship win, as well as being awarded

48
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,069
the coach of the year.

49
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,629
She's currently the head coach.

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,590
She's also the head coach of the New York Liberty and the head coach of the Australian

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,330
national team.

52
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,310
The Opal of Sandy, it's a pretty extraordinary life of success.

53
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,189
Thanks for joining me today.

54
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,150
Oh, it's great to be here with you.

55
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:26,030
You grew up the daughter of sugarcane farmers from Mackay in Queensland, Sandy, and you

56
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,569
stand five feet, seven inches tall, if I'm correct.

57
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,370
It's an unlikely story to be one of Australia's greatest ever basketballers.

58
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,250
Yeah, look, really, to be quite honest, some days I just have to pinch myself, you know,

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,229
where I came from and where I am now.

60
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,430
But, you know, I think.

61
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,090
I took the opportunity with two hands.

62
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,569
I worked extremely hard and, you know, I think my parents, you know, instilled that in me

63
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,629
from a very young age.

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,490
So, you know, I'm living the dream.

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,090
Sandy, I understand your dad built a grass court basketball hoop and you grew up playing

66
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,530
on grass of all things.

67
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,110
So where did the love of the sport of basketball come from out of that part of the world?

68
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,770
To be quite honest, it was by chance.

69
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,490
My sister started to play basketball with some of her friends.

70
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,509
And there was a new country basketball club starting up close to where I live because

71
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,790
my mum couldn't drive and my dad being a sugarcane farmer is quite busy during the, you know,

72
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,170
the crushing time.

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,410
And, you know, I was just asked would like to come along and play and just fell in love

74
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,850
with the game straight away.

75
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,189
And I was playing with a lot of my friends that I went to school with.

76
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,769
I was a very shy girl growing up and, you know, I was in track and field.

77
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:39,370
I had a pretty good success at that, but just gravitated to basketball and, you know, started

78
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,430
at the age of nine.

79
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,389
And still have the same passion as I had when I was a nine-year-old.

80
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,029
And Sandy, millions of kids around the world, you know, dream of taking their sport to a

81
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,029
professional level.

82
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,910
Only a handful ever get to your level.

83
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,389
What do you think looking back with the traits that set you apart?

84
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,629
Yeah, I mean, hard work.

85
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,629
I think that helped.

86
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:04,470
And I think like obviously growing up in a sugarcane farm, I used to help out with my

87
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,470
dad.

88
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,470
So lifting pipes.

89
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,430
There was no big, you know, irrigation system or we didn't have any.

90
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,430
We'd be...

91
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,490
You know, lift the pipes in the mud and, you know, carry rocks and stuff like that.

92
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,189
And track and field certainly helped me in my basketball career in those early years.

93
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,949
Just, you know, I was quick, I was strong.

94
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,029
I loved the game.

95
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:28,550
I didn't work on the game a lot as a youngster, which I think helped prolong my career because

96
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,550
I lived in the country.

97
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,389
I talked about my mum not being able to drive.

98
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,089
So I couldn't get to practice in the city as much.

99
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,029
And that's why you spoke about the grass court that my dad did on the water tank.

100
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,069
And so I could really...

101
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,470
I learnt the craft of shooting, being a jump shooter.

102
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,129
Back in the early days, everyone used to say I shot like a man, but, you know, everyone

103
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,310
shoots like that now.

104
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,670
But it was a great skill for me.

105
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,389
I would go out and just shoot.

106
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,029
And a local guy, he played basketball, he taught me that.

107
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,730
And I just spent hours out there and I could only catch and shoot or one bounce because

108
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,730
it wasn't...

109
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,610
It was a grass field court, not a, you know, a bitumen.

110
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,069
So the ball would go everywhere.

111
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,370
It was two dribbles or more, plus I had the water tank, so I didn't want to run into that.

112
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,129
So I perfected the skill of shooting and that was one of my biggest strengths.

113
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,449
And, you know, I still had a lot to learn.

114
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:25,389
And when I went to the AIS, that really just opened up my world for a lot of different

115
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,389
opportunities.

116
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,990
So grateful for all the coaches that helped me to get where I was in my career and also

117
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,990
my coaching career.

118
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,550
Sam, my mind is going to two very famous Australian sporting stories and I hadn't, apart from doing

119
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,870
the research, to understand.

120
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,129
And you and Mackay Queensland on a grass court, and it makes sense, isn't it?

121
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,189
The ball's going to bounce everywhere and you pick it up and you shoot and that repetition.

122
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:51,269
And the great story of Don Bradman, who used to throw a golf ball at a water tank and hit

123
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,129
it with a stick, effectively, not even a cricket bat, and developed this incredible eye on

124
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,370
the back of that success.

125
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,189
And they talk about the Chappell brothers playing backyard cricket in South Australia.

126
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,410
And their mum had, I think, their favourite, it might have been some sort of fruit tree,

127
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,910
but it was at square leg.

128
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,310
And if you hit the fruit tree, mum was going to go ballistic.

129
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,310
And they developed this incredible technique to avoid hitting the fruit tree, which sort

130
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,129
of stood all the Chappell brothers apart, amongst everything else.

131
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,790
Does that sort of resonate with you to think, God, if you had have gone into town and trained

132
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,970
with everyone else, you might have just played a little bit like everyone else too?

133
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,269
Yeah, definitely.

134
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,670
I mean, when you're not getting those daily workouts, a lot of kids are, because I couldn't

135
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,449
get into the city.

136
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,790
The club I played for was just a country team and we used to work, practice on an outdoor

137
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,449
court at a nearby school, but you know, once a week.

138
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:55,269
So yeah, it's just, you know, my dad, he, and it wasn't a backboard that you buy from,

139
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,670
you know, we call it Dick's Sporting Goods here.

140
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,670
I'm not sure what's back home now.

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,670
Rebel Sport.

142
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,670
Rebel Sport.

143
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,670
Okay, there you go.

144
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,670
Rebel Sport.

145
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,670
Yeah.

146
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,569
He actually just got pieces of wood and he just nailed them together, painted it with

147
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,810
it white, put the square on and the only thing he bought was the basketball rim and you know,

148
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,209
I'm forever grateful for that because it allowed me just to hone my skills and I, you know,

149
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:24,529
one of my neighbors, Brian Swindles, he taught me how to do the jump shot and it was, you

150
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,350
know, it helped me to go to four Olympics because that was one of my biggest strengths.

151
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,950
I could certainly shoot the ball and off the dribble and, but you know, obviously to hone

152
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,350
your skill, a lot of hard work continues to go in it.

153
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,769
Not just in the beginning, but over the 18 years that I was a professional athlete and

154
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,590
then the other nine years that I was just a youngster trying to grow in the game.

155
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,250
Hey Sandy, do you think it's possible that we overcoach our young kids a little bit these

156
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,250
days?

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,889
You look back and understand the story of Roger Federer, his mum was a tennis coach,

158
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,870
but she felt like he didn't have the right temperament.

159
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,590
She wouldn't hit balls with him and because until he learned how to behave properly and

160
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,590
he went off and played soccer and all these other sports, table tennis and at the age

161
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,590
of 13, came back to tennis.

162
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:06,789
Yeah.

163
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:06,909
Yeah.

164
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:06,950
Yeah.

165
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,049
Yeah.

166
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:07,149
Yeah.

167
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:07,210
Yeah.

168
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,669
Yeah.

169
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:07,730
Yeah.

170
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:07,769
Yeah.

171
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:07,809
Yeah.

172
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:07,830
Yeah.

173
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,350
When his mum would finally hit the ball with him.

174
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,490
Do you feel like sometimes now, look at this sort of kids that are so drilled at seven

175
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,129
years of age in their chosen sport, they don't do other things because their sort of family

176
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,669
are on a mission to get them to be a world's greatest soccer player.

177
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,230
Is it possible we've maybe overdone it a little bit with the next generation?

178
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,570
Yeah.

179
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:32,330
Look, I'd probably say yes, we have, Dars, because they don't get to just be kids and

180
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,870
experience different sports and, you know, growing up, I talked about, I was in track

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,250
and field.

182
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,870
I was an Australian champion at the age of 12 in long jump

183
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,710
and, you know, played all my school sport.

184
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,450
But I never really loved it as much as basketball.

185
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,370
I started at nine, but at the age of 15 I chose,

186
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,309
I had to choose a sport because there was some, you know,

187
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,509
overlay in our schedules.

188
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,070
And I chose basketball and I talked about I didn't overtrain.

189
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,889
I overtrained when I got older and became a professional.

190
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,509
So that's another story there.

191
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,269
But you felt like you were playing catch up.

192
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,690
But I think a lot of kids today, you see it in America,

193
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,529
obviously we're on base now, that they're spending thousands

194
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,889
and thousands of dollars to try and develop their kids

195
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,570
with personal trainers and all the AAU basketball,

196
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,509
that's the club basketball that they have here,

197
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,909
and trying to get that college scholarship,

198
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,970
which obviously is a lot of money over here.

199
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,269
But I think kids don't get a well-balanced childhood

200
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,350
because they're staying so busy, whereas when they're young,

201
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,769
I think you just need to be kids.

202
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,769
But when they do do a sport, I think teaching

203
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,929
the fundamentals, that's important.

204
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,049
Yeah, beautifully said.

205
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:39,789
I agree.

206
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,629
It seems to be a bit of an arms race, junior sport,

207
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,190
and you're seeing not necessarily letting kids be kids

208
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,830
is an interesting discussion.

209
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,090
Very tiny percentage, Sandy, as I said, play at your level,

210
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:53,750
but even fewer then go on to be outstanding coaches.

211
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,049
And I mentioned in the opener your incredible success in 2004

212
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,289
and a head coach of the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA.

213
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,330
You take them to a record-breaking 29-win, 5-loss season.

214
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,629
You go on to win the championship.

215
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:08,309
That year, I mean, again, what do you think have been the skills

216
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,129
for you as a coach?

217
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,009
Because not all players transition well into coaching.

218
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,610
What's helped you on that front?

219
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,490
Look, I think really it started just with the passion.

220
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,750
Like I knew I wasn't going to be able to play for the rest of my life,

221
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,610
and I retired at the age of 36 after the Athens Olympics,

222
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,669
and I just had injuries, and I felt like I had accomplished

223
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,490
anything that I had to, and I didn't have that same drive.

224
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,690
But I still loved the game.

225
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,549
You know, I felt like I could give back

226
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:37,610
to the next generation, and I wanted to coach

227
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,750
at the highest level.

228
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,049
And another thing that really helps me there is, you know,

229
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,549
my partner at the time, now my husband, was a professional coach,

230
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,950
so a head coach, and I got to see all the preparation

231
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,809
that he went into it, and, you know, it's not just like a player.

232
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:53,629
It's totally different.

233
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,490
Now, players don't understand how much a coach actually prepares

234
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,250
for a game until they do it themselves.

235
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,090
But it just fascinated me.

236
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,710
I just wanted to give back.

237
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,509
I wanted to stay in the game, and I wanted

238
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:04,529
to be a part of it.

239
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,850
I wanted to coach the very best, and I retired,

240
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,309
and the next year I was lucky enough to get an assistant coaching job

241
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,690
with the San Antonio Silver Stars under, you know,

242
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,269
a great coach in Dan Hughes and a mentor, and he helped.

243
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,850
That was the beginning, so forever grateful for that opportunity.

244
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,090
And, you know, the rest is history, but I've had a lot of highs,

245
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,950
but I've also had so many lows too, but I think that's a part

246
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,830
of the whole journey to get me to where I am now,

247
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,870
and I'm sure I'll continue to have those highs and lows because

248
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,409
that's about the journey, but that enables me

249
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,450
to continue to be the very best I can be because I'm not,

250
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,990
I keep telling my players, I'm not perfect,

251
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,470
so we can strive for perfection, but let's just make sure

252
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,610
we're putting in the work and trying to be the very best

253
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,809
we can on every given day.

254
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,110
And, Sandy, you mentioned your husband, Olaf,

255
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,389
who's got an extraordinary coaching career over many,

256
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,129
many years.

257
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,230
He's also now your assistant coach at the New York Liberty,

258
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,850
which is an amazing dynamic, isn't it, to have your husband

259
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,610
and partner working alongside you.

260
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,269
Can you tell us?

261
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,690
Can you tell us about how that works?

262
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,950
And I'm sure there's some moments and there's a lot of upside as well.

263
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:09,629
What's it like?

264
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,789
It is, it really is great.

265
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,549
You know, we haven't always had the opportunity to work together,

266
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,590
but our, you know, our connection went back when I was a player.

267
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,250
He was the coach in one of my teams over in Germany.

268
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,750
No one knew that we were actually together because that was our jobs

269
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,549
and it was not, you know, no one's business, to be quite honest,

270
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,370
and then, you know, we're passionate about what we're doing

271
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,250
and that was the most important.

272
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,769
But when I retired, we were assistant coaches together

273
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:42,649
in San Antonio Silver Stars as well and then, you know,

274
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,289
we went to coach in Russia and he was the head coach there

275
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,210
and I was his assistant.

276
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,409
So it's not a problem.

277
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,710
It kept our family together.

278
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,070
You know, once I retired, you know, we have two children,

279
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,409
Brody and Jada, and it's nice when you start a family.

280
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,850
I mean, being a mum and a dad is very important,

281
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,350
but if we could do it together, that was, you know, great,

282
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,889
especially in those early years.

283
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,950
But, yeah, Olaf kept coaching in Russia,

284
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,110
but I in the off-season would coach in Phoenix.

285
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,429
And so we were a little bit separate then,

286
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,429
but we've coached against each other in the WNBA.

287
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,370
He was with Chicago.

288
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,669
I lost to them in the 2021 WNBA Championship in the fourth game.

289
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,330
So that was heartbreaking, but most, you know, for me too,

290
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,649
but heartbreaking for my kids because they were crying more

291
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,570
about me losing than dad winning.

292
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,750
But he was assistant coach, so I think that was a little bit different.

293
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,750
But now, like, we're coaching with the New York Liberty,

294
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,929
and it's nice.

295
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,990
Even though we live half a year in Phoenix,

296
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,809
our kids are back in Phoenix going to school.

297
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,389
They spend as much time as they can with us during the season

298
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,409
and off the season.

299
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,990
We're with them the whole time.

300
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,629
But he's got a brilliant mind, Olaf.

301
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,269
He compliments me.

302
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,110
We're not the same.

303
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,889
He challenges me, which I think that's great.

304
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,009
That's great for my growth.

305
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,389
But he doesn't have a problem.

306
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,330
He loves what he does.

307
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,490
He could be a head coach.

308
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,250
We know that.

309
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,330
But, you know, for the best part of our family,

310
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,350
it's making sure that we stay together right now.

311
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,929
And I'm always interested when I sit down with people like you

312
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,389
who've had, you know, an incredible life of success.

313
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,309
And as you said, we focus on these conversations,

314
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,710
always on the achievements, but there's always plenty

315
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,789
of bumps along the way.

316
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:22,250
But, you know, to have two kids and have two high-performing coaches

317
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,350
for parents and an elite athlete for a mum,

318
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,710
I mean, how's the parenting leadership style on the home front?

319
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,889
How does that go?

320
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,149
Yeah, that is a great question.

321
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,909
I think, you know, there's a lot of laughter.

322
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,330
Yeah, I'm the fun mum.

323
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,730
Dad's the serious one and he's got a very dry wit.

324
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,909
He's German, so that's where that comes from.

325
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,929
But, look, we just try and help our kids.

326
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,509
We give them so many experiences.

327
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:52,710
You know, us being, them being on this journey with us coaching

328
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,309
all around the world, they had this unique opportunity

329
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,970
to be a part of it as well, you know, getting to visit

330
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,149
so many different countries, live in different countries,

331
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,330
but also be around.

332
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,570
Teams and interact with the players.

333
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,210
I thought it definitely has, you know, helped their, you know,

334
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,330
their development as well.

335
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,250
But as a coach, you know, obviously it's they both play basketball

336
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,389
and it's, you know, we want to help them as much.

337
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,269
And our daughter, she's like driven our son, you know, he's 16.

338
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,549
And sometimes I really just have to remember that I'm a mum first

339
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,710
and, you know, not a coach.

340
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,470
But even though like when he asks, I'm going to obviously give him

341
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,330
very honest opinion to both of them.

342
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,809
And Olaf does the same thing.

343
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,970
And, you know, we're there.

344
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,769
We don't force them into play basketball at all.

345
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,409
We want them to enjoy as many other sports as they can.

346
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,769
But, you know, our son in particular loves the game.

347
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,370
And, you know, and hopefully he can achieve, you know,

348
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,230
whatever he aspires to from the game.

349
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,309
And Sandy, we've had this great privilege of overlapping with you

350
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,370
in a space that we're really passionate about.

351
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,029
Elita Connect is a program that my great friend Matt Wadowitz,

352
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,769
and it's timely actually because he was just with you last night.

353
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,250
It's the New York Liberty game.

354
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,589
And I'm a little jealous.

355
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,910
I'm getting these great photos come back from New York

356
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,829
and he's sitting courtside watching you and your team perform.

357
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,150
But we're really passionate about these groups that are forming

358
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,569
around the globe of bringing together people like you

359
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,309
into bespoke groups of five or six people.

360
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,650
And it's a fascinating group that you connect with in Elita Connect

361
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,210
on a regular basis.

362
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,730
Justin Lepich, who's the triple premiership Brisbane Lion,

363
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,789
current assistant coach at Collingwood.

364
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:33,269
They're doing incredible.

365
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:33,289
They're doing incredible.

366
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:33,309
They're doing incredible.

367
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:34,369
They're doing incredible things at the moment.

368
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:38,170
John Bertram, the Hall of Fame legend of Australian sport.

369
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,190
His story is just remarkable.

370
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,470
John, Australia too, and winning the America's Cup

371
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,930
after 150 years of US dominance.

372
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,529
Daryl Franklin's based in the US.

373
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,329
He's the chief of staff at the Green Bay Packers.

374
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,089
Brad Fittler, legend of New South Wales Rugby League

375
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,990
and current coach of the State of Origin for New South Wales.

376
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:57,670
Pat Clifton, who's the assistant vice president

377
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,650
of player health and performance at the NBA

378
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,369
and Australian guy who's doing extraordinary things

379
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:03,269
on the globe.

380
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,730
Daryl, can you tell us a little bit about what that's meant

381
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,170
and how you've enjoyed that program, Elita Connect?

382
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:14,150
Look, Daz, I've actually loved it, every single moment of it.

383
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,509
And, you know, it's really great to be connected

384
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:23,410
with other leaders from different fields and just communicating.

385
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,589
And obviously we were led by Stacey Morling,

386
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,690
who is fantastic at facilitating.

387
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,410
And I've looked forward to every meeting that we've had.

388
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,230
It's just to share.

389
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,450
And you're building a community of trust within, you know,

390
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,450
some pretty amazing people and sharing ideas

391
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,750
and overcoming kind of hurdles that we all have

392
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,009
in our profession at any different time.

393
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,150
And, look, I've been a sponge.

394
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,730
I've really, really thoroughly enjoyed it

395
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,150
and always look forward to the next meeting.

396
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,970
And the meetings go for an hour and a quarter.

397
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,609
And given where everyone is located around the globe,

398
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,490
you're able to fit that in.

399
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,269
Everyone's got these incredibly busy schedules

400
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,049
in the world that you're running.

401
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:03,150
Yeah.

402
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,049
Has it helped you in your leadership style, do you think, Sandy?

403
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,329
Yeah, no, definitely it has.

404
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,089
I think when you start talking to other leaders,

405
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,990
you realise that you have very similar issues.

406
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,650
And we're not just coaches.

407
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,349
We're from different – we have a few coaches, different roles.

408
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,349
And it's just fascinating.

409
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,910
But we've learnt – like I've learnt a ton.

410
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,269
Like I felt like I've grown as a leader by just having this experience,

411
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:32,049
having a community because I always talk as a head coach, as a leader.

412
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:33,049
You know, it can be a little bit of a challenge,

413
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:34,589
but it can be lonely at the top at times.

414
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,329
And, you know, putting these groups together,

415
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,849
you feel like it's a group where you can be vulnerable

416
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,049
and ask for thoughts from, you know,

417
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:48,309
obviously these great people that I have on my group

418
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,670
and just get ideas how to handle different situations

419
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,710
that we've all come across at different times.

420
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,609
And, you know, obviously having John Bertrand,

421
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,829
who has so much wisdom, you know,

422
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,710
really just kind of like the icing on the cake.

423
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,849
But, yeah, no, thoroughly enjoyable.

424
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,470
It certainly has helped me become better.

425
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,390
And, really, I just aspire to actually do more now.

426
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,750
Yeah, it's beautiful to hear, Sandy.

427
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,170
And we're really passionate about that sort of community expanding

428
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,829
because you want to – as you said, someone like John at his stage of life

429
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,509
has got so much to share and you just feel like you want to capture that.

430
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:25,390
And, likewise, your world experience and everyone really brings to the table.

431
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,230
It doesn't matter what stage of life you're at.

432
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,329
And we love the idea of having younger people with people

433
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,630
of a different generation or female.

434
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,170
Leaders are doing extraordinary stuff like you are

435
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,869
with diverse leaders from different backgrounds.

436
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,130
Would you recommend it to other people?

437
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,890
Oh, yeah, without a doubt.

438
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,950
Look, I've – you know, obviously, Brianna Stewart,

439
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:45,089
she's one of my great players on the New York Liberty.

440
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,230
She's on a group and I've test-matched in the Captain of Australia.

441
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,509
I encourage a lot of the people.

442
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,829
I'm always saying, hey, you guys need to get in one of these groups

443
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:59,190
because it's just sharing and it's just the trust that you can build

444
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,289
and the similar experiences that you can go through.

445
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,029
But, for me,

446
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,670
it's just more that community feel.

447
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,650
And it's really special and it's obviously well-led.

448
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,970
You all do a fantastic job.

449
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,970
But, yeah, if anyone's interested in becoming better leaders,

450
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,450
they should certainly be a part of it.

451
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,789
Thanks, Sandy.

452
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,549
We really feel grateful to have the connection with you.

453
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:23,730
And, as you said, Stacey's doing an incredible job

454
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,210
as someone who started in one of our groups,

455
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,470
who's done an amazing job as a facilitator.

456
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:29,869
I'm interested in your perspective,

457
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,509
someone very passionate about playing for Australia.

458
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,849
I know you stood out of seasons in the WNBA

459
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:37,490
to represent Australia and make that a priority.

460
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,230
You've got a great perspective on American sport

461
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,930
and European sport as well.

462
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:45,109
But Australia and US sport, what's the difference in your mind?

463
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,109
Look, the WNBA for us, I'm just focused on women's basketball now.

464
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,769
I mean, it's the very best players in the world.

465
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,049
So, it's a global game here.

466
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,589
Yes, there's mostly Americans.

467
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,650
Australians are well-represented here in the WNBA.

468
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,349
But, you know, I have a French girl on my team,

469
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,609
a Chinese girl, someone from Bahamas.

470
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,529
And that's fantastic because everyone wants to play against the best,

471
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,369
you know, test themselves against the best.

472
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,869
But there's only 144 spots available in our league

473
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,849
because we only have 12 games because it is the elite of the elite.

474
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,569
But, you know, back in Australia, it's a very strong league as well.

475
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,670
I think it's very close to maybe being the second-best league

476
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,289
in the world behind maybe WNBA but maybe EuroLeague as well,

477
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,329
the best teams in Europe that play against each other.

478
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:38,269
And, you know, Australians, like we've – we're a world force, you know.

479
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,470
We've got these great individuals, you know, coming from the Penny Taylor

480
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,069
to the Lauren Jackson to Christy Harawa, you know, coming into the phase

481
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,849
that we have now with Kayla George, Mariana Tolo.

482
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,750
And we've got the newcomers coming in, Jade Melbourne, you know,

483
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,650
this 20-year-old playing with the Seattle Storm at the moment, you know,

484
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,890
taking them all by storm.

485
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,269
And we just got a lot of depth back in Australia.

486
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:01,970
I think Australians are really fundamentally strong.

487
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:04,089
They're fundamentally skilled.

488
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:06,390
And they know how to play the game in the right way.

489
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,869
And that's a credit to our grassroots and the coaches that we have back there.

490
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,329
And it's great that we have great success there as well.

491
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:19,569
But the biggest difference would be overall depth of talent between the two leagues,

492
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:23,630
you know, but Australia is certainly up there and it's a very competitive league.

493
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,269
You mentioned some incredible names, a lot of them are old teammates of yours.

494
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:31,009
You coached Penny Taylor in that championship win in 2014.

495
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,329
Lauren Jackson was the number one pick.

496
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:38,470
In her draft and has gone on to be, you know, one of the world's greatest ever players.

497
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,910
It's an incredible story, isn't it?

498
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,650
How well Australian women have done in basketball, winning Olympic medals consistently.

499
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,589
It's an over-representation for a country our size.

500
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,730
What do you put that down to?

501
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,049
Yeah, look, I wish our game was even bigger in Australia because of the success that we've had.

502
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:01,650
You know, I played, 1984 was the first Olympics.

503
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,190
The Opals have won.

504
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,630
I went through in LA and in 88 was my first Olympics in Seoul.

505
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,490
And we were the very first team to beat Russia.

506
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:18,029
We ultimately had a heartbreak against Yugoslavia in the semifinal game and lost the bronze medal to Russia in the last game of the tournament.

507
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,650
But, you know, we've had great success.

508
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,210
We won our first medal in 96 and continue to do that every year.

509
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,549
And we've had a few hiccups along the way in Tokyo.

510
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,809
I don't want to get too deep into that, but that was one of them.

511
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,789
But it's hard to win.

512
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,630
Players get better, but I think the depth of Australian talent continues to be constant.

513
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:50,349
I think that helps with the standard of the league that we have back in the WNBL, but also the players coming over to the WNBA and obviously improving their games by playing against the very best and getting that experience as well.

514
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:52,670
And a lot of it comes down to coaching, too.

515
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:58,710
You know, I think we invest in coaching development and ultimately that overhelps all of our players.

516
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,630
My biggest wish is that more people...

517
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,509
More of the NBA.

518
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:02,029
Yeah.

519
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,549
More of the Australian Opals players will household names.

520
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:06,670
So I think that's the thing.

521
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:13,789
We had a great World Cup last year, finishing with the bronze medal, and we have the Asia Cup coming up very soon at the end of this month.

522
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,029
But, you know, we had great support there.

523
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:24,309
But I think, you know, it's hard to be competitive in Australia with all the great sports that we have, but we want to make sure that we can continue to grow.

524
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:31,349
And Sandy, I love asking these set of questions because, you know, you learn so much from someone who's achieved what you have.

525
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:38,190
And your values and, you know, just hear about your passion for connecting with people and to hear the word community a lot in your language.

526
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,269
And I understand that's a great strength of yours and why you're so successful, your ability to build relationships with people.

527
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:51,869
But we feel success does leave clues, and these dimensions of leadership are part of that pattern for us, starting with self-leadership.

528
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:58,029
Sandy, what does that thought mean to you around leading others from starting with yourself?

529
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,470
Well, I think that's the most important thing.

530
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,910
I know.

531
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,349
People always ask me, I mean, what kind of leader am I?

532
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:11,470
Like I talk, I'm a servant leader because I want to help others to be the very best that they can be.

533
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,470
But self-leadership is making sure you're looking at yourself in the mirror and what are my strengths?

534
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,950
What are the areas I need to work on?

535
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,109
How can I impact people's lives?

536
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:24,430
Because that's what you're doing as a leader in a positive way.

537
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,950
And that doesn't mean it's always rosy, but you can still impact people's lives in a positive way.

538
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,630
And, you know, that's self-reflection.

539
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,309
It's always continued to grow, that self-leadership.

540
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,589
But I always say, don't be something that you're not when you take over a leadership role.

541
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:46,630
Because I tell my players, you will see consistency out of me every day, win, lose, whatever, because that's a part of the journey.

542
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,750
And I want them to make sure we're in this journey together.

543
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,069
And if we can stay together, great things can happen.

544
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:58,869
I love that term you use, a servant leader, and the idea of wanting to, you know, impact others.

545
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,470
That's the sort of title of this podcast.

546
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,069
The podcast effectively around empowering other people.

547
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,509
And that's what great leaders do.

548
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:10,109
And you went to the next dimension automatically almost, the idea of positively impacting people on a daily basis.

549
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,309
It sounds like that's a real focus of yours.

550
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:14,029
How have you gone about that?

551
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:20,069
Yeah, look, I think, you know, as a shy kid growing up, you know, sport was my haven.

552
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:24,309
I kind of became this, you know, very competitive person.

553
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,349
But it was more about having fun and doing the very best I could.

554
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:29,950
And I knew I grew, like, it wasn't always hard.

555
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,589
Coaches are different over the years than when I was coached.

556
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:36,390
Not as much feedback, you know, more yelling.

557
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,789
But I always feel like, you know, I know what got the best out of me.

558
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,829
You know, I always felt someone that believed in you, you know.

559
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:48,589
And that was Adrian Hurley when I first went to the AIS back in 1986.

560
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:52,109
I knew I was a great shooter and I was going to keep getting better and better.

561
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,869
And he believed in me.

562
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,190
He said, you're going to be an Australian player.

563
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,630
You're going to have this wonderful career.

564
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,390
And I'm like, really?

565
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,589
And just those.

566
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:00,710
Those words.

567
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,309
And he's still a mentor to this very day.

568
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:05,630
He doesn't, it was life changing.

569
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,869
And that's what I, you know, it's having someone that cares for you that much,

570
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:12,549
but believes in you that much more than that you did.

571
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:14,230
That's all I kind of needed as a kid.

572
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,390
And then that positivity.

573
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,390
I'm a very positive person.

574
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,589
You know, some players may not always like that.

575
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:24,670
Now I can be direct, but I'm always going to be constructive and positive

576
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,430
because I think if we can empower the players to believe,

577
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:33,309
they have this mass potential, then they will believe it.

578
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,789
And we can help them on that journey.

579
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,390
And I think that really goes a long way.

580
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,430
And Sandy, I'm fascinated hearing you say that.

581
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,630
I think we're of a similar generation and probably grew up with similar types of coaches,

582
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,230
but I feel like it spawned a generation of coaches exactly like you who went,

583
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,869
hey, you know, I can handle the yelling.

584
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:51,990
That wasn't a problem.

585
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,269
But what was the most effective?

586
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,670
And it feels like you're right when someone genuinely believes in you, gives you direct feedback,

587
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,430
but sees your ability.

588
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,869
And wants to nurture.

589
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,829
That's where you really see the great growth.

590
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:06,950
And I'm not surprised you're coaching that way as a whole generation now are.

591
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,630
It feels like a much healthier and smarter way to go about it.

592
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,990
We see people in your roles and leaders in different areas are really conscious about how they create and share their vision.

593
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,950
How have you gone about that in your world?

594
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:28,950
Yeah, look, I think, you know, it's an evolving vision because basketball is changing year by year.

595
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:35,430
And I think that's the part is being open to adapt to what the changes are.

596
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:40,630
Look, I feel like I love the game, like I'm always studying the game.

597
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:50,109
I'm a student of the game, but I love teaching the game to simplify it so everyone can understand it and helping the skill set what's required here.

598
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:51,269
And that's a part of my journey.

599
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,109
I mean, like, I don't stay stuck in what I've done 10 years ago.

600
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,549
It's my, I stay up with the trends, what are today.

601
00:29:57,549 --> 00:29:58,789
But I'm making sure that I'm adapting to the players.

602
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,269
I'm adapting to the players that I have instead of them adapting to what I want to do.

603
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,589
And I think that's obviously really important.

604
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:11,670
And it makes me, you know, change and mold to be better.

605
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,029
And like I said, the game, like we obviously, a lot of us, we watch the game.

606
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,069
We're looking at the NBA.

607
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:18,710
That's what I do.

608
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,630
We have similar rules like the WNBA.

609
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,230
So I'm looking at what they do.

610
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,589
It's not a power game as much.

611
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,789
It's all about the spacing and how we can actually exploit all the defenses that are being played.

612
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:28,789
I think European.

613
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,869
Basketball, you know, we're all just stealing plays off each other.

614
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:34,269
That's part of the evolution and the vision.

615
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:36,109
And it's always, it's ongoing.

616
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,910
Now, I think my core values remain the same.

617
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,990
I think that's how I want to play the game.

618
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,470
Having, you know, being selfless on the offensive end and, you know, the spacing and making

619
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,470
sure we're taking great shots and, you know, not forcing action.

620
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,230
Whereas defensively, I have non-negotiables, which, you know, if we do this, we're going

621
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,470
to have success, but it's trying to get consistency with that.

622
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,670
But then obviously just molding.

623
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,910
How we can be the very best team by, you know, learning from others.

624
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,910
Yeah.

625
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,910
I love that combination of really strong values and consistency there, but openly wanting

626
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,710
to be better and evolve, isn't it?

627
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,430
You often see organizations that are trying to hang on to the past and the way things

628
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,569
are done and not, you know, as you said, it's constantly changing and moving forward.

629
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,750
And I can hear the curiosity in your tone.

630
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,549
It's that constantly learning and wanting to get better.

631
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,750
And I'm not surprised that Aleda Connect is something that you've loved through that curiosity.

632
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,069
And we see people really, through curiosity, that's how they want to get better and develop.

633
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,990
Does that resonate with you?

634
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,990
Yeah.

635
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,990
Yeah.

636
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,990
Without a doubt.

637
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,910
You know, I've spoken about this has been my passion since the age of nine.

638
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,690
You know, obviously starting to play basketball, learn basketball, seeing where basketball

639
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,990
has taken me, you know, going to the Olympic games.

640
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,529
I mean, who would have dreamt I went to one Olympic games?

641
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:52,549
Not everyone gets to do that.

642
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,990
I went to four and, you know, it's just blown away.

643
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,990
I love the competitiveness.

644
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:03,230
But I think you have to, it's like I said, the curiosity is more is continue to learn.

645
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:08,250
I always wanted to be the best player I could be, not be better than my teammate or someone

646
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:16,309
else, but trying to learn from others how they do things, you know, asking questions,

647
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,309
finding mentors.

648
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,670
I think that's critical for anyone's development at any level.

649
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,910
You know, I think mentors, they can help you along the way because it's not just a physical

650
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,230
thing that we do with basketball.

651
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,230
You know, there's the mental part.

652
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,990
There's the physical part.

653
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,990
There's the emotional part.

654
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,369
There's the physiological stuff that we all have to learn to be the very best that we

655
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:32,369
can be.

656
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:38,230
And, you know, I've got to know a lot of different people and the curiosity part comes from just

657
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,230
digging, asking them questions.

658
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,230
How?

659
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:46,269
And that's why I love the letter because it's fantastic just because we had so many different

660
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:49,490
leaders that you could just, you know, connect with.

661
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,869
And I've had Zooms, you know, I love just reaching out to them and just digging deeper

662
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:54,990
and how they do things.

663
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,990
And regardless of it.

664
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,990
It was in there.

665
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,930
It was in the NFL, the NRL, the AFL, just coaches.

666
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,410
And I love that we wanted to share and help each other, you know, because we can all learn

667
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,589
from each other because in business world too, I mean, because leadership is not just

668
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,589
in sports.

669
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,289
I mean, you see leaderships because it's all about developing a culture where you can actually

670
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:17,289
grow the most.

671
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,710
And I'm massive on that.

672
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,950
It's not just what you do in practice.

673
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,950
I'm really big on let's build the right culture.

674
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,369
What kind of team do we want to be and how are we going to get there?

675
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,369
Yeah.

676
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:28,369
Yeah.

677
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,369
I love hearing your passion.

678
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:34,690
I can see it come out on the screen and the positive energy that flows out of the smile

679
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,269
on your face.

680
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:38,849
Communicating with clarity is another dimension we see really consistently.

681
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,849
How have you gone about that in your world, Sandy?

682
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:48,509
I think communication is probably one of my biggest strengths because I was a player and

683
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:53,369
I played with, you know, so much, you know, so many different people all around the world.

684
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,369
I've played in Europe and, you know, obviously the Olympics.

685
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,369
I've played in Europe and, you know, obviously the Olympics.

686
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,369
Yeah.

687
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,369
And the WNBA.

688
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:03,730
And I always found getting to know the person on their personal level.

689
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,529
I think that's important because you know how everyone ticks and that's where you can

690
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:08,530
get the most chemistry.

691
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,469
You know, I know some players and coaches, mate, it doesn't matter what they do off the

692
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,469
court.

693
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,969
For me, I think it does matter.

694
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:21,130
I think you can build more connections and being very, having great communication and

695
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,130
honest communication.

696
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,369
I'm not talking about always just patting everyone on the back because there's sometimes, you

697
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:30,750
have to have hard communication, but that's a part of helping, you know, whoever it is

698
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,409
you're talking to, to be the best version that they can be.

699
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,250
But yeah, so building relationships, it's just something I've always tried to do and

700
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,670
I think I've grew as a player, especially when I was entering the end of my career and

701
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:47,130
then started mentoring the younger players because I went through what they did, you

702
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,409
know, and I didn't have as, you know, you had great players that were helping me, you

703
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,409
know.

704
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,469
When I first made the Australian team, I was a very shy and timid 18-year-old.

705
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,469
Yeah.

706
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:59,789
But driven and have the older players took me under their wing and, you know, I did that

707
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:04,250
at the end of my Opals career and even when I got into the coaching career, I had other

708
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:10,409
mentors that can obviously help me and it was all about connections, building relationships

709
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,909
with really healthy communication.

710
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:13,909
And you're right, isn't it, Sandy?

711
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:19,230
You go back to the playing days and the unspoken is where you start to question, don't you,

712
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,150
when your coach hasn't reached out and communicated with you or you feel like you're, even at the

713
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,150
end of your career, isn't it?

714
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,150
It just creates that uncertainty.

715
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,590
As you said, you're open to however direct the feedback, but at least you know where

716
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,590
you're sitting.

717
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,349
It sounds obvious, but it's often missed, isn't it?

718
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:38,789
In the busy world of leadership, people forget the obvious thing to just communicate consistently

719
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:39,789
and well.

720
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,010
It sounds like it's a huge part of the way you go about it.

721
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,969
How important has collaboration been for you?

722
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:44,969
Yeah.

723
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,969
I mean, very important.

724
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:52,469
It's not like, especially I'm in a team sport, basketball, it's not about me, it's about

725
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:53,469
us.

726
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:57,289
You know, doing it in the right way, doing it together, sharing ideas.

727
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:01,949
I love the part of collaboration, just coming together with the team and finding ways to

728
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:05,849
be the best that we could be as a team and to enjoy the journey.

729
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:12,809
Now as a coach now, I have a pretty big staff underneath me and I want to hear their ideas.

730
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:18,250
I'm all about like, throw them all at me because this is not about me.

731
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,309
You know, this is about us and I have my thoughts and I always tell them, I always want you

732
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:24,309
to have your honest opinion.

733
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,210
That doesn't mean I always agree, but I'm going to listen.

734
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,469
I don't want any like, yes people, like challenge me when you need to, but the collaboration

735
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:36,050
allows us to get to the destination that we want to get to.

736
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,329
And because we can all bring something to the table.

737
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:44,989
And so I try and, you know, give my staff the confidence to speak up, you know, and

738
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:49,429
if they don't like something, speak up, you know, and because then we can get to, like

739
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:52,929
I said, our end destination and hopefully that is winning championships.

740
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,190
But for me, I don't talk about championships once I start a season.

741
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,530
I talk about process.

742
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,690
I'm very process detailed, you know, we just come off a loss.

743
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,210
It's like, okay, what's the solution for us to be better because there's things that you

744
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,210
can touch.

745
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,429
Don't look at the end result.

746
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:13,570
Let's look about the step by step and that's win the day, you know, how can I be better

747
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,570
today individually and collectively.

748
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,570
Yeah.

749
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,829
And we know they're the best environments where everyone feels like they've got a voice,

750
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:20,829
isn't it?

751
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:21,829
Yeah.

752
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:22,829
Yeah.

753
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:25,570
And you can kind of have a sway of opinion your way, but at least you feel like that

754
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,690
open, you know, communications there and you can have a say in your environment.

755
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,329
Sandy, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

756
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:38,710
My parents, you know, I mean, I think everyone says that, but for me, it really is true.

757
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,809
And just the upbringing they gave me growing up on a sugar cane farm, it was very easy

758
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:44,809
going.

759
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:48,949
And it's funny, recently, you know, talk, I'm 55 this year, I talk about, well, you

760
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:51,110
know, my kids will, you know, graduate from school.

761
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,110
I love what I do.

762
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,550
I'm going to continue to coach as long as someone gives me a job.

763
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,050
I love being in a leadership role, but I always think about, okay, where do I want to live?

764
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:04,050
Well, lately, it's more back where I grew up and it's kind of weird, but it's more like,

765
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,050
well, my family's there and I feel it's my community.

766
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:15,170
And it's kind of unique, you know, that we can have that, but I'm enjoying this journey

767
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,170
that I'm on.

768
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,849
Sorry, I've totally lost the bloody question now.

769
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:19,849
Can we start?

770
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:20,849
Well, I love it actually.

771
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:21,849
Yeah.

772
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:25,849
You know, I'm looking at you, Sandy, and the backdrop is the Manhattan skyline.

773
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:31,610
You've just coached the New York Liberty and your mind's going to Mackay, Queensland again.

774
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:36,010
And as you said, you know, you said, I'm sure a lot of people say they're mum and dad.

775
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,349
And the short answer to that, Sandy, is that some people do who really have that connection

776
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,030
and a lot don't, you know, and I feel the same.

777
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,289
If someone asked me that, I would straight away feel as though the upbringing I got are

778
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,289
my mum and dad.

779
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,690
And as you get older, it's a gift, isn't it?

780
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,690
And I'm a bit the same.

781
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,690
Yeah.

782
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,530
It's the same.

783
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,369
As I've got older, I really appreciated where we grew up.

784
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,530
I was desperate to leave Adelaide as a kid.

785
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,110
But now I look back and think, God, that was a great upbringing, wasn't it?

786
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,070
So in your mind, you could end back in the sugarcane fields of Mackay.

787
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,070
Is that a possibility?

788
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,070
Yeah.

789
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,070
Well, I'd be more on the beach, Dast.

790
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,070
But I love the water.

791
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,889
You know, I grew up, like, my parents had a sugarcane farm, but we also had a holiday

792
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,710
house at Seaforth.

793
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,530
And I go back there every time I go back to Australia.

794
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,869
That's because that's where my parents have retired.

795
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:26,210
And I feel, it's just a weird feeling.

796
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,769
That's my haven.

797
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:34,550
Because I feel, this is, listen, I belong here and I can go back and nothing's changed,

798
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,210
which I love.

799
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,989
I still feel like I'm the kid that was there from the age of eight.

800
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:43,969
And I'm going back and I'm, you know, hanging out, you know, it's just a special feeling.

801
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:44,969
But I love the beach.

802
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:48,369
Initially, it was the Gold Coast, you know, I think now I can't live in a really small

803
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,369
town of Mackay.

804
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:50,369
Yeah.

805
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,309
But I know, you know, it's about family.

806
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,150
It's about those relationships that we have and spending quality time with the people

807
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,150
that you love.

808
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,349
But, you know, that's not for a few years off, but, you know, I want to keep hope doing

809
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:07,610
this and, you know, trying to keep improving as a coach for as many years as someone will

810
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,610
want me.

811
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,610
Where's Seaforth?

812
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,610
Seaforth is in between, it's about 40 minutes outside of Mackay.

813
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,610
Okay.

814
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,610
Yeah.

815
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,610
It's on the way going to Airlie Beach.

816
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,610
Ah, beautiful.

817
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,610
Beautiful.

818
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,849
Beautiful part of the world.

819
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:22,849
Yeah.

820
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:23,849
It's very nice.

821
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:28,949
I'm not surprised that your heart and your upbringing is dragging you back there at some

822
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:29,949
stage.

823
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:34,369
Sandy, if you can collaborate with anyone on anything, we're passionate about it at

824
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:37,429
Aleda and that sense of world of collaboration and what it looks like.

825
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:40,949
And you're involved in some great collaborations and it sounds like you've had great mentors

826
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:41,949
along the way.

827
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:45,889
Has there been someone you thought, God, that's the person I'd love to connect and collaborate

828
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:46,889
with?

829
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,429
Well, so many, really.

830
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:49,429
Yeah.

831
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:51,550
You know, really so many.

832
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,610
And I look at the, obviously I look at the basketball world and there's been some amazing

833
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,369
coaches and I've got to know Brian Gorgie and he's just a wealth of knowledge and just

834
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,329
how he's adapted over the years too.

835
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:04,610
I think it's always fascinating and got the best.

836
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,010
He's just a brilliant mind.

837
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,309
Steve Kerr, someone that would be, you know, someone I'd love to get to know and just the

838
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,670
success that he's had, but the culture that he built, because that's so important for

839
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,670
me.

840
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,769
I mean, because you've got star players and they've got to buy into playing the game in

841
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,769
the world.

842
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,110
They're playing the game in the right way and they do it beautifully.

843
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,650
And, you know, you have to have great players to play great too.

844
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:29,530
We understand that as well, but yeah, he just has a great demeanour and just how he connects

845
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,530
to his players.

846
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,090
I think that's important, but there's so many that I've got to see and, you know, I follow

847
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,090
a lot of sport.

848
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,590
I still read the Australian newspaper every day, even though I haven't lived in there

849
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,590
over two decades.

850
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:46,710
I'm more NRL and basketball, but I still follow the AFL and now that obviously I have a connection

851
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,889
to Justin Lepish.

852
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:47,969
Yeah.

853
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:48,090
Yeah.

854
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:48,150
Yeah.

855
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,210
Yeah.

856
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,269
Yeah.

857
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:48,329
Yeah.

858
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:48,389
Yeah.

859
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:48,449
Yeah.

860
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:48,469
Yeah.

861
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:48,489
Yeah.

862
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:48,530
Yeah.

863
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:48,550
Yeah.

864
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,590
Yeah.

865
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:52,650
I, you know, obviously follow his team and they're doing great and his coach is amazing

866
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:57,769
and he's got, you know, Craig McBride, you know, just hearing so many wonderful things

867
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:01,429
about him and I could probably go on and on.

868
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,889
I just, I could, yeah, and that's what I love about being part of this leadership group

869
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:12,469
is just to, you know, build connections and I just, I know that they're going to grow

870
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:18,170
in the future and hopefully in the end that, you know, I can be the best leader that I

871
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,429
can be.

872
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:21,969
But hopefully I'm giving some back from my experiences because I've certainly had a few.

873
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:27,070
They're not always, you know, you know, cherry on top, but I've learned along the way and

874
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,269
that's why I said, what do I need to do to be better?

875
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:33,070
And I'm always self-reflecting and I think that's been a strong part of my journey as

876
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,889
a player and a coach.

877
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:39,429
Sandy, it's been a great joy to spend some time with you today and I can feel the positive

878
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:44,829
energy that comes out of everything you say and I'm not surprised that you've had the

879
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,349
success right along the journey.

880
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:47,989
It's an amazing story.

881
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:54,590
For me, growing up in that part of Queensland to international sporting success and I love

882
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,710
that maybe one day it's going to come full circle and back home to Australia.

883
00:42:58,849 --> 00:42:59,429
Thanks so much.

884
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:02,949
We're really privileged to connect with you and Alita Connect and thanks for taking the

885
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:03,349

886
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,150
No, I appreciate it, Dars.

887
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:05,969
