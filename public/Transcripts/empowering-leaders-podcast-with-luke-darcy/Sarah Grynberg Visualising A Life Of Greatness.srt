00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,169
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Sarah Grinberg, the host of A Life

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,009
of Greatness podcast, which I encourage everyone to download and listen to.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,730
Sarah has a brilliant story and she talks to me about how visualization has helped her

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,649
to create the life that she loves and leads now.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,429
The kindness that Hamish and Annie, two of the legends of Australian entertainment and

6
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,250
media, showed her and how that has influenced Sarah in the way that she works with others

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,350
on a daily basis.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,969
Sarah also talks about the really powerful daily routines and habits that keep her healthy

9
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:42,350
and successful and how the key to living a life of greatness for her is all about being

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,409
your authentic self.

11
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,590
Really enjoyed this chat with Sarah Grinberg.

12
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,070
I hope you do as much as I did.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,450

Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team at Temper Bedding.

22
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,730
We know that great leaders value sleep and you can hear Sarah talk about how important

23
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,349
sleep is in the people that she's spoken with.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,709
Temper is a mattress like no other.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,450
Investing in that, given we spend a third of our life in bed, is a decision that you

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,090
will not regret.

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,019
Sarah Grinberg.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,640
Sarah was executive producer for arguably the most successful radio program in radio

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,420
history, The Hamish and Andy Show.

30
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,840
Her passion for living a life of true purpose, finding your own purpose, and not dying with

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,340
the music in you is the foundation for her brilliant podcast, A Life of Greatness.

32
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,540
Sarah has interviewed the likes of Deepak Chopra, Simon Sinek, Matthew McConaughey,

33
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,260
Rich Roll, Jay Shetty, Seth Godin, and many more.

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,680
And I highly recommend, like my wife Bec, Sarah does every single week, and I listen

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,859
to her podcast every single week.

36
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,140
So if you want to listen to her podcast every single week, you can download A Life of Greatness

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,400
and hear some of Sarah's outstanding work.

38
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,099
Great to see you, Sarah.

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you, Luke.

40
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,699
That's so nice.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,099
Oh, I used to see you regularly in the corridors and walk past and say hello.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,699
We were working different radio shows, but we crossed paths regularly.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,620
Can you take us back to working on Hamish and Andy?

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,439
What did you learn from two of the nicest guys in the world, by the way?

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,639
Oh, two of the nicest guys in the world.

46
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,659
I want to actually start because it's just triggered in my mind.

47
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,219
And I first met you when I was starting to be a producer.

48
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,120
And I was interested.

49
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,219
And Jay Muller was producing the Triple M morning show that you were on.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,500
And I came in and Sarah Fayol was the producer as well.

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,300
And they were like, you can come sit with us.

52
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:50,400
So before I started work every day doing like I was in the activations team, I would sit

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,300
with Jay and Sarah and I would watch your show.

54
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,599
And then they'd say like, do you have any questions or anything like that?

55
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,919
And they kind of saw a lot of the light in me and they were like, you'll be a really

56
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,219
good producer one day.

57
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,099
And that was like.

58
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,520
What I would come in early in the morning, unpaid, obviously I didn't do much, but watch.

59
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,560
But it kind of was the start of like producing, which then got into hosting and, you know.

60
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,039
Well, that's coming back to me now.

61
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,180
So I can picture that.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,180
I've forgotten that.

63
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,080
And you're always very friendly.

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,039
Well, that's nice.

65
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,340
Because as you know, that time of morning has its moments.

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,099
I mean, I'll talk to you about that as well.

67
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:32,060
But Hamish and Andy are special people in their own way, but really the positive, brilliant

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,520
way that they've been able to help me.

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,680
Yeah.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,699
Yeah.

71
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:32,719
Yeah.

72
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:32,740
Yeah.

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah.

74
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:32,860
Yeah.

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:32,879
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah.

77
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,060
They have their success.

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,280
Did that rub off on you?

79
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,060
Absolutely.

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,020
I think there was, you know, it's funny when you go into producing, like firstly, I think

81
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,379
it's Australia's biggest podcast and they just finished radio and they kind of had delved

82
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,719
into the podcast space a little bit before and then they were just starting up their

83
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,580
podcast and I got asked if I wanted to be their executive producer.

84
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,060
So there's this imposter syndrome that you get when you're about to work with two of

85
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,860
Australia's biggest names.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,840
And, you know, their last producer, they're going to be their biggest producer.

87
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,020
producers, Sam Kavanagh, their last executive producer, who is, you know, one of Australia's

88
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,419
best producers. So then I'm going into this thinking, oh my God, how long am I going to

89
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:20,620
last in here? Like, how did I get this role? This is amazing. But, you know, am I good enough? That

90
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,560
kind of thought goes through your mind. Anyway, after a few months, I realised that they were

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,100
thinking that I was doing a really good job, but still the voices saying like, do they really think

92
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,600
you are? They're going to find you out. You know, you're not that good. And then, you know, I really

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,959
kind of learned from them that they wouldn't have anyone in their team that they didn't think was

94
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:50,540
brilliant. And as leaders, they are two of the, probably two of the best people I have ever worked

95
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,519
with in my life. Like there's some great people at Listener as well that I've learned a lot from, but

96
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,839
in particular them. And one of the things that sounds so basic, but it was something that I

97
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,019
really saw from them was how they

98
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:02,079
learned from them.

99
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,060
with kindness. They were, well, they are two of the kindest people and generous people. You can

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,399
find it was all about, you know, how they could get, how they could nurture their team. And then

101
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:24,379
in return, the team is obviously going to work hard for them because they adore them, which is

102
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,100
what's what happened. Everyone is so cohesive together, working so brilliantly. There's,

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,019
in the four years that I was their executive,

104
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:38,459
there was never dramas, no issues. And how you think like there was a team of nine of us,

105
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,040
everyone just works so well together because from the top, it was just led so beautifully. So

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,459
it really, when people started to work for me, I really was, you know, cause I had been in,

107
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,439
in jobs before where, you know, big leaders were managing through fear. And I had learned that too,

108
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,000
like, you've got to be hard on the person and, you know, they're not going to,

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,879
they're not going to do the job properly or they're slack off unless you're a certain way.

110
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,300
And then when I worked with two of Australia's most successful people, I realized that is not

111
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,079
true at all. And it, it really changed the way that I manage people. And it, you know,

112
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,540
they wouldn't have even realized like what an impact it had on me. Not only was it amazing

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,759
to work for them, but then yes, moving forward, I learned so much.

114
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,060
And talking to Andy about that in particular, they're really strategic with that, Sarah.

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,959
Like, as you know, from this world of media,

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and radio and TV that, you know, you and I have been around for a long time now,

117
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,339
it can get incredibly toxic. And there are some horror stories out there of

118
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:45,879
just dysfunction and, and, you know, it's not unique to radio and media, but it's pretty

119
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,160
prevalent and, and, and, and been horrific. And in the building we're sitting in now,

120
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,459
there's some, there's some shocking stories and Hamish and Andy, they, they were set about one,

121
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,600
they wanted to make a great show, but they set about trying to change that by treating people

122
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,279
differently. And, and even talking to you about that, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

123
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,040
and even talking to them both, they, they had some great rules where they were pushing the

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,019
envelope themselves. They never did anything nasty. I love their humor is always, uh, you know,

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,579
done in a way that's really positive, but if they had upset each other, uh, they'll tell me they

126
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,180
wouldn't go back on air in the next break unless they had a heart to heart and sorted it out. So

127
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,459
even if they had to play four songs in a row, they weren't going to start again until they'd

128
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,339
made sure that they were both on the right page again. So they had some discipline, didn't they?

129
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,459
They, they absolutely, like,

130
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,939
it, it's an, it really to watch two people who are so good at their craft, but then as so good

131
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,959
with people, like every meeting would have a planning meeting every week. And the first half

132
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,040
an hour was just made up of chatting. Like literally it was like, no one talks about work.

133
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,660
The half an hour, the nine of us would just chat about what's been going on. Like, and that was

134
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,860
done obviously. So everyone just loosens up a bit and we actually, you know, find out a bit about

135
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,980
what's happening with people and have a laugh as you do with those boys.

136
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,939
Absolutely. Like that even, that was such an interesting way I thought of starting like a

137
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:11,079
planning meeting is for like half an hour is a decent amount of time. We'd literally just talk.

138
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,660
Yeah. Smart, you know, Sarah, isn't it? We, we talk about that in, in the world we're in where,

139
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,639
you know, if you don't, then a lot of people in the meeting don't feel comfortable enough to speak.

140
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,860
And so you get people talking and we talk about like the opportunity to celebrate what's going

141
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,220
well for a start. Cause as you said, that old hierarchical model that you saw and leading

142
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,240
through fear, which has been a pattern in media.

143
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,779
Yeah.

144
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,340
Consistently, it just, it can ruin, generally ruins people's lives because you're unhappy at

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,679
work and it's a model that's just bankrupt really, isn't it? When you see the opposite of it, it's,

146
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,639
it's profound, isn't it?

147
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,320
And how effective the opposite is. Like so much more effective, not only for the team's mental

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,460
health, but how cohesive the team works because working under fear, you're never going to get the

149
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,480
best out of people. And then they're going to, you know, have some sort of breakdown or they're

150
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,860
going to leave eventually.

151
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,480
And say negative things about you and everyone around because you're breeding that kind of

152
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,279
horrible energy or you do it the complete opposite. And I think Hamish and Andy have

153
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,480
people that have worked for them for something like 15 years. You know, that, that is a long

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,820
time to work from, like they've come from their radio show onto their podcast and they do other

155
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,259
bits and pieces as well, but they would never leave the boys. It's interesting when I just,

156
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,200
when a life of greatness got to the stage where it,

157
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,820
it was, it needed, you know, me to put more energy into it and it was getting bigger.

158
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,519
I, after four years made up the decision that I was going to stop producing and I would move

159
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,059
into just hosting. And I thought to myself, and I knew I had to obviously talk to the boys about it,

160
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,500
but I thought to myself, I can't believe I started here thinking, when will they find me out and get

161
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,299
me out of here? Like, you know, full imposter syndrome to now being the one to make the decision

162
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,259
that I need to leave, not because I don't love it. Cause I did,

163
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,840
but because I have to, you know, nurture my podcast. And, you know, like I said,

164
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,080
I recalled a meeting with the two of them. I'll never forget. And I sat with them

165
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,659
and they're like brothers to me. Like they literally were, I would speak to Andy because

166
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,259
he does more of the business side of things like three times a week about stuff to do with the show.

167
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,639
And, um, I started to cry and I was like, you know, I do, you know, cause I also don't know

168
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,559
if I'm making the right decision. I'm like giving up the best EP job, probably in the country with

169
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,200
the best people to like some kind of take a leap of faith.

170
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,799
And I remember Hamish said to me, you know, Sarah, no leaps of faith ever don't work out.

171
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,139
You know, we're so proud of you and we wish you all the best and you have us, you know,

172
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:46,220
backing you all the way. And it's just, you know, to be nurtured like that and then to

173
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,500
exit in such a beautiful way as well. I mean, who could ask for anything more?

174
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,279
It's a great, uh, level of success, isn't it? When those that you work with are so happy for

175
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,559
your next chapter and then create successful people around them. It's probably the greatest

176
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,759
legacy you can have. I would have thought to do what you did. I mean, I want to ask you about,

177
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,580
you were producing Breakfast Radio for a while after you sat in on our show and I understand

178
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,799
you hated it. Yes, I did not like Breakfast Radio.

179
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,039
Didn't work for you. Why was that?

180
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,639
Well, firstly, it was, I didn't, I know that you did it for ages, but the hours were terrible.

181
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,600
So that was the first thing. And I think that's, I think at the time I had a two and a four year

182
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,539
old and not many Breakfast Radio people. And I think that's, I think at the time I had a two

183
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,600
radio producers have that. And I was the only producer cause it was going between Melbourne

184
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,059
and Sydney and I was the only producer in Melbourne. And then, um, there was digital

185
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,960
producers and stuff in the talent world in Melbourne. And it was just, just managing my

186
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,899
children and then work. And, you know, it was 24 seven working on any kind of breakfast show is 24

187
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,000
seven. So then, you know, I would kind of finish and then pick the kids up from like creation,

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,419
this and that, and then have to still be switched.

189
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:06,679
It just, it led to me like hardcore burning out really hardcore burning out. And I just thought

190
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:12,480
to myself, like, what quality of life is this? Like it really, and it's interesting. I'd love

191
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,100
to know how you kind of managed it, but I felt like I had jet lag permanently. And then come

192
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,580
the weekend, it wasn't like that was a savior that then it was like, you were kind of like

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,779
you'd sleep, but then you felt like your brain still felt kind of weird and fuzzy. And I just

194
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,980
realized that the stress plus the hours is not a good combination for anyone.

195
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,179
Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's true. I like getting up early. That's probably how I get out of bed,

196
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,940
still do. Uh, and I could get my head around it because I would be disciplined at the other end

197
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,000
of the day. And really without having an amazing wife, who's the superstar of our family, you know,

198
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,919
if I was juggling probably what you were, I would have, you know, blown up within a handful of

199
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,759
weeks as well. So I did it for 11 years and I look back.

200
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,919
And I think I never used to say to anyone, I was tired. I never once, because I thought if I

201
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,120
concede, then I'm going to leave that. So, so now I feel good. And then when you stop, you went,

202
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:15,720
no, you didn't. And I could never do it again. Once I'd stopped, there was no way in the world,

203
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,179
no amount of money could ever, ever drag you back to doing that.

204
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,080
And you don't look good either. Like if you look back at photos, I can't talk for you,

205
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,600
but I can talk for myself. You kind of don't, because you're eating at all different times.

206
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:34,940
You know, and you're kind of out of whack. So I feel like your mind and your body are not in sync.

207
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:41,000
Your metabolism isn't working properly. It's all, I'm sure if you did it properly and managed it

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
properly, you would be all right. But for me, I didn't really have the experience. I wasn't

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,679
into personal development like I am now. And it all kind of caved in, which was the catalyst

210
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,500
for me changing my life. So really it was like the dark night of the soul that led me to,

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,759
you know, I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to

212
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:58,960
do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

213
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,279
You know, bigger and better things, which I would never take back for anything.

214
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,059
Yeah. There's a saying, isn't it? On the other side of pain is everything that you always wanted,

215
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,940
isn't it? If you can walk through it like you did. And I found that hard too. I love

216
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,379
exercising to start the day and it's almost impossible in breakfast radio.

217
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:16,720
No, no, no. You're not going in the tree.

218
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,539
The alarm's going off. Yeah. You've got to be pretty hardcore if you're doing that and

219
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:26,779
get to the life of greatness and how that did transform you from a challenging time. But I read

220
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:33,620
with interest as a 17 year old, you studied the spiritual side of Judaism. How profound

221
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,419
an impact did that have on you? Yeah. It's funny you say that. I was

222
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:43,820
telling someone about it today. It was interesting because I, you know, wasn't really into religion

223
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,120
and, you know, Judaism is my religion, but it wasn't something that was so, I didn't go to a

224
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,879
Jewish school or anything like that. It wasn't like so hardcore ingrained in me. But I thought

225
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,639
I always had this leaning towards spirituality.

226
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:04,460
And when I got to my later teen years, I thought, okay, well, Kabbalah was kind of making a comeback

227
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,860
because of Demi Moore and Madonna. And I thought, well, why wouldn't I study the Jewish mysticism?

228
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:16,559
Like it's a connection. And so then I tracked down, I asked a few people and I found out there

229
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,679
was this guy, Label Wolf, who is like the biggest, Rabbi Label Wolf, who's the biggest Kabbalah

230
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,580
teacher. Well, definitely in Australia and still like a big one in the, you know, the scheme of

231
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:26,759
the whole world. And I thought, well, why wouldn't I study the Jewish mysticism? And so then I

232
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:33,200
And I just said to him, like, would you be interested in kind of teaching me? And I think

233
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,620
he was really like, okay, who is this girl? She's really doesn't follow the normal Jewish traditions

234
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,779
and stuff, but not many teenage girls come to me and ask if they can do this one-on-one. So,

235
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:50,580
you know, it's so funny in hindsight, seeing where I am now, but for a year, every Sunday,

236
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,360
I used to sit with him, like in Balaclava at his kitchen table. And he would just like read

237
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,580
passages of different Kabbalistic texts. And then we would like, he would tell me about them and

238
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:08,799
we'd kind of break down the meanings. And it was like, I loved it. And I think that definitely

239
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,879
probably was the start of like putting a seed within me that lay dormant for a while, but kind

240
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,460
of was always there that then led me to do other personal development work after I had the dark

241
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,120
night of the soul in the radio job.

242
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,860
I think if you've had the dark night of the soul in radio, maybe I don't express it quite as

243
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,340
articulately.

244
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,019
As you do, but that's fascinating for someone who's not, you know, strict from the Jewish

245
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:37,200
tradition to sit down with a rabbi at 17, most 17 year olds are finding the nearest nightclub

246
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,220
that you can. I mean, that's unique. It must've been something deep within you.

247
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,240
Yeah. And it's funny because my parents are not like that either. So I don't know,

248
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,460
it's not like I was brought up in an environment that is like that. Like if my kids were like that

249
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,860
now, I could completely understand because they hear so much from me. The way that I speak is

250
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,399
very like that, but that, you know, dad's a doctor, like he was, he's all science and

251
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,220
genetics and all that, you know, only things that you can see are real, you know, all that kind of

252
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,779
stuff. So I think it's, you know, I think sometimes you just lean towards things that

253
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:18,200
interest you. And I think also, you know, when we're at school, sometimes I know we get to choose

254
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,019
our subjects in later years, but we're like, you have to do these certain subjects and you don't

255
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,579
like them. And then you kind of, well,

256
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,539
like lack interest in a lot of things. With this idea of like the Kabbalah, it was something that I

257
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:37,400
just became very interested in. And I think sometimes our kids don't have that, you know,

258
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,220
like even my son says to me, and he's only 10, like, oh, when I'm sometimes like just before

259
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,079
school, like I don't want to go to school and this and that, it's boring. And I know, you know,

260
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,759
what kid doesn't say that. And I was honest with him the other day. I said, look, I understand

261
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,839
it is boring. And there are subjects that you don't want to do because they're boring,

262
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,599
but when you get to the older years, you can actually choose some of your subjects.

263
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,380
It becomes really fun, but you don't know these subjects that you think are boring. You might need

264
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,339
them in later life. You may never need them again, but just know that it's like knowledge that's

265
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,960
going into your brain. That is a really good thing. And also it's illegal if you don't go to

266
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,660
school. So you have to go. Here's the boundary at the end. I hope you enjoy it, but bad luck if

267
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,920
you don't. I love the parenting on that. A life of greatness. It's a great

268
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,880
podcast. Congratulations on it. You ask other people, what does it mean to live a life of

269
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,039
greatness? It's what does that mean to you? Oh, I do ask other people that, but definitely,

270
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,460
you know, like we were just saying, compassionate, being compassionate towards people,

271
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,039
having a life of service. That's the biggest thing. And I, you know, I'm sure you feel it

272
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,880
in the work that you do that lights so many people up, even if it's just the commentary part of it,

273
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,039
like people like love that because they are listening to you and you're bringing them joy.

274
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,900
But I think service is a big part of that. Kindness is a big part of that.

275
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,259
Having that all in place and living an authentic life is the biggest thing. And something that like

276
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,380
I think nearly every single person who comes onto the podcast talks about is living a life that's

277
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:20,420
authentic to you is one that not only will be fulfilling for you, but for everyone around you,

278
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,759
because you're not trying to be someone that you're not. And they've done a lot of studies

279
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,619
now that, you know, people that don't live that authentic life and might follow a career because

280
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:36,099
their dad wanted them to follow it or their mom did, or they don't go and, you know, go to that

281
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:40,859
country that they wanted to because their husband didn't want to go or something like that. Like

282
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:48,440
a lot of that happening the whole time during your life can end up in disease at the end of the day,

283
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,059
because you're not living to who you truly are. So having the knowledge about that now,

284
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,039
I think it's so important for anyone that wants to live a life of greatness,

285
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,319
that they live authentically to them. Like even people, you know, someone said to me the other

286
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,619
day, they were complaining about a friend who's doesn't, you know, she's not a good listener and

287
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:14,079
she always kind of makes comments, you know, she has no filter on things. And I said, look,

288
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,519
she's always been like that. And my friend's like, yeah. And I'm like, well, she's living

289
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,880
her authentic truth. You know, she's not pretending to be someone that she's not.

290
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Um, so, you know,

291
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,299
obviously lead with kindness, but I think all of those things encompassed together will lead you to

292
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,059
a life of greatness. I think, you know, really when you're with someone that is being the authentic

293
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,759
self, even if they are, as you said, sometimes annoying, I find those people so easy to deal

294
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:45,279
with because it's the person that's got the mask on trying to be something, but really they're,

295
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,220
you know, and you always find out they're doing different things. And it, yeah, I can imagine

296
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,440
it's incredibly tiring to keep that up all the time. And it sounds simple, doesn't it? I think

297
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,700
find out who you are. I mean, everyone else is taken, so you don't really want to try and, um,

298
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,380
be anyone else, do you? But it's, it's easier said than done. I mean, you, you speak to a lot of

299
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,779
people, uh, who, who live that authentic life. Is there a skill to it or is it something you

300
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,400
discover? Well, I think it's, I think it's something you discover along the way, but you

301
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,900
know, when we're young and I see it with my kids, especially my daughter, it's like, you just want

302
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,359
to be like everyone else. Like you, you know, when we're young, we just want that same top as that.

303
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,019
We want to do the same things.

304
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,819
It's like, well, what do you want to do? And they think they want to do with just what everyone

305
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,359
else is doing. And we're all like that as kids. We just want to fit in. And then when you're older,

306
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:40,119
you realize like, you know, why was I pretending for all these years to like football? I don't

307
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,119
like football. I was pretending to like football because everyone else liked football or something

308
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,220
like that. You know, you know, a lot of people have those realizations where they're like,

309
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:55,000
every week I was going to the games and I never liked it, you know? So what am I going to do

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,740
for myself that I actually really enjoy? And it might be something bizarre that not many other

311
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,539
people do, but you're filling your cup by doing that because you're living your authentic truth.

312
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,519
It's even standing up for things that you believe in. Yeah, they might not be something that everyone

313
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,700
believes in, but at least you're living your truth, you know?

314
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah. And as you said before, I think that, you know, as a parent, you're a mother of two. For us,

315
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,220
it's the thing of overlaying our world onto our kids. And this is what you need to do to be

316
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,900
successful. And this is...

317
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,359
This is what really is missing in my life. So I really want you to get 99 for your ATAR. And I'd

318
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,880
love you to go to university and study this because I didn't do it. And you see the pain

319
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,059
that causes, isn't it? Rather than just, we want to celebrate whatever you are and whatever you

320
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,440
turn out to be is enough. And I think, yeah, that's where a lot of pain comes from. And you're

321
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,180
really passionate, Sarah. I listened to you talk about your passion for meditation and visualization

322
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,500
and daily routines and habits. What does that look like for you?

323
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,839
Yeah. So visualization...

324
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,799
Visualization and meditation has been a big part of my life for a long time. And it really was a

325
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,279
game changer for me, like over a decade ago, because it was the first time that I realized

326
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:11,660
that, wow, I can actually create my desires and bring them into reality with this mental rehearsal

327
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,519
visualization. And as you would know from sport, it's done so often. People do that, like they

328
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,900
don't not train, but they do that in conjunction with training. And they've done so much research

329
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,779
to see that the athlete doesn't...

330
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,099
It's a lot better. Same with musicians. They also, they'll practice, but sometimes

331
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:34,460
to ensure that they weren't getting, you know, as many injuries, if they were like a violinist

332
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,099
or whatever, then they would do the mental rehearsal and they noticed that the person

333
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:44,960
was achieving the same things, doing the combination of both. And I obviously don't

334
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,480
do it for either of those reasons, but I do it in a sense because I want to create this reality in

335
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,799
my life. And it's...

336
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It just works so unbelievably, like that I will go into meditation and most days, I mean,

337
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,519
I do meditation every day, but if I was to do one combined with a visualization,

338
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,200
I will literally in my mind think about something that I want to create. And when I'm doing that,

339
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,779
I raise my energy to... So when I'm visualizing, I'm actually in the scenario that I see myself in.

340
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:24,380
And then it draws those things to me. And I can't tell you the amount of things that

341
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,980
have come out of that.

342
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,420
into my life from doing things like that. And sometimes it takes a while. And sometimes it

343
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:36,819
will take months of doing, visualizing the same thing. And sometimes those things don't come,

344
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,660
but a lot of the time they do. And then I think, you know, not only does it work,

345
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,299
but it gives you that sense of hope, which I think we all need to know that you are kind

346
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:53,180
of creating what you want into your life. So obviously doing that, like I said, if you're

347
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,960
a sports person, you would obviously do the training.

348
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,920
But, you know, for me, if I need to know, I know that, you know, in my eyes open world,

349
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,539
I need to action things as well. So it's a combination of doing both of them that has

350
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,839
just worked so well for me.

351
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,180
There's a great study they did in the US with elite college basketball. And they trained them

352
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,940
for six weeks on free throws, you know, which is something they should shoot 90%, you know,

353
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,700
or thereabouts. And then the second control group, they didn't let them go on the court at all,

354
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,779
but they got a visualization coach to picture themselves,

355
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,559
shooting better free throws. And every time the group that didn't train outperformed the group

356
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,259
that was training. The power of, as you said, it's almost, you know, it's almost scary. And

357
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,599
then you gotta be careful what you wish for because, you know, what you put in there is

358
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,039
inevitably likely to come to fruition.

359
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,579
Yeah, absolutely. And like you said, it can happen with negative things as well.

360
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,279
I mean, the mind is so, it's like, you know, such a gift to us, but can also be such a burden. The

361
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,960
way we use it.

362
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,859
The way we use it is so important. And, you know, the amount, and I'm sure you would know this too,

363
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,640
of athletes that I've spoken to over the years, they say, yes, training is obviously unbelievably

364
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,240
important, having a passion for what you want to do and all that. But that's also using the mind

365
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,200
to be so laser focused that they know that nothing is going to get in their way for them to achieve

366
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,500
their dreams in their sporting careers. And it's the same with everything that we do. Our suffering,

367
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,400
as the Buddha would say, comes from the mind.

368
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,740
So how can we switch that? And it's interesting. I had this guy on my podcast just recently. His

369
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:37,299
name is Bruce Bryan, and he was falsely accused of a murder in America and put in prison for 29

370
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:43,200
years. He literally just got out in April and he's 50. So he was in jail for majority of his life.

371
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,980
And what he did in jail was he started to read all these texts, like he read The Secret.

372
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,819
And he got into, he wasn't a religious man before.

373
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,480
He went in there, but instead of joining a gang, he thought, well, I'm going to like read

374
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,319
scriptures. He said from the Bible, the Torah, the Quran, just everything to fill his mind with

375
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,440
good things. And he said that he would, when he was put in solitary confinement, which was

376
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,059
sometimes for three months, he would sit there and he would just visualize himself in a different

377
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:19,460
place. And he would just go and do it over and over again. And then some nights he thought,

378
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,940
you know, he learned this all in jail, that he read that the subconscious mind should be

379
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,299
filled with good things before you drift off to bed, not negative things, which I know through my

380
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:35,279
work as well. So he said he'd like maybe read a passage from The Secret or a scripture, and he

381
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,240
would be thinking about that before he went to bed. And then obviously he manifested getting out

382
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,460
because this guy that was going to be put in jail for life ended up, someone found out about his

383
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,240
case and, you know, got a great lawyer and they ended up getting him out recently. And now he's,

384
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,960
you know, about to tour the world. And he's going to be put in jail for life.

385
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,599
Speaking and his, you know, his life has changed in such an amazing way, but it was the power of

386
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,559
his mind that kept him sane. He said people were dying around him. They were taking their own life.

387
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,319
There were so many gangs in those American prisons, like they're horrendous. Yet he just

388
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,900
stuck to his guns and it, you know, has turned out brilliantly for him.

389
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,259
Some great people doing incredible things, isn't there, Sarah? It's the beauty of this

390
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,700
format, isn't it? There's stories around and that power, as you said, to,

391
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,720
and as we know ourselves, like you think something horrific that may have not even

392
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,359
happened. And most of the time it hasn't. And you can feel that in your body and that stress and

393
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,160
that sadness comes on immediately. And the reverse is there, isn't it too? As you said to,

394
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,660
I'm picturing a conversation I had with Steve Hooker, the Olympic gold medal pole vaulter. And

395
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,220
he said on that final jump, the biggest moment of his life was the easiest thing he'd done

396
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,359
because he'd seen it so many times that it just, it just happened because he could picture himself

397
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,960
going over the bar. And you're right. People say that in sport easily. They don't,

398
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,619
so much see it in life around, Hey, what is the life I want to live? And as you would describe

399
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:05,339
a life of greatness, you can create that if you understand the power of your mind as,

400
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,859
as you clearly have done in an amazing way. Well, I often use the term, Sarah, like success

401
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:15,339
leaves clues. And someone said that to me in this format, what are the patterns you've picked up?

402
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,420
You've spoken to some fantastic people. What are the synergies that you've picked up from

403
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,400
those people about a great life? Well, I think the biggest one, as we mentioned,

404
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,299
was this, the story of being authentic. And one thing I want to add on that, there was this

405
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,660
beautiful author, her name's Bronnie Ware. She's very well known. And she wrote the famous book,

406
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,980
The Five Regrets of the Dying. And the biggest regret of the dying was that I didn't lead a

407
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:44,759
life that was authentic to myself. So that, as we discussed is obviously a big one. You know,

408
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,380
the whole idea of kindness, I know that sounds like it's such a buzz. It's not even a buzzword,

409
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
but people think it's like,

410
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,960
a nothing thing, but it isn't a nothing thing. Like we touched on with Hamish and Andy, like

411
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,059
being kind can change lives and doing the opposite can also change lives. And you know,

412
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,220
kindness is a ripple effect. You're kind to someone, they become happy. They don't even

413
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,660
realize they're kind to the next person and then the next and then the next. And it's a ripple

414
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,119
effect because everyone gets those drops of kindness. But when you're also not nice to

415
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,400
someone because someone cut you off in the traffic, you know, you're rude then to the

416
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,380
shop assistant who gets upset, who's then rude to her kids when they,

417
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,039
get home, who's then, you know, that also is a cycle as well. So, you know, I think that's a big

418
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,660
one and, you know, having purpose and meaning in your life is huge. Like, you know, I always knew

419
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,839
that I wanted to be in media and I, you know, kind of started out there and then did marketing

420
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,119
for a period of time and then moved back into media. And I remember when I started working for

421
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:53,000
SEA and it was like, this is, it was like one of the, at that time was one of the best moments.

422
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,480
Like I've just come back to like what I feel like is home. And I'm like so passionate about

423
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,720
the media industry and entertainment. And I just felt like me after spending years in corporates,

424
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,539
in marketing, it just didn't feel quite right. And then, you know, that even though it was like,

425
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,819
you know, jobs doing activations, I just got so much joy out of that. And it just gave me this

426
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:23,380
sense of like, I woke up in the morning feeling like, wow, like I've got me,

427
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,259
and purpose in the world. Like this is, it just is such a different feeling than walking through

428
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:35,779
life feeling like you just, you know, you're not happy with where everything's gone or your job or

429
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:43,259
anything like that. That I think is just a huge, huge thing as well. So, you know, having all those

430
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,799
things, I think creates a really great life. We were talking, Sarah, before we started about

431
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,839
Bali, you've been up there recently and we've been lucky enough to spend a lot of time up there at

432
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,500
the North retreat at Sukhavati Bali. And you always, I always feel like it's a life lesson

433
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,640
when I'm around the Balinese. You walk amongst them and they're laughing constantly and they're

434
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,900
smiling. And I was watching them when I was up there a couple of weeks ago and some of the guys

435
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,500
were putting together this bed and one of them sort of picked up a plank of wood and it hit the

436
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,099
other one in the head. Now you'd be, you know, right to sort of turn around and give a, like,

437
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,200
he laughed immediately and they all laughed because it was an accident, you know, whereas

438
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,339
on a work site here, you could imagine that would.

439
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,579
It'd be a tense five minutes and you mightn't speak to someone. And one of our guests that was

440
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:32,759
checking in on the way in the car, she'd said, seen, you know, you, you, you watch families

441
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,539
for on a motorbike and there was a husband and wife clearly, and they had these crates

442
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:44,740
of like teacups or a stack, like six high. She was driving to our retreat. Someone cut

443
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,220
the motorbike off, the crates fell and they smashed on the ground. And she did that. How bad,

444
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,380
you know, like, and she stopped and waiting, you know, and they got,

445
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,500
and they laughed and they laughed and like, and she was like, it's smashed. Like you can't do

446
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,559
anything about it, you know, and you could go and, you know, have road rage here in Australia

447
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,880
or they realize that that person didn't really mean to do anything bad to them. It was an accident

448
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,539
that happened. And, but it's hard to live that in the moment, isn't it?

449
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:15,700
It's the interpretation of our environment is huge. Like at the end of the day,

450
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,400
things can happen. Like if there's war in a country and you're in that country, of course,

451
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,319
you're going, that's horrendous. Your external world is controlling,

452
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,059
what's going on to an extent, but we have control over our mind. Only we do. And that

453
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:36,079
Bruce Bryan is like the guy in jail. That is a perfect example of that. And what you'd said

454
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:44,019
before about in Bali, like how they interpreted those accidents was up to them. They decided

455
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:48,480
they're going to interpret it in a positive way. I mean, how much better is that than if it's all

456
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,240
just like, oh my God, I can't believe this. And, you know, it's a, we're in control of that. No

457
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,500
one else, like someone can be mean to you, but it's your interpretation of that and how you let

458
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,420
it affect you that then rules. They can't affect you. They can say things, but you can be like

459
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:12,480
Teflon and it just, you know, wipes off. So I think that that has just been a big learning that

460
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,420
we have the power to control how we perceive or envisage the world and, you know, the people that

461
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,900
come into it. Do you believe in luck? No.

462
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,760
You don't?

463
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:29,960
No. I believe that we, well, I don't know. Cause I think we create it all. So I don't believe like,

464
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,059
you know, you know, if someone was to say like, oh, you're so lucky you get to work at this great

465
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:40,760
media company. I would think like, oh no, I created that for myself. You know? So I think

466
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,019
like luck is like things just happen randomly. And I don't think that things do.

467
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,699
Yeah. I understand. I slightly differ from you on that. I feel like being born in this country in

468
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,019
Australia.

469
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,679
There's enormous luck. And I don't think I played any role in that or having the mom and dad that I

470
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:04,619
was lucky enough to be born into that family. I feel like, but I'm with you on the opportunity

471
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,960
to take what those moments are and turn them into something greater. But yeah, I think you've

472
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,760
articulated that ability better than almost anyone. We see these patterns around what great

473
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,440
leadership Sarah is, what I'm really passionate about, what it looks like in different standing.

474
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,219
I love your story. Having seen you in the early days, you've been a great leader. You've been a

475
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:29,420
to creating this beautiful life, which is an amazing story. But we think one of the dimensions

476
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,019
is the idea of self-leadership. That it's really hard to lead anyone else without the sense for

477
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:43,239
yourself. I imagine that's pretty clear for you. Yes. So for me, it comes back to what we've been

478
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,139
speaking about. The kindness thing is obviously a big deal, but then it's not just in the workplace.

479
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:53,199
It's the way that I live my life normally. But setting myself up to do that every day,

480
00:35:53,239 --> 00:36:01,780
like the meditation that we talked about, the visualization, the gratitude. I will take time

481
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,780
out of my day to think about what I'm grateful for. People can easily write that down, but I just

482
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,219
kind of put my hand on my heart sometimes or lie there after my meditation thinking about what I'm

483
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:20,219
grateful for. And all those things give me energy as well as things like sport and stuff like that

484
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,219
and making sure I eat well.

485
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:30,639
Because I think people think, oh, eat well, sport, sleep, that's important. But those are

486
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:36,639
crucial elements to living a great life and being a great leader. Because if you're not doing those

487
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:42,219
sort of things and you're not fueling the body in the right way, you're not allowing the body and

488
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:48,539
mind to rest overnight for eight hours, then you'll see cracks in the way that you go about

489
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,219
your leadership for yourself and for other people as well.

490
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:59,199
Sleep is an unbelievable one. Because I know for myself, when I don't get enough of that,

491
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,300
I can start to really feel that my emotions start taking over in a way that they wouldn't usually.

492
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:12,539
And they now know that we sleep things like Alzheimer's disease and heart disease. A lot

493
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:20,519
of the triggers for those are coming from people who are lacking in sleep. So I think all those

494
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,219
things set me up to lead people well.

495
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:30,940
And to be a good, you know, lead people well, lead myself well, which then flows through to them as

496
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,239
well.

497
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:36,739
Yeah, talk about people who, you know, don't get enough sleep. It's sort of akin to, you know,

498
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,820
almost worse than being an alcoholic or some forms of cancer. That's how important that part of your

499
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,860
life is, isn't it? To be able to understand. There's very few that can get away with the

500
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,219
decent amount of sleep that we know. Positively impacting people in their environment.

501
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:58,099
Sarah, we see a really common pattern around people have great lives, and I'm sure that

502
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,760
resonates with you. How would you describe having an impact in a positive way?

503
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,800
Well, you know, especially with the people that, you know, are in my team, I, you know, again,

504
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,199
I think I got this from Hamish and Andy, and it's so basic, but when they're doing good work,

505
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:19,860
I tell them that they're doing good work. I tell them that I appreciate them. I don't do the

506
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,219
opposite, thinking like, oh, if I appreciate them too much, then maybe they're going to be

507
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,579
they'll, um, you know, I don't know. You can't over-appreciate, can you?

508
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:34,380
Exactly. Exactly. You know, it's, it's little things like that. Um, again, something I learned

509
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,199
from the boys, like actually at Christmas time, buying them something nice. It's their birthday,

510
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,539
celebrating their birthday. These are all such little things, but they all make such a big

511
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:49,820
difference. Being an ear for them if they need to talk. I mean, there was someone that was,

512
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,199
that works for me that was really having a hard time the other day and called me and said,

513
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:59,519
and we just chatted about their personal life and I gave them any help that I could and any

514
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,599
resources that I thought would help them along the way. Like you have to lead with compassion

515
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,059
and you have to be real when you lead too. Like I, I don't, you know, you don't want to be a

516
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:15,099
bumbling mess. You obviously, but at the same time, I think when you're a leader and you do

517
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:20,619
show that you're a human and, and you have emotions, that is a big thing too, because it

518
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:23,179
allows them to realize that they too can change. And I think that's a big thing too, because it

519
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,599
allows them to show that. And I remember years ago, I interviewed Simon Sinek and he was very,

520
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,800
he's obviously a leadership expert. And he was saying like during COVID, he's not going to

521
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,920
pretend that he's not suffering to his team. He was suffering. And people would reach out to ask

522
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,800
him if he was okay, the same way that he would do the same. So I think it's that whole idea of

523
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,420
realizing that you're all human, you're not robots and that you need to treat people in a respectful

524
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,179
manner and be a human. And I think that's a big thing too. And I think that's a big thing too.

525
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,739
Be compassionate and know that sometimes they are doing long hours and maybe that means that

526
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:02,440
they don't work the next day or they start later. It's just little things like that. So they don't

527
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,820
feel like they're a number rather than a person. Yeah. And people pick fake too, don't they?

528
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,920
They pick when you're, you know, dialing in and not really mean it. It's, you know,

529
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,659
authentic's a word you've used more than any other word, I think in this podcast and it certainly

530
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:23,179
resonates. And I think you can't fake it. People genuinely understand whether you really care or

531
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:27,900
you don't. Creating and sharing a vision is something we talk about a lot and you've had a

532
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,800
really clear vision, it seems Sarah, for this life you've created. And I love it. It's such a great

533
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,480
story. How have you gone about that? Well, I think, you know, basically I had the idea for

534
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,199
the podcast after I had the dark night of the soul in the radio job. Well, I didn't, I actually,

535
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,159
that's when I got into personal development work. I started working for the boys and then I

536
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,079
was engrossing myself in personal development work.

537
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,699
I started doing a lot of writing and I thought, why wouldn't I just do a podcast about this? And

538
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:04,880
it was six years ago nearly. And I thought like, I'm so well versed in this area. I can just

539
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,940
interview people who, you know, I've been teaching people how to interview for many years now.

540
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,860
Why wouldn't I just start something? And that's how that kind of took off. And then from there,

541
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:22,480
it's like, you know, courses and, you know, supplementary podcasts and doing speaking and

542
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,179
keynote talk.

543
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:30,079
And, um, you know, live shows and things like that. It just, one thing I'm sure you have these

544
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,320
two, you'll do one thing and that will give you an idea for something else that will give you an

545
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,420
idea for something else. And then it, it goes forward from there. But I think one thing is,

546
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,019
is, is how can I help others has been one of the biggest mantras and how can I be of service that

547
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:50,300
I say every morning, every morning I say, how can you know, use me for service, use me for service.

548
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,639
And how can I,

549
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,440
within my writing, within the conversations I'm having, how can I help other people?

550
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,480
Cause I find when you do that, um, not only do you feel good, you know, that you're helping them,

551
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:09,099
they feel good. And, you know, that comes straight back to you. It's this like beautiful,

552
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:16,139
like synergy and that kind of spurs on more work. And, um, it's this beautiful cycle. So

553
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:21,460
everything I do, I lead with, you know, how can I serve? How can I help others? How can I educate

554
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,179
more people?

555
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,360
So that they can live the greatest life.

556
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,880
Yeah. Beautifully said. They talk about that. The highest form of living, isn't it? Being in

557
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,300
service to others. And that is really, uh, when people are at their peak, when you're genuinely

558
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,840
giving, not because you're wanting it back, but because you, that's, that's what your purpose is

559
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,059
in life.

560
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:41,340
Like nothing for me is more important than getting those like emails from people or,

561
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:47,519
um, you know, messages on social media or things like that, where you know that you've made a

562
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,619
difference in someone's life. Like I find, I don't think I'll ever get sick of that. Like,

563
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,920
that fills my cup up more than anything else.

564
00:42:55,219 --> 00:43:01,940
Yeah. Well done. Curiosity is where we hear a lot of in, in this space and through being curious,

565
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,820
that's how people get their learning and development and that constant sense of

566
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,360
self-improvement. Does curiosity ring true with you?

567
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,179
Yeah. I've always been curious about everything in life. And I also, you know, that I think the

568
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:19,019
podcast was good for this. I was always like, I'm not just going to follow one, like, you know,

569
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:22,619
sometimes people follow just like one lead or one thought leader or something like that.

570
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,739
Or one author. And I always thought, you know, I just want to get a bit of everything and then

571
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:33,420
make up my own mind because no one's way is better than the next person's way. So having that

572
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,619
curiosity to always seek out new thought leaders, read new books, um, I'm constantly doing those

573
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,940
things. And I feel that that's really enriched me. It's given me the knowledge about different

574
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,579
areas, but it's also allowed me to just stay curious about life because things evolve as

575
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:52,619
well.

576
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,239
Like, you know, the ancient scriptures usually have it right and things always relate back to

577
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:03,000
them. But at the same time, when you're talking about neuroscience and, um, the way the brain

578
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,699
works, like we're just finding out new things every day about that. And so like, okay, how can

579
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:13,199
we use that in a way that allows us to live a better life? And I think we know always need to

580
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:19,480
be curious, um, and always question things as well. Like, you know, it just because someone

581
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,380
said it doesn't always mean that it's right. Or maybe there's another avenue.

582
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,440
That's always been something that I've really, really been big on, you know?

583
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,679
You're not being rigid, rigid in your thinking and being open-minded. And sometimes you can

584
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:34,440
change the thought, can't you? Because you hear it in a different way. And, uh, yeah,

585
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,460
putting your, uh, your mind into that space is, is interesting. Communicating with clarity.

586
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,980
And that's, you know, pretty much what you do, Sarah, very clear about living this life of

587
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,340
greatness and you work with great communicators and this has been the world you wanted in media.

588
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,320
Have you thought really strongly about the way that you've been communicating with people?

589
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,340
Well, it's funny because over the years in different, like, you know, in the,

590
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,780
in the radio roles I've had, or in the producing roles I've had, people always said,

591
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:09,119
you're very matter of fact. And I, and I, it's always, it's my authentic self. So I think my

592
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,460
mom is quite matter of fact as well, but I've never noticed it until other people were saying

593
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,039
that. So, you know, obviously I'm being authentic. Um, you know, I don't bullshit. That's the

594
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,159
biggest thing, clearly. But what I've learned over the years is to make sure that like, I don't,

595
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,579
I'm not too matter of fact. Um, cause you know, there's a lot of people, they do it in such a

596
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,860
nice way with all these pleasantries. And then it's like, get to the point of where are we going

597
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,960
whilst I'm straight to the point. And that's what Hamish and Andy loved about me. They were like,

598
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,079
you're so matter of fact, like we just know, know how it is. Um, but I have been working on

599
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,340
thinking about that before, you know,

600
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,000
I say something to deliver information or all that kind of stuff. Cause you matter of fact is

601
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,039
good because it's authentic and you're not, people don't walk away thinking like, I don't know what

602
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,280
they're talking about, or I'm really confused, but at the same way, you need to do it with kindness.

603
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,500
Well, I love the self-reflection, isn't it? It's not understanding yourself, isn't it? And then

604
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,099
you can maybe add a bit of nuance to, to the way you communicate. How important has collaboration

605
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:16,579
been for you, Sarah? Oh, it's so important. And you know, it's a, it's a funny thing. Cause I

606
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,019
think in our world, sometimes people get scared to collaborate.

607
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:25,539
Like not just having a guest on a podcast, but you know, maybe doing courses together or

608
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:31,900
sharing information or I don't know, um, doing events together or something like that. And

609
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:38,800
it's interesting cause they're like, this is my patch. And, um, you know, I, if we bring the

610
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,760
worlds together, God forbid your audience would know about my stuff or something like that.

611
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,039
But you realize that that's not the way. And being in that scarcity mindset is only going to give you

612
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,840
more of that within your life.

613
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,800
And I think collaborations are the most beautiful thing. Like being able to expose

614
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,539
your knowledge to more people and their knowledge to your audience. And it really like lifts the

615
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:06,760
both of you up. And it really, it's an audience thing. Like you just get out to so many more

616
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,119
people. It's, it's wonderful. Like, you know, if you're collaborating with the right people

617
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,380
who, um, you know, you believe in their work and all that kind of stuff. And you think that they

618
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,019
could be, um, helpful to the people that, that, you know,

619
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:23,099
you are your audience too, then I think it's a wonderful thing.

620
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,780
Yeah. If there's shared values, isn't there? And you, and that abundance mindset is,

621
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,780
is such a healthier way again, isn't it? That there is enough, there is enough going on.

622
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,420
There's always enough.

623
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,940
In whatever area you're in. It's, uh, yeah, I think people have that, uh,

624
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,980
fear all the time, isn't it? Someone's opening up a restaurant next to mine. Well,

625
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,519
perhaps that just brings more people.

626
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,039
Exactly. Exactly. It's the interpretation.

627
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,840
Yeah. Always. Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

628
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,179
Who's been the greatest leader?

629
00:47:51,380 --> 00:48:00,260
Look, I think, you know, I, I think, you know, the, my dad is someone who I've always like

630
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:06,480
looked up to. I mentioned that he's a doctor, but he was always, you know, he's a very kind man.

631
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:13,199
Um, and he's, he always looking at him, you know, he never will say a bad word about anyone.

632
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,780
He's very funny as well. Uh, but he's very caring too. And so, you know, I grew up

633
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,360
seeing that. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's,

634
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:29,619
and my mother is exactly the same. She also is like that, but it was nice to be nurtured by people

635
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:36,059
that, you know, were their authentic selves and were kind and led in a way, you know,

636
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,780
they led the family in a way that allowed us to blossom. I mean, you know, I don't know if dad's

637
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,119
listened to one episode of my podcast, but mom listens to every single episode. Um, but that's

638
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,340
okay. He doesn't need to be on the same wavelength as I am. Cause we're not, we're very different.

639
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:59,179
But, you know, it's just seeing the way that he's led his life, um, and being very successful at what

640
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:04,659
he does has made me realize again, similar to Hamish and Andy, that you can lead like that

641
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:09,840
and be able to, you know, have abundance and love around you.

642
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,659
But you know, he's there and you know,

643
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,300
Absolutely. So proud.

644
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,219
Yeah. So he should, so he should be. I mean, you've had some great collaborations and it's

645
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,000
a great achievement on your podcast.

646
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,420
It's turned up in different lights, but you know, we mentioned Simon Sinek and, um, Deepak Chopra

647
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,019
was brilliant. Incredible. Jay Shetty, you've collaborated with great people on your podcast.

648
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,500
Is there one person that you've thought that's the person I'd love to, not necessarily on your

649
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,219
podcast, but in life in general, I'd love to collaborate with one person in general. Is there,

650
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,739
is there a name that springs to mind?

651
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,519
To be like, I've had so many of them. Like it was, it would have been Deepak a few months ago.

652
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,139
And then I had him and it was, it was, he was amazing.

653
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,699
Um, you know, there's always, it's funny, but I have had a few musicians on,

654
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,039
and I know this is a completely different area. I love people that have really good life stories

655
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,280
and I've followed Bruce Springsteen for a long time. And then, you know, he's done podcasts

656
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,679
with Obama and I remember listening to them a while ago, especially when I was starting a

657
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,820
podcast with Josh Frydenberg, when he was the treasurer, I listened to that cause he did it

658
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,199
with Obama and I thought, Oh, it'd be good to hear kind of like what they bantered about and stuff.

659
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:25,380
And he is such a super interesting guy. Um, all these songs come from, you know,

660
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,900
deep meaning within his life. You know, I'd love to collaborate with someone like him.

661
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:36,699
Um, there's, I think in the personal development world, I think I've nearly ticked everyone off.

662
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,079
Um, there's always people that come up, but I think the people that I've wanted the most

663
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,880
have been on. So, you know, there's always interesting people within the entertainment

664
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,500
space or the sports space, um, that,

665
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,179
you know, you think, Oh God, that would be good. You know, it'd be interesting to get into their

666
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:01,880
mind and, and, um, see how they tick. But Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, people like that. I

667
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,800
mean, I love them. I reckon the boss that jumps out, doesn't it? Love to see you sitting down

668
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,659
from the boss and I would not back against you making that happen. I can see that in your

669
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:16,719
visualization coming to fruition. Congratulations. I love your story. It's, um, you can see living a

670
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,360
life of purpose and greatness, which as I said at the start, uh, if you haven't listened to Sarah's

671
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,599
work, I encourage you to do it. And the wisdom you're passing on to others is an incredible

672
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,460
contribution. Thanks for taking the time. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to the
