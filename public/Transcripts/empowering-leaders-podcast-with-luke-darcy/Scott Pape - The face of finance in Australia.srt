00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:10,560
How does a humble country boy become the face of finance in Australia?

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,740
And how do you stay true to yourself on the back of life-changing success?

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,000
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,899
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

5
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,660
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,579
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,320
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,500
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,460
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,920
where everyone has a voice.

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,500
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

12
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,759
Scotty Pape, known as the Barefoot Investor,

13
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,739
has changed the paradigm completely for how millions of Australians think

14
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,560
and manage their personal finances.

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,700
His book, The Barefoot Investor,

16
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,480
the only money guide you'll ever need,

17
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,959
is the highest ever selling book in Australian history

18
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,340
with over 2 million copies sold.

19
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,340
His follow-up book, The Barefoot Investor,

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,079
for families, is also a number one bestseller.

21
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,879
Scott's leadership in lobbying state and federal MPs

22
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,780
to overhaul financial literacy in schools

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,359
has put that issue firmly on the agenda.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
Scotty Pape's positive contribution

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,099
to the financial health and education of millions of Australians

26
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,379
is a great story of passion and leadership.

27
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,159
Welcome to the Empowering Leadership Podcast, Pape.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,799
Thanks for joining me.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,939
Thank you, Dars.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,280
Now, I've got to say, I'm not sure why I'm here.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,540
First point, I rarely do,

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,579
I don't do podcast interviews.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,299
I rarely do radio interviews anymore.

34
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't do television interviews.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,659
And this is a show about leadership.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,099
And I've got to tell you, I know nothing about leadership.

37
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm going to put it right there.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,019
The only reason I'm here is because you are one of the most genuinely lovely people

39
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,539
that I've worked with throughout my career.

40
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,460
And I mean that.

41
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,000
We've worked together for nearly a decade.

42
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,939
So I'm here for you, buddy,

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,500
but I'm a little concerned because I could stuff this up for you.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,479
Well, very kind of you.

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,159
I'll say that, mate,

46
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,819
because I see your life story as ultimate leadership

47
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,280
in the world that you operate in.

48
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:28,860
And as I'm talking to you and answering that comment,

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,319
and very nice of you to say it,

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,960
but I'm thinking about an interview we did on this podcast

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,340
with Brian McNamee, who was the CEO of CSL.

52
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,919
Great story, I'm sure you're aware of,

53
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,620
transforming that company into Australia's largest company.

54
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,280
And he spoke about on the podcast, Pape,

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,139
that everyone gets a couple of cards in life,

56
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,520
and it's how you play those cards

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,639
that determines you a lot.

58
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,919
I reckon you got your cards,

59
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,159
you know them well,

60
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,240
and you play them well.

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,379
Is that a fair assessment?

62
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeah, I think so.

63
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,819
I mean, one of the things,

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,719
one of the sort of the turning points for me,

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,360
there's a couple,

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,500
but the main one was when I started,

67
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,699
I started on a little student radio station

68
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,719
trying to make money sort of interesting for young people

69
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,759
about 20 years ago.

70
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,900
Because everything from that point

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,039
was actually written for older people.

72
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,280
And I remember, you know, getting really excited

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,740
and I went back to, went back home and dad said,

74
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,199
you know, no matter what you do, don't be a wanker.

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,219
Look after the battlers.

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,539
You know, I'm a kid from Oyen.

77
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,139
You know, no one ever came to Oyen.

78
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,879
So he's like, you know, just make sure that, you know,

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,460
you don't get too ahead of yourself

80
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,139
and write for those people.

81
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,780
And I guess that's kind of one of the things

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,620
that I've tried to do.

83
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Great advice that is from,

84
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,280
man, you're always on, mate.

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,719
The phone's going.

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,300
I like that.

87
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,620
And I might've had a family call.

88
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,819
So let me know if we need to pause and sort that out.

89
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,199
But mate, from there, from community radio,

90
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,500
effectively into selling the highest ever selling book

91
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,460
in Australian history,

92
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,199
passing 50 Shades of Grey and Harry Potter.

93
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,219
It's an extraordinary story of success.

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,819
So what do you think about that success

95
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:09,680
when you're sitting here now?

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,620
It's a little overwhelming, to be honest.

97
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,639
I mean, I sat there when I first wrote the book.

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,500
I thought to myself,

99
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,480
no one really,

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,720
buys books anymore.

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,399
No one reads books.

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,199
We're all online.

103
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,339
So I wrote this book.

104
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,480
I thought if I'm going to do it,

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm going to write this book

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,399
like I would be sitting at the bar with my mate,

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,699
just telling him exactly, you know, what I do.

108
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,139
You know, so sketching out on the back of a coaster.

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,259
Here are the buckets that I use.

110
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,980
You know, here's the accounts that I use.

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,480
Here is the pillows that I buy.

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,139
All these random stuff.

113
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
So I wrote it.

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,480
And then I sent it off to the publisher.

115
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,620
And they're like,

116
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,779
this is actually pretty good.

117
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,259
They didn't think because I'd written for the newspaper

118
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,660
for like 15 years,

119
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,019
they sort of thought,

120
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,399
oh, you know, you've got a bit of a following.

121
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,740
Let's just throw out a book.

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,860
But when they read it,

123
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,339
they're like, you know,

124
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,540
this probably could sell 20,000 copies.

125
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,779
Like this could be really good.

126
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,000
And then I remember the first week it sold,

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,680
like we had a pre-order thing and it had like 80,000

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,220
copies in the weekend.

129
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,860
And I'm like, wow, this is big.

130
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,779
And then it just became a,

131
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,459
uh,

132
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,220
I think they've called it Australia's largest finance cult

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,699
or something.

134
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,740
And it grew into something pretty crazy.

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,720
Where did those,

136
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,120
you know,

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,579
I suppose to me,

138
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,980
the thing I've always noticed and loved about you,

139
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,319
Papi,

140
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,459
is that your values are really strong.

141
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,779
You could have commercialized so many aspects of what you

142
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,220
do,

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,180
but being fiercely independent has always been that part of

144
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,259
you.

145
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,699
Where did that value come from?

146
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:40,339
Yeah,

147
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,120
I do think it came back to sort of mum and dad

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,480
saying,

149
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,740
you know,

150
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,459
that,

151
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:44,959
you know,

152
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,480
you've got to look after,

153
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:46,899
you know,

154
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:47,220
just,

155
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,519
you know,

156
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,459
tread your own path.

157
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,100
Sort of thing.

158
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,300
Yeah.

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,620
And so for me,

160
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,300
I distinctly remember,

161
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,620
um,

162
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,839
we'd sold it.

163
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,720
It just cracked over a million copies and I went for

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,899
dinner with my wife and we had it got a babysitter

165
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,899
and it was like a celebration because we never thought I

166
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,399
never thought I would sell a million copies.

167
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,480
And she said,

168
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,720
you know,

169
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,620
what's next.

170
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,199
And at that time that was right at the peak of it.

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,459
Right.

172
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,160
So I had,

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,819
you know,

174
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,899
people wanting me to do,

175
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,439
um,

176
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,620
uh,

177
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,759
managed funds,

178
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,899
hedge funds,

179
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,279
um,

180
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,399
financial planning.

181
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,079
The whole range of things that I could do.

182
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,000
Like people were,

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,899
we just had a list of people wanting to offer me stuff.

184
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:25,139
And,

185
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,279
and this serious commercial opportunities,

186
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,160
like millions and millions of dollars.

187
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,540
And like an estimate.

188
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:31,839
I mean,

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
if you went down that path,

190
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
you're talking tens and tens of millions.

191
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,779
Yeah.

192
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,779
It could have been very,

193
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,639
it could have been really,

194
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,579
really lucrative.

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,000
Um,

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,579
for me,

197
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,000
did you think about it for a moment?

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,319
No,

199
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,019
I did not.

200
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,180
I actually didn't.

201
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,680
Um,

202
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,439
because I didn't realize that the book was going to become this big.

203
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,439
And it was almost like,

204
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,360
when it did,

205
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,779
it was,

206
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,279
it was,

207
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,740
um,

208
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,519
a little bit,

209
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:51,879
um,

210
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm pretty humble,

211
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,279
sort of a dude,

212
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,439
you know,

213
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,439
I just live on a farm and it was a little overwhelming to be honest,

214
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,240
you know,

215
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,839
to be sort of a household name.

216
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,079
It was quite overwhelming.

217
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,920
Um,

218
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,500
but you know,

219
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,519
I,

220
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,759
so I sat down with my wife and she's like,

221
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,519
what are you going to do?

222
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,360
And I said,

223
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,560
you know,

224
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,540
I think I'm going to go to TAFE and I think I'm going to do,

225
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,379
um,

226
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:10,699
uh,

227
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,959
become a financial counselor.

228
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,839
So basically a social worker who helps people that don't have any money,

229
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:16,740
um,

230
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,620
manage their money.

231
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,420
And,

232
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,199
and she's like,

233
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,740
um,

234
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
do you get paid for that?

235
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,100
And I'm like,

236
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,699
fair question.

237
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,480
No,

238
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,680
no,

239
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,079
you don't.

240
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,519
But we've earned a lot of money through the books,

241
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,600
so we probably don't need to.

242
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,040
And so,

243
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,519
yeah,

244
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:28,980
at the,

245
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,939
at the height of it,

246
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:30,519
I,

247
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,800
I handed back my Australian financial services license.

248
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,680
Um,

249
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,819
I went to TAFE.

250
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,579
I did this course as a,

251
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,360
as a student,

252
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,660
I learned to become a,

253
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
what is basically a social worker,

254
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,480
like a financial counselor.

255
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,420
So if you are in trouble,

256
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:45,800
uh,

257
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,220
you've,

258
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,480
you know,

259
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,699
you don't have enough money to,

260
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,319
to pay,

261
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,160
to pay your bills,

262
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,300
you can ring up the National Debt Helpline on 1-800-007-007.

263
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,360
You talk to someone like me and I'll sit down and try and talk to your bank.

264
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,779
Um,

265
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,459
it could be a farmer who's struggling.

266
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,480
It could be somebody who's got a terminal illness.

267
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,860
It could be someone that's been caught up in a scam,

268
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,819
or it could just be someone who's a single mom.

269
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,240
Who's just had a re who's those cards didn't fall the right way.

270
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,819
And so what I do,

271
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,399
um,

272
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,300
is sit down and help them get themselves out of debt.

273
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,500
And so for me,

274
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:15,860
you know,

275
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,259
I thought that that was a good use of my,

276
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,139
my time and I've sort of tried to promote that service because you know,

277
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,459
as we've spoken about before,

278
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,459
we live in a day in an age where we have some of the highest household debts in

279
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,500
the world.

280
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,320
So for me,

281
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,059
that was really important to try and help those people who have really been

282
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,019
left behind with this current boom that we've had.

283
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,940
And you started this podcast saying,

284
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,220
I'm not sure why I'm here.

285
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,879
I don't see myself as a leader.

286
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,179
And what you just said is,

287
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,519
as I said to you as the ultimate leadership,

288
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:45,919
isn't it?

289
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,259
Where you could really go on a path.

290
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:48,539
And,

291
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:48,799
uh,

292
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,559
and make as much money as you wanted to with your reputation.

293
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,500
And you've decided to go down the full time social worker path.

294
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,720
I mean,

295
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,679
I don't think you can get more leadership than that paper.

296
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,360
And it's an industry,

297
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,799
your industry,

298
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,259
the finance industry that's littered with kickbacks littered with people giving

299
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,799
advice who are maybe not upfront.

300
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,679
Is that something you realized at a young age as well when you were entering

301
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,220
this space?

302
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,379
Not really,

303
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:15,259
because I was always really interested in,

304
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,500
uh,

305
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,519
like my old man,

306
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,759
um,

307
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,259
quit school when he's 14 or 15.

308
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:18,759
And he,

309
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,759
I think if he had it,

310
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,019
if he,

311
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,019
if the cards had been dealt differently for him,

312
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,019
he would have done what I've done.

313
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,019
Like he always wanted to go into finance,

314
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,259
but he never really,

315
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:28,759
uh,

316
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,019
never really got that opportunity as a country boy.

317
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:31,759
So for me,

318
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,759
he was always like,

319
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,759
I had mates whose dads would get him up out of bed on a Sunday

320
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,019
and tinker with a car.

321
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,259
And he became a mechanic.

322
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,259
My dad was always getting me to learn about shares.

323
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:40,759
He was,

324
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,259
you know,

325
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,259
paying me in shares,

326
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:42,759
you know,

327
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,759
one little BHP share.

328
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,259
So he sort of fostered that,

329
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:45,759
um,

330
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,759
that sort of,

331
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,259
uh,

332
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,259
idea in my head.

333
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,460
So I was always really interested,

334
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,259
but kind of in a way of demystifying it for the everyday person.

335
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,659
So that community radio show that I did was like,

336
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:58,960
hang on,

337
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,059
everything's for older people.

338
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,059
Nothing's for younger people.

339
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm going to try and do it.

340
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,360
But what I worked out quite early on was that the parents of the kids were listening because they're like,

341
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,759
actually,

342
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,659
I understand what this guy's talking about.

343
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,360
It actually makes sense.

344
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,659
And so what I've tried to do in my career,

345
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,259
same with the book is just to pitch,

346
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,159
uh,

347
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,860
my mate,

348
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,759
sitting next to me,

349
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,960
who's a smart dude,

350
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,860
really smart dude.

351
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,159
He just doesn't know anything about finance.

352
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,259
He just doesn't have all the,

353
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,659
the terms and try and explain it to him in a way that makes sense.

354
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,059
And I'm not going to do something dodgy to my mate.

355
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:31,360
You know,

356
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,860
I'm not going to give him crap information.

357
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm just going to tell him what I do.

358
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,460
And that's something that I've tried to do in my career.

359
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,059
Because a lot of us aren't born with the finance cards.

360
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,159
We do other things.

361
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,759
And so to have that trusted provider,

362
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,259
and I think it's one of the great assets in life.

363
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,759
When you find someone I ultimately trust,

364
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,559
everything Scott Pape does.

365
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,860
And I think that maybe is,

366
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,360
you know,

367
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
your plain language and your point of difference,

368
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,659
isn't it?

369
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,759
Is that trust is there really,

370
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,259
uh,

371
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,860
really intensely.

372
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,559
So you,

373
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:58,759
you,

374
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,259
you mentioned your dad,

375
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,860
you're probably living what he wanted to do.

376
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
You're a father of four now,

377
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,759
uh,

378
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,759
Papey.

379
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,759
They're going to have a different upbringing than you had now,

380
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,259
given the success that you had.

381
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,259
How do you teach those values to them now with you,

382
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,960
you are a household name and you've been an extraordinary success.

383
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,559
I know you've just gone on a trip around Australia.

384
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,460
I'd love to talk to you about that.

385
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,059
Yeah.

386
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,559
How do you teach those values?

387
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:19,860
Well,

388
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,159
I mean,

389
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,360
you know,

390
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,059
part of,

391
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,759
I live on a farm in Romsey,

392
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,559
um,

393
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,360
and,

394
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,559
you know,

395
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,460
really,

396
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,860
um,

397
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,960
like we've seen it in,

398
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,460
in working together,

399
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:28,559
you know,

400
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,460
a couple of years ago,

401
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,759
I really made the decision to pull back on a lot of the media that I do.

402
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,659
Um,

403
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:35,960
you know,

404
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,259
in the,

405
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:36,960
in the newspapers,

406
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,360
I take the holidays,

407
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,759
school holidays off.

408
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,159
Um,

409
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,759
and,

410
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,059
you know,

411
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,059
for me,

412
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,659
the kids growing up on a big farm,

413
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,259
there's always something to do.

414
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:47,360
There's always,

415
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,059
it's cheap that,

416
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,460
um,

417
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,559
that need to be looked after.

418
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:49,960
There's like,

419
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,360
just like a million jobs.

420
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
So for them,

421
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,559
you know,

422
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,360
they understand what I do,

423
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,659
but,

424
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:55,960
you know,

425
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,860
even,

426
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,759
um,

427
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,059
before Christmas,

428
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:04,059
they were at the agency that I work at and they were packing up food hampers for people,

429
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,059
for families that,

430
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,059
that didn't have enough food for Christmas.

431
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,659
So for me,

432
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,860
it's really important that they understand that,

433
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,159
you know,

434
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,960
too much is given,

435
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,460
much is expected.

436
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,759
And so,

437
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,059
yeah,

438
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:13,460
they're,

439
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,860
you know,

440
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
they're,

441
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,159
uh,

442
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,460
having to do,

443
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:16,759
you know,

444
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,259
a lot of the,

445
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,960
the jobs and things because they got the barefoot investor for a dad.

446
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,659
I gotta ask you a question.

447
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,259
You might find this hard to answer.

448
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:23,659
There's so many.

449
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:23,860
I want,

450
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,460
I want to go back to the trip around Australia and your timing in lockdown in Melbourne to get away with the family.

451
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,759
It was a,

452
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,659
it was a great story.

453
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:34,860
But is there a net worth amount that equals happiness for a family?

454
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,059
Can you actually give a number on that,

455
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:37,460
that you went,

456
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,759
if you,

457
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,659
if you've got beyond $3 million or $10 million or 15 million,

458
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,059
can you,

459
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,460
can you have a guess at that?

460
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,659
Well,

461
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,059
there was a,

462
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,460
there was a news.com,

463
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,759
um,

464
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,460
article,

465
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,960
um,

466
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,259
that,

467
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:49,559
that looked at a survey and it said,

468
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,259
how much do you need to be financially well off?

469
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,960
And I think the figure was about 360 grand a year.

470
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,559
That's five times the average income of,

471
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,460
and so,

472
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,759
you know,

473
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,559
what I would say to that is we are completely and utterly out of whack.

474
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:07,759
You know,

475
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,460
we are judging our values.

476
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,759
When I grew up,

477
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,659
I was judging my values of people who lived in Oyen in the country.

478
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,259
Now,

479
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,659
our kids judge their values.

480
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,360
Uh,

481
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,960
and,

482
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,759
and there's a lot in life by what they see online.

483
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,059
Yeah.

484
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,360
So it's completely warped.

485
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,659
Yeah.

486
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,860
So for me again,

487
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,059
and just to tie into,

488
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,960
to going around Australia,

489
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,259
you know,

490
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,059
we were living basically,

491
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,860
we were free camping a lot of the time,

492
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,159
you know,

493
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,559
we were,

494
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:31,860
you know,

495
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,659
just eating,

496
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,259
um,

497
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:33,659
you know,

498
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:33,960
on,

499
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,360
on the,

500
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,559
on the Barbie,

501
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:35,960
um,

502
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,460
spending very little money.

503
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,960
And that was the most,

504
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,759
that was the best trip of our lives.

505
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,259
How much that's cost?

506
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:42,860
Not that much.

507
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,059
I mean,

508
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:43,460
I didn't have,

509
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:43,759
I,

510
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,059
I didn't work for four and a half months.

511
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,860
So there's a,

512
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,360
there's a,

513
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,659
um,

514
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,360
there's a cost there,

515
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,159
but just that idea that I don't know if I could give you a figure,

516
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,659
because I think it's different for a lot of people,

517
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:59,460
but I think there are a lot of people that I meet that think they need to earn more.

518
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,759
Yeah.

519
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,159
And the definition of wealth is someone who's wealthier than you.

520
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,559
And that can be a real trap because what really matters,

521
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,159
I think is the time that you spend with your family ultimately.

522
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:10,460
I mean,

523
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,159
you can do a lot of things in your life and make a lot of money,

524
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,259
but I met a lot of very wealthy people whose kids don't really,

525
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,259
really like them.

526
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:17,659
Yeah.

527
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:17,960
You know,

528
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,259
so for me,

529
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,159
once you have a roof over your head and you know,

530
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,259
you pretty much paid it off,

531
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,059
um,

532
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,059
you got a decent car,

533
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,460
um,

534
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,159
you know,

535
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,259
everything else is gravy,

536
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:31,960
you know,

537
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
money's not going to make you any happier.

538
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,559
It's a great line,

539
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:34,759
isn't it?

540
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,259
From someone who spent their life in that space and you've lived it because the opportunity for you,

541
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:39,559
you know,

542
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:39,860
to,

543
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,460
to make,

544
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,860
uh,

545
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,360
extraordinary amounts of money have been open and,

546
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,759
uh,

547
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,960
you've made decisions along the way,

548
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,159
which I really admire.

549
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,960
Around family and around your values and about around where you live.

550
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,460
Um,

551
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,159
Steve Biddulph,

552
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,759
who's the legendary author of kids books.

553
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,059
Yeah.

554
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,159
And he talked about,

555
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:55,860
interestingly,

556
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,659
so one thing you should try and do with your family is go and take off and,

557
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,759
and spend some time and,

558
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,960
and do what you did.

559
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,559
Uh,

560
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,860
one of my great mates,

561
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
uh,

562
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,360
for 30 years has talked about his family trip around Australia.

563
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,559
Was it,

564
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,559
was it as good as it,

565
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,159
as it sounded?

566
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,360
It was challenging.

567
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,960
I'll be honest.

568
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,759
It was really challenging.

569
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,860
We got four kids,

570
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,259
um,

571
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,659
in an RV.

572
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,159
Um,

573
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,960
it was challenging,

574
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,360
but,

575
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,059
um,

576
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,860
it was the,

577
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,059
yeah,

578
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,559
it was the best trip I've ever had because number one,

579
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,360
it was COVID.

580
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,159
So Melbourne was basically in lockdown.

581
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:31,360
New South Wales was in lockdown and there was a lot of fear and a lot of stress.

582
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
And to be on the open road with the kids,

583
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,759
um,

584
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,159
you know,

585
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,759
pulling off to the side of the road,

586
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,460
having a little campfire,

587
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,659
just drinking in the amount of time that I got to spend with them.

588
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,360
Like literally I would have with my daughter,

589
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,860
who's three,

590
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,759
we'd have a,

591
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,759
a daddy daughter date,

592
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,259
a three day every day.

593
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,159
And we go for walks and I would just get on her level.

594
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,159
And I think there's something about getting out of your routine and actually just,

595
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,159
I see it as an investment,

596
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,159
really investing your time there.

597
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,159
I've never been closer to my kids.

598
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,559
And what was hard was we got home and we got this big house,

599
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:04,860
right?

600
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,159
So one went one way,

601
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,559
one went the other way and it's like,

602
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:07,659
oh,

603
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:08,860
we're back to normal.

604
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,259
But prior to that,

605
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:10,759
you know,

606
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,159
we're all in this little,

607
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,360
you know,

608
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,659
this little RV and we just lived with each other and it was fine.

609
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,860
So yeah,

610
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,460
it was great.

611
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,759
You got to share a story.

612
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,559
It's been a crazy time around the world,

613
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,159
but Australia particularly,

614
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,960
and you were trying to win your RV cross from Northern Territory into Western Australia.

615
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Explain what happened to you if you,

616
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,659
if you don't mind.

617
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah.

618
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,159
So,

619
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
I mean,

620
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,259
we'd heard as we were driving,

621
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,960
so we went up from Victoria up to,

622
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,259
skipped over New South Wales because they were going through their really bad lockdown.

623
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,559
Queensland to the Northern Territory.

624
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:50,360
And the Northern Territory WA border is in the Kimberley's and it's at the middle of nowhere,

625
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,159
like literally out the middle of nowhere.

626
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,159
And we'd,

627
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,460
we'd heard that they were really tough in WA.

628
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,059
So my wife had done all the right things.

629
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,860
She'd got this G2G app,

630
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,960
which basically asked you for all your information.

631
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,059
We got approved.

632
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:05,960
Everything was fine.

633
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,359
Rolled up to the,

634
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,259
to the border and we were met by a Western Australian police officer and I went down the window.

635
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,460
It was so hot.

636
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,059
It was like 40 degrees.

637
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,759
Kids are narky.

638
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,160
You know,

639
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,460
I'm just hot.

640
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,059
Gave her the app and she said,

641
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:22,460
I don't,

642
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,859
we don't,

643
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,859
we don't want that.

644
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,259
And I said,

645
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,059
well,

646
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,559
but that's what we have to do.

647
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,059
And she's like,

648
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:27,259
no,

649
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,960
that could be,

650
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,359
that could be faked.

651
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:30,859
And I'm like,

652
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:34,660
but it's your app and you scan it and it goes to your computer.

653
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,359
And she said,

654
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:35,759
basically,

655
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,259
don't be smart.

656
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,759
Hand me your phone,

657
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,460
open up your,

658
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,660
your private bank,

659
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:40,960
your,

660
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,359
your bank accounts,

661
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,460
open up your personal photos and hand me your phone.

662
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,160
And I looked at Liz and my wife and went,

663
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,660
and she's like,

664
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
just do it.

665
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,759
And so she took the phone and she walked away.

666
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,059
And your bank accounts open,

667
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,059
your personal photos open.

668
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:55,859
Looking through my bank accounts,

669
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,759
looking through my photos.

670
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,559
And it was really invasive.

671
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,059
And what they were doing was you had to be at that time,

672
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:11,160
you had to be in Northern Territory for 14 days before you could move over to WA.

673
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
And so what they were doing was trying to look at where we'd spent our money to try and,

674
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,359
basically say no.

675
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:17,660
Anyway,

676
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,059
she came back to me with this kind of twinkle in her eye cause she had the mask on and stuff.

677
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,559
And she's like,

678
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,059
what's this photo?

679
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:24,960
And Google had,

680
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:33,059
she'd be looking at the metadata on my photos and Google had incorrectly stated that I was in WA when it was really Northern Territory.

681
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,059
I explained it to her and she seemed genuinely annoyed that she had to pass us through.

682
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,660
The other interesting thing was they,

683
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,759
you had to be 14 days,

684
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,359
right?

685
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,660
So there were people who said,

686
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,859
well,

687
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,259
I got to the NT on day one and they went,

688
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,059
ah,

689
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,259
that's day zero.

690
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,259
You have another 24 hours.

691
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,059
So they're sitting up,

692
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,660
these poor bastards are sitting on the side of the road for 24 hours.

693
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,259
So then that I could get through.

694
00:18:58,259 --> 00:18:59,359
So it was,

695
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,259
it was kind of surreal,

696
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,759
a surreal time.

697
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,960
But again,

698
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,859
I was really,

699
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,660
when you got to WA,

700
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,359
it was like,

701
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:09,960
wow,

702
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,460
COVID doesn't even really exist.

703
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,359
Like don't worry about masks.

704
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,460
Everything's fine.

705
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,960
My friends overseas bring me in and they say,

706
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,259
what is going on?

707
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,259
And that is a crazy country that has unfolded in the last two years.

708
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,460
You live on this little island down there.

709
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,960
It was actually quite a big island.

710
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,460
And there's an imaginary border that you can't cross and you might have loved ones.

711
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,960
Or you try to tell my friends in America,

712
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,160
you know,

713
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,059
the 52,

714
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:37,160
you just can't believe that that has happened.

715
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,559
And people argue and say it was justified.

716
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,559
Probably don't want to get into that debate because it's not really what we're on about.

717
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,359
But you know,

718
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,259
there's a lot of,

719
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:48,660
of things we accepted and gave up that I was puzzled by really in the last two years.

720
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
Even the city we live in,

721
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,359
9pm curfews,

722
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,359
5k radius,

723
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,559
you couldn't move out from.

724
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,660
It was an extraordinary time.

725
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,259
It was.

726
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:55,660
And it was,

727
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,160
and you know,

728
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
again,

729
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
to be,

730
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,559
you know,

731
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,359
I felt,

732
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,059
never felt more wealthy because I was able to take those four and a half months off with the kids,

733
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:10,160
knowing that there's a lot of angst and stress and stuff all around us.

734
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,859
But to be,

735
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,160
to be on the open road,

736
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
and be able to spend time with,

737
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,759
with the kids and,

738
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,160
and take what is,

739
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,059
what was a very stressful time for a lot of people to,

740
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,960
to invest that in the kids was great.

741
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,859
But we're living in a time as well of 0% interest rates.

742
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,160
And there are people saying,

743
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,460
this is utopia opportunity to make money.

744
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,059
Like you've never made money before.

745
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,160
You think this is a disaster.

746
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,460
No,

747
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,059
I would agree.

748
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:41,259
I think it is a time to make a lot of money because what happens when you keep interest rates low,

749
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,660
is people like you and me,

750
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,559
who have assets,

751
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,859
who have shares get rich and those people that don't have assets get left behind.

752
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:51,660
And,

753
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,859
you know,

754
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:59,160
I've been really strong on this for a long time that I think we will look back on this and say,

755
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,559
what did we let these central banks do this for?

756
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,359
Like what,

757
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:08,660
whose idea was this that you could have the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years,

758
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,059
you know,

759
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,460
and be pumping money in as a consequence of COVID.

760
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,259
Now,

761
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:14,559
you know,

762
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,059
JobKeeper,

763
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:15,559
there was a,

764
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,859
there's a fair bit of spillage there,

765
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,759
but I understand that because I'm a financial counselor.

766
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,460
I help people who are in financial struggles.

767
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,559
I think that helped out a lot of people.

768
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:23,759
But,

769
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,059
you know,

770
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,160
as we sit here,

771
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,460
you know,

772
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:34,960
now in 2022 that they're still pumping a lot of money into the economy and interest rates are still basically zero.

773
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,660
I think we will look back on this in a generation and say,

774
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,359
why did,

775
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:38,660
you know,

776
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,460
we really income inequality in this country,

777
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,559
I think is one of the biggest issues.

778
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,859
That we're going to face.

779
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:49,559
If you have a young nurse and a police officer,

780
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,059
they can't afford to live in their community.

781
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,059
Or if they do,

782
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,059
they get saddled with debt.

783
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:01,460
That is just so high that changes things for them and puts them under financial stress.

784
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,359
I just think that I don't think anything good comes from it.

785
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,660
And I say that as a guy who's been cheering on the share market,

786
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,160
who thinks,

787
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,559
you know,

788
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,359
I've been loving the returns,

789
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,059
but you know,

790
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,660
at what cost?

791
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,059
And so,

792
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:13,259
yeah,

793
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:13,759
I just,

794
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,259
I just,

795
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:19,759
I look at it and think the other thing is that interest rates are starting to go up.

796
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,859
We have been through the average 40 year old has never seen a recession in their adult life.

797
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,259
And I just think that interest rates are going to start to go up.

798
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,059
And we,

799
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,960
as my hero,

800
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,759
Warren Buffett says,

801
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,460
we get to find out who's naked when the tide happens.

802
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,559
So the social divide,

803
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
I have to get back to you on Warren Buffett is,

804
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,359
as you said,

805
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,759
we'll talk about mentors in a moment.

806
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,660
I'm sure he's going to come up as people who've inspired you,

807
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,559
but this just creates greater divide in wealth.

808
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:48,759
And,

809
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:58,160
and we might touch on this because I know most of you get thousands and thousands of people write to you and seek financial counseling and want advice from you,

810
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,559
which you,

811
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,859
which you freely offer incredibly.

812
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:01,660
Um,

813
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,259
but there's a crypto comes up a lot in your world.

814
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,059
It comes up a lot,

815
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:05,660
Darcy.

816
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,160
Were you saying that you had a bit of a tickle?

817
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,759
You had a bit of a,

818
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,259
bit of a,

819
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:08,660
yeah,

820
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:08,859
look,

821
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:09,259
I am.

822
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:09,359
I,

823
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:09,859
I'm,

824
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:10,359
uh,

825
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:10,859
I'm a,

826
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:11,059
uh,

827
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:11,759
how have you gone?

828
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,559
Well,

829
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:12,759
you know,

830
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,259
probably been early enough to be okay.

831
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:14,460
Pay.

832
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,059
Really?

833
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:15,759
And what have you,

834
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,460
what have you invested in?

835
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:16,759
Well,

836
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,859
started with a bit of a Bitcoin.

837
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,460
I like in the Doge coin,

838
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,559
not in the Doge coin.

839
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:21,859
Okay.

840
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,559
Um,

841
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:22,859
and I,

842
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,359
and I get your world and I understand where you're going to go with this,

843
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:25,759
but,

844
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,759
but I also think,

845
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,359
you know,

846
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:34,359
part of the story for me was the US government printed a third of us dollars last year,

847
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,259
equivalent to all of the money that had been produced in history.

848
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,259
And so the idea that there is digital currency coming,

849
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:40,359
I,

850
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,059
someone like you will say,

851
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,059
which horse do you back?

852
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:42,559
And Bitcoin,

853
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,359
it could be back to zero at some point in time,

854
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,059
or Ripple who are solving the blockchain technology to,

855
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:48,359
uh,

856
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,859
to actually solve eventually the financial institutions are going to come on board with that technology.

857
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:53,359
So you're right.

858
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,059
It's,

859
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,559
but it's same as picking a stock,

860
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:55,859
isn't it?

861
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:56,960
And saying a stock and you say,

862
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,359
no,

863
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:57,960
am I,

864
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,259
no,

865
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,559
it's not because they don't make money.

866
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,359
And then when you're picking a stock,

867
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:01,759
you're buying,

868
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,859
you're becoming a part owner in a business.

869
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,460
And if you're a part owner in a business and that business generates stable profits,

870
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,960
you get any,

871
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,059
have you ever invested in gold before or silver?

872
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:10,759
You wouldn't do that.

873
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,460
Wouldn't touch it.

874
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,759
No,

875
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,059
I mean,

876
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:12,259
I,

877
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:12,559
I mean,

878
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,359
the only thing that,

879
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:13,660
you know,

880
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,160
for me,

881
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,460
it's,

882
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,859
it's a very simple,

883
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,460
um,

884
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,660
idea is that I only invest in things to make money.

885
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:19,960
Um,

886
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,859
so gold looks pretty,

887
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:22,259
um,

888
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:22,759
but it,

889
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,059
there,

890
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,059
there is no income.

891
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:24,259
Yeah.

892
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,460
And so therefore you can't really value that.

893
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,859
But again,

894
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:27,759
I agree with you.

895
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,460
Um,

896
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,759
I do think that it's a fascinating thing.

897
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,759
I just wouldn't be investing.

898
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:31,859
Oh,

899
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:32,359
well,

900
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,059
and tread your own path is your line.

901
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:34,759
I'm going to use it.

902
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,160
I think,

903
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,559
uh,

904
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,359
you do that well.

905
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:36,759
And I think,

906
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,059
you know,

907
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:37,460
others,

908
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,059
uh,

909
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,559
I mean,

910
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm not going to debate crypto with you.

911
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,359
Cause I don't think it's one that I'm going to end well for,

912
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:42,859
for me,

913
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:43,359
you know,

914
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,660
and I'm certainly not an ambassador for it,

915
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,359
but it,

916
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,259
there's a percentage of you.

917
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:48,960
Do you ever bet?

918
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,460
Do you ever,

919
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm not a punter.

920
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,660
I'm not a gamble.

921
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,359
You never have never had anything not for fun.

922
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:52,660
Oh,

923
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:52,859
I mean,

924
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,759
I haven't,

925
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,059
yeah,

926
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:54,559
I have in the,

927
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,059
in the past,

928
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:55,259
but,

929
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,059
but now I,

930
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:56,859
I don't.

931
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:57,759
And I just think,

932
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,559
um,

933
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:58,759
yeah,

934
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,259
for me,

935
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:00,359
it's that people say,

936
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:00,660
you know,

937
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
put 1% in,

938
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:01,859
uh,

939
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,559
in Bitcoin just as a hedge.

940
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:03,759
I'm like,

941
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:03,960
well,

942
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,759
it's just like saying,

943
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,960
put 1% in the pokies just in case you're in the jackpot.

944
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,859
Like,

945
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:08,359
but you know,

946
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,660
I do,

947
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I do understand where it,

948
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:09,859
where,

949
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:10,660
where it's coming from.

950
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,359
I just,

951
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,460
and I don't really mind what people do.

952
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,660
I,

953
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,259
I don't,

954
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,960
I find it all really interesting.

955
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,859
So I want to come back to leadership because,

956
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:18,559
uh,

957
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,559
that was where we started.

958
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,259
That's what the essence of what we're talking about.

959
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,259
You're a humble country boy,

960
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:22,660
as you said,

961
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:22,960
from,

962
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,660
from onion,

963
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:23,960
but,

964
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,160
and,

965
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,960
and humble enough to not see yourself in a little bit,

966
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,660
but you also intelligent enough to understand that you are in a serious

967
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,759
leadership position because so many people look to you,

968
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,660
and the words that you say resonate,

969
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:35,960
they,

970
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,059
they move the needle in finance in a way that hasn't happened in this country

971
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:39,460
before.

972
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,259
So have you thought more about that now,

973
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:42,859
uh,

974
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,059
as,

975
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:43,859
as a leader,

976
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:44,359
you know,

977
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,759
and the way that you deal with that?

978
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:45,960
Yeah.

979
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,259
I mean,

980
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:46,559
I mean,

981
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,559
I think one of the things,

982
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,759
so I went and did financial counseling because I really,

983
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,359
it was maybe the old man saying,

984
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,460
look after the battlers.

985
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,359
And I really wanted to see,

986
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,359
you know,

987
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:56,859
um,

988
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,359
to try and help people that,

989
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,759
you know,

990
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,460
single parents and,

991
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,559
and people that have,

992
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:02,960
um,

993
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,660
the cards of,

994
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,259
uh,

995
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,559
have been dealt wrong to them.

996
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,559
But one of the things that,

997
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,160
um,

998
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,259
that I came back from after doing that was,

999
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:11,759
um,

1000
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,460
I would help the parents,

1001
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:13,859
right.

1002
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:14,759
I would help them,

1003
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,259
you know,

1004
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,759
try and get their debts waived or,

1005
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,059
you know,

1006
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,160
try and get them back on,

1007
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:18,859
on track.

1008
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,960
But there would be a kid while I was meeting with parents that was sitting

1009
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,660
there and I'm like,

1010
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,759
I want to help that kid.

1011
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,160
I want to make sure that that kid doesn't,

1012
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:27,859
um,

1013
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,859
fall into the same trap that the parents did.

1014
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,960
And so for me it was like,

1015
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:33,559
um,

1016
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,759
what I really want to do and what I'm really passionate about is helping the

1017
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,759
next generation.

1018
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:39,960
And so for me,

1019
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:40,660
you know,

1020
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,259
we've had conversations about this forever,

1021
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:42,660
but you know,

1022
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,960
the idea that really you can go through 18 years of school or,

1023
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,259
you know,

1024
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:47,759
um,

1025
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:54,859
12 years of school and not really learn anything about financial education.

1026
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:55,160
And,

1027
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,460
and,

1028
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:56,059
and,

1029
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:56,259
and,

1030
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:56,359
you know,

1031
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,660
it's the one test that every kid's going to be.

1032
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,559
It's the one exam.

1033
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,460
Every kid's going to be tested on it every day of their lives.

1034
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,460
And yet we don't really teach it that well.

1035
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,359
It's kind of something that some schools do and others don't.

1036
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,460
And that to me in this day and age,

1037
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,059
when we're talking about Bitcoin and,

1038
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,359
and all sorts of things that are happening,

1039
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,160
the fact that we don't do that really upset me.

1040
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,259
And so for me,

1041
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:21,559
I'm like,

1042
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,059
if there's one thing that I can do,

1043
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:23,859
given that I bought,

1044
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,759
I've got this platform,

1045
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,259
it's to try and make change there.

1046
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,559
And it's an amazing story.

1047
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,759
Your Foxtel show,

1048
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,059
you know,

1049
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:30,859
was great.

1050
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,460
It got up and running just at the start of COVID.

1051
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
And I'm sure,

1052
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,359
there's more to come on that front.

1053
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,359
And I love the courage.

1054
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,059
You've really,

1055
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:37,559
you know,

1056
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,460
pushed back at the big banks who had themselves entrenched in schools,

1057
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,059
the Commonwealth Bank Dolomites account.

1058
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,160
My friends in advertising will say that was the greatest advertising.

1059
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,759
Some might say the most evil.

1060
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:50,259
Most lucrative.

1061
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:50,559
I mean,

1062
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,559
it's made them billions because they signed up kids straight out of school,

1063
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,660
who then graduated to credit cards and,

1064
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,259
you know,

1065
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,660
but they're now gone.

1066
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,359
And collected their data along the way and had enormous information on kids,

1067
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,160
under the guise of here's your,

1068
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,960
your Dolomite account.

1069
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,559
So many,

1070
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:06,960
you know,

1071
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
customers would be sitting here listening to this and saying,

1072
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,759
that was me as a kid.

1073
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,160
We all remember it,

1074
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
but you've pushed really hard.

1075
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,759
And so we need to get the vested interest out of schools and we need to get the education back.

1076
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,859
Can you sum it up?

1077
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:20,259
What are the things that kids need to know?

1078
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:23,259
What are the basics they need to know coming in and out of school?

1079
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,059
Well,

1080
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:24,259
I mean,

1081
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:28,460
I think in a primary school level,

1082
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,559
my view is that you need to understand,

1083
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,859
it sounds really basic,

1084
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:33,660
but I,

1085
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,460
you need to understand it's fun to work.

1086
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,359
It's good to work.

1087
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,160
Um,

1088
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:37,759
um,

1089
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,059
it's good to spend money.

1090
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,460
No one wants a tight ass,

1091
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,759
you know,

1092
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,559
it's good to spend money,

1093
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:41,960
but I'm,

1094
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,359
I'm careful about the money that I spend.

1095
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:43,859
And I'm,

1096
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,559
I'm kind of,

1097
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,359
I understand that I'm going to be manipulated by marketers to,

1098
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:47,559
to,

1099
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,859
to want certain things,

1100
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,559
especially on social media and influences and stuff.

1101
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:52,259
Um,

1102
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:52,660
uh,

1103
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
it's good to invest.

1104
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:54,859
That's how you get rich,

1105
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:55,359
right?

1106
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,359
So your money grows while you don't have to work.

1107
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:57,859
Uh,

1108
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,759
and it's good to give,

1109
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,359
you know,

1110
00:28:59,359 --> 00:28:59,660
it's,

1111
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,559
it's the givers in this world are the people that are the,

1112
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,460
are the happiest.

1113
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,359
So they are re they're,

1114
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,259
they're behaviors,

1115
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:06,660
right?

1116
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,660
That's not tech.

1117
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,460
That's not getting too technical,

1118
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,259
but if you can teach a kid that it's good to get up and work,

1119
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,660
I know 35 year olds that haven't got that lesson,

1120
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,359
you know,

1121
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:16,859
that they had,

1122
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,259
that just hasn't computed for them.

1123
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,559
So they're those basic lessons that you can,

1124
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,859
if you can instill them in your kids,

1125
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:23,359
right?

1126
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,359
The thing I say is that with no one wants to raise a spoiled brat,

1127
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,259
it just happens,

1128
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:27,559
right?

1129
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,160
And the way it happens is you give kids money for doing nothing,

1130
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,660
right?

1131
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,460
And you don't have,

1132
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
a focus on giving.

1133
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:33,960
Yeah.

1134
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:34,559
So if you,

1135
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,859
if you get kids to,

1136
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,059
to do some sort of giving within their community or they,

1137
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,960
some of their money has to go to giving someone other than them and working

1138
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,160
hard,

1139
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
I think that's important.

1140
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:44,960
Um,

1141
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,359
for the high school kids,

1142
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:46,859
um,

1143
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:48,259
I created a program,

1144
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,160
uh,

1145
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,559
and,

1146
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:49,960
and the,

1147
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,460
the book barefoot families,

1148
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,259
um,

1149
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,660
as around this idea of the barefoot 10,

1150
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,559
these 10 things that you can get your kids to do,

1151
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,160
you know,

1152
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,359
having your kids,

1153
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,759
um,

1154
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:01,059
be able to cook a delicious,

1155
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,059
nutritious meal,

1156
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:02,559
right?

1157
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,059
Rather than getting Uber eats,

1158
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:04,660
um,

1159
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:07,160
having them apply for a job.

1160
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,859
So they actually have to go and sell themselves when they're teenagers and they,

1161
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:11,160
you know,

1162
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,259
grumbly and stuff.

1163
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:12,960
Um,

1164
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,259
you know,

1165
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,960
having them hopefully getting a bad boss that,

1166
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,559
you know,

1167
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,559
rides them a bit,

1168
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,059
you know,

1169
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,759
so that they actually have to work out,

1170
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,259
you know,

1171
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,059
that whole power dynamic and relationship,

1172
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:23,759
um,

1173
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,059
learning to invest,

1174
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:25,259
you know,

1175
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,259
or just these little learning lessons that you can do with your kids that while they're still under your roof,

1176
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:30,660
they can,

1177
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,859
they can make those mistakes.

1178
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:38,359
But they just have that ability because what I find is I will meet 23,

1179
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,859
24 year olds who say when they 16,

1180
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,559
I'm not really good with maths.

1181
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,859
I'm not a really not a good numbers person.

1182
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,759
And so what happens is they turn 18,

1183
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,460
they get a credit card,

1184
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,859
they get after pay debt,

1185
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,259
and then they wind up in my office saying,

1186
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:54,859
see,

1187
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm,

1188
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,460
I told you I was no good with money and I've got the credit card balance to prove it.

1189
00:30:58,759 --> 00:30:59,960
And so for me,

1190
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,759
what's important is trying to get kids,

1191
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,259
to learn that life skills before they graduate,

1192
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:07,660
because as soon as they do,

1193
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:11,859
they are the most heavily marketed to generation in history.

1194
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:12,759
And all,

1195
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,460
as you said,

1196
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,259
all the financial institutions have been doing AB split tests.

1197
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,960
They know exactly how to get you to spend their money.

1198
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:21,960
Um,

1199
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,160
and so I just think that the banks have become very good at selling money.

1200
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,960
We need to get better at helping our kids,

1201
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,259
um,

1202
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:28,960
resist that.

1203
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,289
I want to go back to something.

1204
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:37,589
It's,

1205
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:41,089
and I love your language because it makes sense and it's always clear.

1206
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,089
And it's something that has,

1207
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:43,490
uh,

1208
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,089
resulted in so many people hanging off every word you say in this space,

1209
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,490
because it does make sense.

1210
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,089
But you said something earlier saying some of the rich people,

1211
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:51,390
you know,

1212
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,589
some of the unhappiest people,

1213
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:55,990
and we understand financial hardship is terrible as well.

1214
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:56,390
It is.

1215
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,089
But I think very few people understand,

1216
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:02,789
and you and I would have been exposed to people who inherited a lot of money from really wealthy families.

1217
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:07,089
Some of the saddest people you ever meet because exactly what you said,

1218
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:11,089
they've never really had to think about work and never had a meaningful job.

1219
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,490
It's all been there for them.

1220
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,089
And you can't have too much money,

1221
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:14,390
can't you?

1222
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,490
It's the paradox of choice.

1223
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,089
Like I've,

1224
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:16,990
I've worked with,

1225
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,289
um,

1226
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:18,490
very wealthy,

1227
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,190
uh,

1228
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:19,890
uh,

1229
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,690
families,

1230
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:20,890
um,

1231
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,589
that have family offices and things.

1232
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:23,089
And,

1233
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:23,490
and,

1234
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:23,890
uh,

1235
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,789
that is something that I would never want for my children.

1236
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,390
Um,

1237
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,390
the idea,

1238
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:28,589
you know,

1239
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:29,289
it's that again,

1240
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,789
the Warren Buffett thing of give your kids enough that they can do anything,

1241
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:33,390
but not enough.

1242
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,190
They can do nothing.

1243
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,990
And that idea of actually saying,

1244
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:36,890
you've got all the money,

1245
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,390
you don't have to work.

1246
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,890
It blunts your ambition.

1247
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,789
Um,

1248
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,289
and it's just something that I,

1249
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:44,289
I wouldn't do that idea of the work ethic,

1250
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:45,089
whether that is,

1251
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,089
um,

1252
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:46,690
you know,

1253
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,990
building a business or doing something that you're passionate about to help people.

1254
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,890
I think that's the,

1255
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,089
that's really the essence of it.

1256
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,390
One of the great Warren Buffett lines,

1257
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:53,789
isn't it?

1258
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,990
Who's worth over a hundred billion dollars.

1259
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,289
Yes.

1260
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,490
Father of three.

1261
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,690
I think he might've paid their college fees,

1262
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,190
maybe,

1263
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,789
or maybe not.

1264
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:01,089
Actually,

1265
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:01,289
you know,

1266
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:02,990
I met his son,

1267
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,589
Peter.

1268
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:04,089
Really?

1269
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:04,789
And what was,

1270
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,589
what was interesting,

1271
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:06,789
I spent some time with him.

1272
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,490
And he told me that in his thirties,

1273
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,690
there were times where he was struggling to pay his mortgage.

1274
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,190
But just to pause for a sec,

1275
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,190
for those that aren't,

1276
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,490
you know,

1277
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,190
Warren Buffett,

1278
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,690
the greatest investor of all time,

1279
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,190
you know,

1280
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,990
has been the richest or in the top five with net worth of over a hundred billion dollars.

1281
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,589
You met one of the three sons.

1282
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:27,089
He would be the richest person on earth,

1283
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,390
but he's given away most of his money and he's still one of the,

1284
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:30,589
you know,

1285
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:31,190
in the top three,

1286
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,690
top five.

1287
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,190
So his son inherited almost,

1288
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,789
and at times was struggling to pay his mortgage.

1289
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:37,490
Yeah,

1290
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:37,890
he was,

1291
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,289
um,

1292
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,390
I sat down and spent some time with him.

1293
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,789
He was a really quietly spoken,

1294
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:43,490
humble guy.

1295
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,289
He said that he didn't know that his father was,

1296
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,390
um,

1297
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:47,990
you know,

1298
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,490
one of the world's richest men while he was at school.

1299
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,289
Um,

1300
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,390
his father was just a finance nerd.

1301
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:55,789
They went to the local,

1302
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,490
um,

1303
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,390
the local Omaha schools.

1304
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,390
Um,

1305
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:02,589
and his dad still lives in that same house that he bought.

1306
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:02,990
Still,

1307
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,490
still lives there.

1308
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:03,890
Incredible.

1309
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,890
Um,

1310
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,990
and he said that,

1311
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,490
um,

1312
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:06,890
yeah,

1313
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,089
he,

1314
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,389
he remembers being in his,

1315
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,190
I think his twenties or thirties,

1316
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,190
he had a mortgage and he was struggling.

1317
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,289
Um,

1318
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,090
and,

1319
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,489
uh,

1320
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,389
but you know,

1321
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:15,690
he,

1322
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,389
he again learned from his father that,

1323
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:18,889
uh,

1324
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,690
he was passionate.

1325
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,389
His father was passionate about investing.

1326
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,889
He's passionate about music.

1327
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,489
He won an Emmy,

1328
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,190
I believe for a screenplay that he wrote with,

1329
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,289
uh,

1330
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:28,389
dances with wolves.

1331
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,590
So he's very passionate about what he's doing.

1332
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,989
So you meet this guy and go,

1333
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,690
yeah,

1334
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,989
you may not have got the money,

1335
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,489
but you've got something.

1336
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,789
Equally as important,

1337
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:39,489
which is a passion for what you do.

1338
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,289
And I've got this view.

1339
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,289
You can't manufacture passion in your kids.

1340
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,590
Well,

1341
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:42,789
yeah,

1342
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:42,889
no,

1343
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:42,989
no.

1344
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,190
Yeah.

1345
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,989
That was the thing that,

1346
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,190
you know,

1347
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,489
you,

1348
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,590
I meet you and I would meet a lot of,

1349
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:47,590
uh,

1350
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,590
wealthy people,

1351
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,489
a lot of successful people who talk a big game.

1352
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,190
And,

1353
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,989
and when you're really rich,

1354
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:57,090
you have the ability to market yourself,

1355
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:57,789
um,

1356
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:58,989
to create a facade.

1357
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,690
But my view was the one thing that you can't do.

1358
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,690
You can't fake is your kids.

1359
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,789
You can't fake them.

1360
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,989
And so when I met him,

1361
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:08,289
I'm like,

1362
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:12,389
you are just a cool dude and you've been raised the right way.

1363
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:12,889
So,

1364
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:13,389
and to me,

1365
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,090
that is like the ultimate success,

1366
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:15,590
you know,

1367
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,090
that's right.

1368
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,989
If your kids are happy and the ultimate regret,

1369
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:18,989
if they're not correct,

1370
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,090
you didn't invest the time.

1371
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,190
So I'll get to the questions I asked at the end,

1372
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,789
but one estate planning for Scotty Pope,

1373
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,789
then what do you leave your full kids?

1374
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:29,389
Well,

1375
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:29,590
I mean,

1376
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:29,989
I've been,

1377
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,190
I've always been very,

1378
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,989
um,

1379
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:32,489
uh,

1380
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:33,889
open with this.

1381
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:34,389
So,

1382
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:34,889
um,

1383
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:35,789
I,

1384
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:37,789
my kids aren't going to get anything.

1385
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:38,090
Um,

1386
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,389
I mean,

1387
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:39,289
they'll pay for,

1388
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:40,989
I'll pay for their education,

1389
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:43,989
which is like a huge thing and absolutely huge thing.

1390
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:44,789
Um,

1391
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,389
but I don't think you'll leave them nothing.

1392
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:47,289
No,

1393
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:47,590
I mean,

1394
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:47,889
I'll,

1395
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:48,289
I'll,

1396
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,090
so I'll leave them,

1397
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,889
um,

1398
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,389
the,

1399
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,090
the farm.

1400
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,789
They'll all have the farm that we currently live on.

1401
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:55,289
And I'm,

1402
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:55,590
you know,

1403
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:55,889
again,

1404
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:56,289
I'm a,

1405
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,289
I'm a longterm dude.

1406
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:02,889
So what you'll find me doing a lot is I'm planning a lot of chestnut trees and oak trees.

1407
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,989
These things.

1408
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:05,090
Don't really,

1409
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,789
they say you,

1410
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:05,989
you know,

1411
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,889
you plant a nut trees for your grandkids.

1412
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,690
So they're there.

1413
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,989
They will get this amazing farm that they'll all use,

1414
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,789
but they're not getting to farm chestnuts and to farm.

1415
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:18,989
No,

1416
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:19,190
no,

1417
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,489
just because they'll be beautiful in,

1418
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:21,690
in 50 years time.

1419
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,190
Yeah.

1420
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,389
Not,

1421
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,690
not as a commercial aspect of that.

1422
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,090
I mean,

1423
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,690
I mean,

1424
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,489
farmers markets and all that sort of stuff.

1425
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:27,989
But you know,

1426
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:29,489
the idea that my kids,

1427
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:30,190
um,

1428
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,789
will,

1429
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,090
um,

1430
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,590
always,

1431
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,989
they will grow up in that home or on that farm.

1432
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,289
Um,

1433
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:41,889
and it will always be theirs and it will be a place where hopefully as the kids get older and they have their own families that draws them back.

1434
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:42,190
Yeah.

1435
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,489
You know,

1436
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:43,090
we've got a big,

1437
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,489
you know,

1438
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:44,389
damn,

1439
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,190
um,

1440
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,489
we've,

1441
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:45,989
we've got,

1442
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:46,389
you know,

1443
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:46,590
it's,

1444
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:46,989
it's a,

1445
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:48,190
it's a kid's paradise,

1446
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,489
you know?

1447
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:49,389
So for the grandkids,

1448
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:51,590
hopefully it'll be a place where they all go back to.

1449
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:52,489
Um,

1450
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:59,489
but as far as leaving them a large amount of money to not do anything with or to bank on or to fight with,

1451
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:00,090
I mean,

1452
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,989
I have sat in rooms with.

1453
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:12,989
Household name families that have hundreds of millions of dollars and that has scared me when you look at the way that wealth has played out.

1454
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:13,389
Yeah.

1455
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:18,989
It's been really debilitating for most of those people that I've met and I would not want that for my kids.

1456
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:19,190
Yeah.

1457
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,590
It's a powerful thing to say.

1458
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:20,690
Yeah.

1459
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,389
Family breakdown that comes with often that amount of money is,

1460
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:24,690
uh,

1461
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,389
is extraordinary.

1462
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:25,690
So,

1463
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:25,989
um,

1464
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:26,190
yeah,

1465
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,590
I will just say that I'm going to,

1466
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,389
my wife and I are going to,

1467
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,989
we don't have huge amounts of money,

1468
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:31,489
but,

1469
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:32,190
um,

1470
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,489
you know,

1471
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:33,389
on a global scale,

1472
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,389
we are very wealthy as,

1473
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:34,989
as you are,

1474
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,989
as anyone listening to this is,

1475
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:37,289
but,

1476
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:37,590
you know,

1477
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,989
my thing is I've sort of turned,

1478
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:42,090
I'm very much into my not for profit stuff.

1479
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,289
So we'll create a foundation at some point and the kids will end up managing that.

1480
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,789
What a great story and a great story of leadership,

1481
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:49,989
Poby.

1482
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:50,489
I love it.

1483
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:50,989
And I think,

1484
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:51,489
um,

1485
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:51,889
you know,

1486
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:52,590
true to yourself,

1487
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,389
treading your own path,

1488
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,489
you couldn't leave your values any more than,

1489
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,789
than anyone I think I've ever met.

1490
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,889
So we ask these questions,

1491
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:58,289
Poby,

1492
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,789
because we're into leadership and I say,

1493
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:00,289
we,

1494
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:00,690
uh,

1495
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,389
passion we've got,

1496
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,289
and I've spoken to you about,

1497
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,190
what we're doing in education ourselves with the leader.

1498
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,190
And we're seeing these common traits of leaders as I see you and self leadership.

1499
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,489
What,

1500
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:09,690
what,

1501
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,590
what does that mean to you when I talk about self leadership?

1502
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:12,989
Well,

1503
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:13,590
I mean,

1504
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:13,789
yeah,

1505
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:14,090
again,

1506
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,090
I don't really see myself as a leader.

1507
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,389
Um,

1508
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:22,989
one of the things I've tried to do is every column for nearly 19 years,

1509
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:23,289
the,

1510
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,090
I don't know why I started doing this from the very first column.

1511
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,889
It was that my sign off is true drone path.

1512
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,889
And to me,

1513
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,190
that has been what I,

1514
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,190
I try and kind of my North star in that,

1515
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,690
um,

1516
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,690
I wrote a book,

1517
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,190
I did very well.

1518
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,489
Um,

1519
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:39,389
and then I looked at it and thought,

1520
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:40,489
what am I really interested in?

1521
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,590
I'm interested in people who've,

1522
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:42,989
who,

1523
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:43,889
who struggle,

1524
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:48,889
or I'm interested in making sure that their kids and all kids learn this stuff.

1525
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:52,289
And I'm interested in my kids and spending more time with them and less time,

1526
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:52,789
you know,

1527
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,090
running around promoting myself.

1528
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,289
So I guess for me,

1529
00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:01,889
it is the whole treasure and path ethos and not buying into more money.

1530
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,190
It is better because I've,

1531
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,389
I've learned enough through meeting other people who have become very,

1532
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:08,989
very wealthy,

1533
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:13,190
that you can't buy back the time that you can spend with your family and your

1534
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,590
kids.

1535
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,090
Yeah.

1536
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,789
Beautiful message,

1537
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:15,090
mate,

1538
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,690
that you've articulated so well,

1539
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,889
positively impacting others in your environment.

1540
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,190
I suppose a lot of your work has been a solo.

1541
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,690
You haven't,

1542
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,289
um,

1543
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:24,889
necessarily worked in big teams.

1544
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:25,989
Is that fair to say or not?

1545
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:26,289
Yeah,

1546
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:26,590
no,

1547
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,389
that is fair to say.

1548
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:27,590
I mean,

1549
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,789
one of the things that I've,

1550
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:29,389
um,

1551
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,789
that I've tried to do,

1552
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:32,690
is,

1553
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,190
um,

1554
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:35,489
with Barefoot Investor,

1555
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:38,789
it became a huge and is a huge community.

1556
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,590
Um,

1557
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,989
and so what I try and do each week in the newspaper and on my email,

1558
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:48,190
it goes to like half a million people is to,

1559
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,590
I try and tell people stories.

1560
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:50,989
Um,

1561
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:55,289
and there's a lot of family violence of people that have escaped in the middle

1562
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:59,090
of the night and who have been able to rebuild themselves or,

1563
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,389
um,

1564
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:01,690
about little kids that have started a lemonade stand,

1565
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,690
or stories of people that have been able to rise up,

1566
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:06,389
um,

1567
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:12,590
through either Barefoot Investor or just because of them drawing a line in the sand and saying,

1568
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,489
this is what I want to do.

1569
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,789
So for me,

1570
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:15,489
um,

1571
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,590
I sort of see the community that I've built,

1572
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,389
even though it's really big now,

1573
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,789
as highlighting those stories and,

1574
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,090
and,

1575
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,090
and celebrating them.

1576
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,690
Not sure you could positively impact people more than that.

1577
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,090
And if you,

1578
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,190
if you think Scotty Pope doesn't live his values,

1579
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,090
he had a subscription,

1580
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,090
uh,

1581
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,489
business,

1582
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:35,789
every business wants a subscription model and you shut it down and he said,

1583
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:36,690
I mean,

1584
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,889
it's extraordinary and I'm going to do this all for free.

1585
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,789
I'm going to get my newsletter out there and that's the way.

1586
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:43,190
So if you want to get weekly communication,

1587
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,190
how do we get that with Scotty Pope?

1588
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,690
Uh,

1589
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,190
well,

1590
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,590
uh,

1591
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,389
either in the,

1592
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:47,090
in the newspapers,

1593
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,989
the Herald Sun or,

1594
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:48,389
um,

1595
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,590
go to barefootinvestor.com and you'll get the,

1596
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,190
the email.

1597
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,090
We see leaders who are really clear on creating and sharing their vision and your

1598
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,889
vision now to improve the financial,

1599
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:57,489
uh,

1600
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,690
literacy and education of kids in schools and,

1601
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,889
and to help those that need it,

1602
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:03,190
the most is an extraordinary vision.

1603
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,190
Do you give a lot of thought to how you share that and create it?

1604
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:06,989
Yeah,

1605
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:07,289
it's,

1606
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:07,590
um,

1607
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,190
it has been dust.

1608
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,590
It's been really interesting because again,

1609
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:12,989
as you said,

1610
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:14,690
I haven't really had a big team around me.

1611
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,989
It's just sort of been me.

1612
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:16,789
Um,

1613
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,590
and I had this idea of the money movement where I was going to try and,

1614
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,289
um,

1615
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:23,489
get financial education in schools.

1616
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,889
It actually worked out to be really tough.

1617
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,389
Um,

1618
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:28,289
because I mean,

1619
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,789
I think one barrier is you've got to teach the teachers.

1620
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,090
Who maybe didn't learn about this in school and,

1621
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,389
and,

1622
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:36,690
and are already overrun and may have their own financial issues.

1623
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:37,590
Um,

1624
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:39,190
and it became,

1625
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,389
it is a really hard endeavor and I think where I'm at at the moment with it is

1626
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:48,889
that I'm writing another book as we speak sort of barefoot investor for kids

1627
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:50,489
where I'm talking directly to the kid.

1628
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:50,789
Yeah.

1629
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,590
Um,

1630
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:56,090
and sort of that's where I've really had the most success is in writing

1631
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,889
something super engaging.

1632
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:00,690
It's really challenging because I'm writing to kids.

1633
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,989
It's with very limited attention spans,

1634
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:03,789
but yeah,

1635
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:04,090
that's,

1636
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,789
that's sort of the next project is to try and write a book,

1637
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,590
um,

1638
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:07,989
that,

1639
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,090
that really hits sort of primary school kids,

1640
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:10,889
um,

1641
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:13,389
and that they get and that they learn from doing.

1642
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:14,690
So that's the next thing.

1643
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,590
And it's a fair point.

1644
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:15,989
You may have,

1645
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:18,590
we've found in the way that we've been doing teachers themselves are under

1646
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,489
enormous amount of stress more than I understood.

1647
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:25,289
And a lot of their work from what we're here is social work.

1648
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:30,590
They're getting kids to come to school that really trying to get them healthy enough to be able to participate.

1649
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,190
The start is a huge challenge.

1650
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:39,190
And then we're laying all these things on one of our passions is about teaching mindfulness and meditation to teachers.

1651
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,690
And we're,

1652
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,389
we're launching a social venture in that space,

1653
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:42,489
but we actually worked at,

1654
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:48,789
we really got to sort of look after teachers first and their wellbeing so they can pass that wellbeing onto the kids.

1655
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:49,389
And it's a,

1656
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:50,389
it is an issue in Australia.

1657
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:54,889
I feel like we value our teachers anywhere near pay them enough or,

1658
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:56,190
or revere them enough.

1659
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,090
Other parts of the world do it a lot better than we do.

1660
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,489
Yeah.

1661
00:42:58,489 --> 00:42:58,789
And,

1662
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,190
and that was one of the things that I,

1663
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,489
when I,

1664
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:01,389
when I first went in,

1665
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:02,289
it was like,

1666
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,590
we need to teach the teachers.

1667
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,789
Like if you are going in,

1668
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:06,889
maybe when we were younger,

1669
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,289
it was like,

1670
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:07,590
Oh,

1671
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:07,989
be the,

1672
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:08,690
be a teacher.

1673
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,789
You get all the holidays and all the rest of it.

1674
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,090
I would not,

1675
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,889
I couldn't hack being a teacher.

1676
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,690
Like it is really hard.

1677
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,889
They don't get paid enough.

1678
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:17,389
As you said,

1679
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,489
there's a lot of social work and stuff going on.

1680
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:22,090
There's a lot of regulatory stuff now.

1681
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:22,690
Um,

1682
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,190
and,

1683
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,489
uh,

1684
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:25,289
one of the things that I found was,

1685
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:25,489
um,

1686
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:28,190
if I could spend time with young teachers,

1687
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,090
just starting out a lot of them,

1688
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,690
their first four or five years,

1689
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,889
they're on contract.

1690
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:35,590
So they really don't have the job security.

1691
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,289
They don't get paid a lot of money.

1692
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:37,690
They're,

1693
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:37,889
you know,

1694
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:38,590
in the deep end,

1695
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,690
they're dealing with parents,

1696
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,889
they're dealing with all sorts of things.

1697
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:42,389
And,

1698
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:42,789
you know,

1699
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:43,989
in the current environment,

1700
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:47,389
if you are in Melbourne or any of the capital cities,

1701
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:52,590
the chances of you buying a home is next to nothing on that wage,

1702
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:52,889
you know?

1703
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:53,489
So it's,

1704
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,889
it's incredibly tough for them.

1705
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:55,889
So for me,

1706
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:56,389
again,

1707
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:57,489
part of the thing I learned was that,

1708
00:43:57,489 --> 00:43:57,690
yes,

1709
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:58,590
I want to get to the kids,

1710
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,989
but being able to talk to those teachers,

1711
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:01,489
and help them,

1712
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:03,190
because if they get excited about it,

1713
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,489
they are the advocates and the gatekeepers for the kids like that.

1714
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:06,690
You know,

1715
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,090
what I've found is the politicians,

1716
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,590
the education boards and stuff,

1717
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,289
I can say things,

1718
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:14,190
but if you get a teacher that cares about your kids or their kids,

1719
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,489
that's what you need.

1720
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:15,989
Well,

1721
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:19,590
thinking of a time I was away with my wife,

1722
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,889
we weren't married at this time,

1723
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:23,789
and her brother was living in Switzerland and he had a Swiss girlfriend,

1724
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,789
two highly intelligent people.

1725
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:26,789
She's one of the smartest people.

1726
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,489
And,

1727
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:27,789
uh,

1728
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:28,389
and my,

1729
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:28,489
uh,

1730
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,690
my brother-in-law is as well.

1731
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:29,789
And,

1732
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:31,590
and she just got news the day we landed there,

1733
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,989
I'd only just met her,

1734
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:34,989
and she could do anything she wanted at university.

1735
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:38,989
And the word came through that she was accepted to be a teacher and the family celebration.

1736
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:39,690
Wow.

1737
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,789
And the benefits and the,

1738
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,690
the kudos that was given that she was,

1739
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:44,989
uh,

1740
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:45,190
you know,

1741
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,090
respected enough to be accepted as a teacher.

1742
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:47,389
I thought,

1743
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:47,489
God,

1744
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:47,789
you,

1745
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:47,989
you,

1746
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,690
you put that overlay on Australia.

1747
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,190
We don't have anywhere near,

1748
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,389
probably the most important thing is who's in front of our kids.

1749
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:54,690
Pepe,

1750
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,590
we talk to leaders who really have curiosity as a common trait,

1751
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,489
and we see,

1752
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,789
they approach their learning and development through this sort of curious mindset.

1753
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,590
Does that resonate with you and your own development?

1754
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:05,789
Oh,

1755
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:06,289
absolutely.

1756
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:06,590
I mean,

1757
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,389
I think part of the reason,

1758
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:09,590
you know,

1759
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,289
I wrote the book and I've been doing barefoot,

1760
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:16,289
but one of the things that was sort of foreign to me a little bit was,

1761
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:16,590
you know,

1762
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:16,889
I,

1763
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:18,889
I have a very privileged upbringing.

1764
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:19,289
You know,

1765
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:19,889
I had,

1766
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,690
I had two parents that loved me.

1767
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,090
Um,

1768
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,889
I lived in a stable home in,

1769
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,190
in the country,

1770
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,289
and I had really no context of family,

1771
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:33,789
violence and mental health issues and all the things that,

1772
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:36,289
that affect a large,

1773
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:37,190
um,

1774
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,489
proportion of Australians.

1775
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:39,090
So for me,

1776
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:45,789
the idea of actually going back to TAFE and kind of learning to be a social worker and actually doing,

1777
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:45,989
I,

1778
00:45:45,989 --> 00:45:47,690
I've worked in prisons.

1779
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,190
Um,

1780
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,489
I,

1781
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:49,590
I've worked in juvenile,

1782
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,090
uh,

1783
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:50,889
juvenile,

1784
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:51,090
uh,

1785
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,590
detention centers,

1786
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,289
um,

1787
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:55,190
and just to learn,

1788
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,389
um,

1789
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,590
other people's,

1790
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,090
um,

1791
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,789
paths.

1792
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,090
And,

1793
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:05,190
and really how those choices have led them to where they are and to help them try and communicate,

1794
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,789
get them on a level that can help lift them out of that and their kids.

1795
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:10,989
That to me is what is really fascinating.

1796
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:12,090
That's what I find really,

1797
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,690
really interesting and being able to communicate in a way that actually meets them.

1798
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:23,289
Whereas a lot of the finance stuff is sort of aimed at people who are already wealthy or people who are already going to sit and,

1799
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:23,789
you know,

1800
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:25,889
input things into a spreadsheet.

1801
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:28,989
I want to try and get people that have never thought that,

1802
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,190
or who have,

1803
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:30,690
you know,

1804
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,090
one of my proudest stories is like,

1805
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:32,289
you know,

1806
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,889
help the kid get a part-time job.

1807
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:36,389
His parents had never had a job.

1808
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:38,190
His grandparents had never had a job.

1809
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,190
Now that one thing.

1810
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,889
Yeah.

1811
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:41,489
He then,

1812
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,289
so then we picked out a savings account for him.

1813
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:44,489
We've got a super fund,

1814
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:44,789
you know,

1815
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:48,190
that is the start of something for him.

1816
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:48,489
So yeah,

1817
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:49,889
that the curiosity is,

1818
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:50,389
is what I,

1819
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:50,789
that's,

1820
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:51,590
that's what drives me.

1821
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:51,789
Yeah.

1822
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:52,389
It's brilliant,

1823
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:52,690
uh,

1824
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:53,590
way to describe it.

1825
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:53,789
And I,

1826
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:55,190
and I think when you're talking paper,

1827
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,489
I think someone like me,

1828
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:58,889
financial acumen is a blind spot.

1829
00:46:58,889 --> 00:46:59,289
And,

1830
00:46:59,289 --> 00:46:59,690
and,

1831
00:46:59,690 --> 00:46:59,889
you know,

1832
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:01,289
I've been fortunate in my life to do things.

1833
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:04,889
I love that have come from a small business family though.

1834
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:05,190
Yeah,

1835
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,789
correct.

1836
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:06,090
But,

1837
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,289
but just that understanding day to day,

1838
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:09,389
isn't a natural thing,

1839
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:10,489
not something I enjoy.

1840
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:10,690
Yeah.

1841
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,690
It's a chore.

1842
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:11,789
Yeah.

1843
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:15,289
And then you're looking then for trusted support to collaborate with.

1844
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:17,690
And so when you hear someone like you,

1845
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,389
that that just is in your DNA and what you do every day,

1846
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:22,590
but for people to try and find that,

1847
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,590
or to pass that onto their kids is such a powerful thing.

1848
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:25,989
And,

1849
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:26,190
you know,

1850
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,789
we're talking about communication and,

1851
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:28,789
and you've got,

1852
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:30,590
you've got this very clear way.

1853
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,190
You mentioned before we worked together doing radio in Melbourne for 10 years.

1854
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:40,789
I almost need to apologize because we would hijack your segment and somehow try and turn it from finance into talking about,

1855
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:40,989
you know,

1856
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,289
strippers somehow.

1857
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:43,989
I mentioned Nick Malloy there.

1858
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,889
I'm blaming Malloy more than my good self,

1859
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:46,989
but I did play along.

1860
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,289
You did.

1861
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:48,889
So,

1862
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:51,889
but you've had a very clear way of getting a message.

1863
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:53,690
Was that something that you had naturally,

1864
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,590
or have you worked really hard on how you communicate with clarity?

1865
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:56,889
Yeah.

1866
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:57,090
I mean,

1867
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,289
I,

1868
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:58,090
I do,

1869
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,690
I work hard.

1870
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,789
It's hard to do it.

1871
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:03,889
It was something that I think you play to your strengths and I've always had this.

1872
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:07,889
I think that was something that I learned early on,

1873
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:08,289
but yeah,

1874
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:09,489
it's a lot of hard work.

1875
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:09,789
You know,

1876
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:10,889
the book was,

1877
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:11,789
um,

1878
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,090
was,

1879
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,190
it was hard work.

1880
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,989
Every line,

1881
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:15,289
I sweated over every line.

1882
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:15,590
Really?

1883
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:15,889
Yeah.

1884
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:15,989
And,

1885
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:16,190
you know,

1886
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,190
the funny thing was,

1887
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,590
um,

1888
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,090
after I wrote it,

1889
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:19,389
um,

1890
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:21,389
I would have people that would come to me and go,

1891
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:22,690
I saw what you did there.

1892
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,489
I'm going to write that.

1893
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:24,789
I'm going to write a book like that.

1894
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:25,690
That's easy.

1895
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:25,989
I'm like,

1896
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:26,389
sure.

1897
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:26,590
Go,

1898
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,289
go and do it.

1899
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:27,590
I'm not,

1900
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,489
I'm not saying that I'm,

1901
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:28,889
I'm,

1902
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,690
I'm,

1903
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:29,889
you know,

1904
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:30,789
I'm gifted or anything,

1905
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:31,389
but I'm just like,

1906
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:36,289
you should try and do it because it's actually a lot harder than you think.

1907
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,889
Like trying to make things really simple.

1908
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,090
It's a really,

1909
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,889
it can be really difficult to try and get some support with that.

1910
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,090
Or did you just work it out?

1911
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,789
You just trial and error.

1912
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,789
Something about writing for,

1913
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:49,489
you know,

1914
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:50,989
the Herald Sun,

1915
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:51,190
you know,

1916
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,889
back in the early days before blogs and all that,

1917
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,190
cause it was probably pre that.

1918
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,489
There's nothing like getting brutal feedback.

1919
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:01,489
From tabloid newspaper readers that toughens you up.

1920
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:03,789
So I've been called everything under the sun and,

1921
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:04,389
and stuff.

1922
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:04,590
And,

1923
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,190
and that sort of,

1924
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,690
I learned,

1925
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,690
it was a really great training ground for me to learn how to craft my message.

1926
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,190
I find it hard to think a news limited executive would be brutal.

1927
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:12,489
Pay me.

1928
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:12,789
That's a,

1929
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:13,889
that's a stretch,

1930
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:14,690
uh,

1931
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,190
um,

1932
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,289
tongue firmly in cheek clearly on that one.

1933
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,989
A collaboration is a,

1934
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:19,489
is a trait.

1935
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,590
We're saying modern leaders are great collaborators and they seek out,

1936
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:23,789
uh,

1937
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:24,889
collaboration regularly.

1938
00:49:24,889 --> 00:49:24,989
And,

1939
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:25,289
you know,

1940
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:27,190
I mentioned a lot of your stuff has been you,

1941
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,190
the barefoot.

1942
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,090
How do you approach collaboration?

1943
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:30,690
Well,

1944
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,590
um,

1945
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,889
with great difficulty,

1946
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:33,489
actually,

1947
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:34,690
I'll be really honest with you.

1948
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:34,989
I mean,

1949
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:35,889
I,

1950
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,289
again,

1951
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,590
I'm a solo machine.

1952
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,489
I've been able to basically,

1953
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:40,690
um,

1954
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:40,889
uh,

1955
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:43,789
sit at my farm and do what I do.

1956
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:44,090
Um,

1957
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:47,989
and so therefore it was a real fish out of water thing of actually having to

1958
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:53,989
engage every state education minister and the various education bodies.

1959
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:54,889
Um,

1960
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:55,489
and it was,

1961
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:56,989
it was in some instances quite frustrating,

1962
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,889
because I'm like,

1963
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:00,590
I'm no good at most things.

1964
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,289
I am literally hopeless at most things.

1965
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:07,789
But one thing I kind of do know is how to communicate financial education.

1966
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:11,489
I had all these people telling me like ripping my stuff to shreds.

1967
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:11,989
And,

1968
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:12,289
um,

1969
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:13,690
it was quite difficult,

1970
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:14,190
um,

1971
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:19,289
to try and collaborate with not just one education,

1972
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:19,690
uh,

1973
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,289
department,

1974
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:20,989
but you know,

1975
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,190
all around the country.

1976
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,690
So your solution to that is now bypass them,

1977
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,989
the middleman go direct to kids.

1978
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:27,389
And is that,

1979
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:27,989
is that what you,

1980
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,989
you say the best path forward for you to,

1981
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:30,389
to,

1982
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:30,989
to get your message?

1983
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:31,690
Yeah.

1984
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:31,989
I mean,

1985
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:32,489
what I,

1986
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:33,989
what I said to them was,

1987
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,489
um,

1988
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,489
I don't need this to be about my name.

1989
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:36,989
I'm happy.

1990
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:37,389
I don't,

1991
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:38,789
I don't need to be paid.

1992
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:40,090
I just think this is really important.

1993
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,590
And I gave them my materials.

1994
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,989
Some of them were a little risky,

1995
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:45,489
um,

1996
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:47,090
because for the teenagers,

1997
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:47,489
um,

1998
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:48,590
I had Nazeem Hussein,

1999
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,489
the comedian and I,

2000
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:50,889
we had lots of fun,

2001
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,489
but I think you have to push the boundaries in order to,

2002
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:55,989
to sort of engage teenagers.

2003
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:56,889
So I've given them all,

2004
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:57,789
all my content.

2005
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:58,090
Um,

2006
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,389
I've said that I'll help in any way that I can because I'm really passionate about it.

2007
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:03,289
But just having that time for reflection,

2008
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:03,590
I'm like,

2009
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:04,389
you know,

2010
00:51:04,389 --> 00:51:05,789
you got to play to your strengths.

2011
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:06,989
And I think for me,

2012
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:13,190
my strength is actually writing or communicating in a way that someone opens a book and,

2013
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,090
and I'm talking directly to you.

2014
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,690
And if I can hold your attention,

2015
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,090
which is a really hard thing to do,

2016
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,690
and I don't always succeed,

2017
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,889
but if I can do that,

2018
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:26,289
I can really help lots of kids.

2019
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:26,489
Well,

2020
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,789
we'll watch and read with interest the new book.

2021
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:31,889
It'll be brilliant as always with what you do.

2022
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:36,090
And we started talking about the cards you've got and you know yours as well as anyone else.

2023
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:42,090
We've been asking these two questions of all the great leaders and I see you as a great leader in your space.

2024
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,389
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

2025
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:47,889
I think the greatest leader in my life.

2026
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,590
Um,

2027
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,389
well,

2028
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:52,289
I would say my parents,

2029
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:53,190
obviously,

2030
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,690
my dad sat me down and,

2031
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,389
and,

2032
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:56,389
and paid me,

2033
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,989
in one BHP share,

2034
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,289
which blew my mind as a little kid,

2035
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:00,489
you know,

2036
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,389
in and,

2037
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:02,590
you know,

2038
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,789
just having as I get older and deal with different people,

2039
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:11,989
having two parents that loved each other and that loved me is such a huge step up in life.

2040
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:12,489
Um,

2041
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:14,090
because not everyone gets it.

2042
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:14,889
Um,

2043
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:15,989
Warren Buffett,

2044
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:16,489
uh,

2045
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:16,889
the,

2046
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:18,489
who we've just spoken about,

2047
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:18,789
um,

2048
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:20,889
I've met a couple of times.

2049
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,289
How much time have you had with,

2050
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:22,489
uh,

2051
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:22,690
not,

2052
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,389
not enough.

2053
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:23,690
Yeah,

2054
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:23,989
not enough.

2055
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:24,590
The time is,

2056
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,489
is very valuable.

2057
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:26,090
But you,

2058
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,789
you're a regular pilgrim to,

2059
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:28,289
uh,

2060
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:29,389
Omaha.

2061
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:30,789
We're not going through pandemics.

2062
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:31,389
Um,

2063
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:32,090
and do you,

2064
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,489
do you enjoy that as much as for you?

2065
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,489
That that's your grand final,

2066
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:34,789
isn't it?

2067
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:35,590
My grand final mate.

2068
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,090
You love it,

2069
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:36,590
don't you?

2070
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:36,989
Yeah.

2071
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:37,289
And,

2072
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:37,489
and,

2073
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,889
and is the wisdom still,

2074
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,489
is he's over 90 now?

2075
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:40,789
Yeah,

2076
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:41,690
he's,

2077
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,889
what it is about him is that he has lived a very authentic life.

2078
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:46,190
You know,

2079
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:46,789
he,

2080
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:47,190
um,

2081
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,090
he has become the richest person on earth.

2082
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,789
He still lives in the same house that he,

2083
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:52,190
that,

2084
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,590
um,

2085
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,989
that he bought when he was a young person,

2086
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:55,289
um,

2087
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:55,989
loves his kids.

2088
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,789
And it has given all the money away.

2089
00:52:57,789 --> 00:52:58,989
And I think that is something,

2090
00:52:58,989 --> 00:52:59,190
you know,

2091
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,289
I,

2092
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:00,989
you don't learn anything from,

2093
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:01,489
from me now.

2094
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:02,690
I don't learn anything,

2095
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,090
but it's that re it's like going to church,

2096
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,590
just reinforces that this is a guy who is the real deal.

2097
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,590
Money has not tainted him.

2098
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,090
Um,

2099
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,389
and he's made all this money,

2100
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,690
he's given it all away.

2101
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:14,989
And,

2102
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:16,889
and so that legacy I think is really interesting.

2103
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:23,489
And then the other one would be my wife who has supported me through deciding to go back to TAFE to be a mature age student and,

2104
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:23,989
you know,

2105
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:25,789
drinking beer on a Thursday in the college,

2106
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:26,289
uh,

2107
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:26,590
uh,

2108
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,289
lawns when she's at home with the kids and stuff and supporting me with all the stuff that I've done.

2109
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:31,989
And,

2110
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:32,389
and yeah,

2111
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:32,989
it's been good.

2112
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,889
So we are into the world of collaboration.

2113
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:37,989
I love that you are honest enough to say that it's hard for you and that's what,

2114
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:38,190
you know,

2115
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,789
tread your own path authentically yourself.

2116
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:43,190
But if you could collaborate with anyone,

2117
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,989
is it in anything?

2118
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,489
And it mightn't be finance.

2119
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,889
It might be you've wanted to write a song with someone or is there any collaboration that,

2120
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:50,789
that would jump out at you?

2121
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:51,090
Well,

2122
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:51,289
I mean,

2123
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:55,590
I think that the thing that I'm always interested in is,

2124
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,190
um,

2125
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:56,590
you know,

2126
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,289
the space that I'm in.

2127
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:01,590
And one of the things that I would like to do that I haven't done yet,

2128
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:01,889
but I,

2129
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:09,190
but I'm interested in is I do believe that small business is the backbone of our country.

2130
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:18,489
And the one area that I haven't really focused on is that I think that there's not enough training and help for our small businesses.

2131
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,590
Anyone can set up a small business and you give it a go.

2132
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,690
And we all know that the majority of them fail and you learn by trial and error.

2133
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,489
But I do think,

2134
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:30,289
that there could be something that you could do that I would like to collaborate with,

2135
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:33,989
with somebody who has been very successful,

2136
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:37,989
that you could create something for small businesses.

2137
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:38,989
What I do is,

2138
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:39,889
um,

2139
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:40,190
uh,

2140
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,190
as part of my financial counseling is,

2141
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:42,389
um,

2142
00:54:42,389 --> 00:54:43,889
there's a small business debt helpline.

2143
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:48,889
A lot of small businesses get in trouble and I see the pain that that inflicts on not only the business owners,

2144
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:51,190
but the family and the kids.

2145
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,389
So there's something there I'd like to collaborate there to try and help,

2146
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:56,389
um,

2147
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,590
help those small businesses.

2148
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,190
Because they do it bloody tough and they work incredibly hard.

2149
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,090
You and I are both from small business families.

2150
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,690
You know how hard it is.

2151
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,090
That's something that I would like to do.

2152
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:06,590
But, you know,

2153
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,889
I'm just going to focus on the kids.

2154
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:09,389
Well, I'd love to see that happen,

2155
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:09,889
uh,

2156
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,190
Pepe,

2157
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:10,789
because it's,

2158
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:11,090
uh,

2159
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,389
it is close to my heart as well.

2160
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:13,789
Grew up in the hospitality industry,

2161
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:14,690
still,

2162
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,190
uh,

2163
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,989
actively,

2164
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:16,289
uh,

2165
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:17,389
involved in the hospitality industry.

2166
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:18,590
Hasn't made a lot of fun in Melbourne,

2167
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,090
you'd imagine,

2168
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,489
for the last couple of years.

2169
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:20,690
And,

2170
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:20,989
and,

2171
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:21,489
and you're right.

2172
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:21,989
It's one of those things.

2173
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,590
There's no playbook really hard to get,

2174
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,090
um,

2175
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,389
other people sharing their IP,

2176
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:30,690
hoping there's going to be a better sharing economy in that space.

2177
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:31,090
And there's a,

2178
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:31,690
there's a lot,

2179
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,489
we inflict a,

2180
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:33,889
it's sort of like finance.

2181
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:34,389
We,

2182
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:35,190
we suppose,

2183
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,389
presuppose a lot of knowledge.

2184
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:36,590
So,

2185
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:36,889
you know,

2186
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,090
that you got these kids coming out,

2187
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:38,590
they're 18,

2188
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:38,789
they're,

2189
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:39,489
they've got a,

2190
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:42,989
supposed to know what health insurance is and super and all this stuff.

2191
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:44,590
And with employees,

2192
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,389
we expect them,

2193
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:46,889
you've got to have all these regulations,

2194
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:47,590
the pay grades,

2195
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,889
all these things.

2196
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:51,889
And you're trying to make a buck and you've got all these other regulations.

2197
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:54,090
Something that actually mentors and helps those people.

2198
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,989
I know there are programs,

2199
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:56,289
programs around,

2200
00:55:56,289 --> 00:56:01,090
but I would just like to try and work with someone who really has a deep knowledge and skill in that.

2201
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,489
And that's not me,

2202
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:06,590
but to try and create something that can give value because I think small business owners are the,

2203
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,889
are the backbone of our community.

2204
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:09,489
What a great idea.

2205
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:11,389
And I'm sure knowing you,

2206
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:15,190
that is only a matter of time before you make a big impact in that space.

2207
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,190
And as I said,

2208
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:16,590
off the top,

2209
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:22,590
