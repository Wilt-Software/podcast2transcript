1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,700
I was fortunate enough to be joined by Scott Pape on an earlier episode of the podcast,

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,279
which we'll link to in the show notes. So after you've listened to Scotty Pape's take on the

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,260
current situation Australians are facing in their financial lives, I highly recommend you go back

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,859
to the first conversation we had with Scott, where he tells the story of his journey to become the

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,859
barefoot investor and his impact on personal finance in Australia. It's a remarkable story.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,160
He talks about the importance of teaching financial literacy in schools and where the

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,039
Department of Education has got it wrong. His decision to give away his business and instead

8
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,359
provide financial education for free as a TAFE-trained financial counsellor is an incredible

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,060
contribution. His passion for supporting and training small businesses, he refers to small

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,380
businesses as the backbone of the country. So I encourage you to go back and listen to the

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,899
original episode with Scott Pape, the barefoot investor. But first, I know you're going to get

12
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,560
so much out of this update with Scotty Pape, where he talks about his work, again, as a financial

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,140
counsellor for Australians who are struggling with financial difficulties. So I encourage you to go

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,760
find a way to put a roof over their family's head and to get healthy meals on the table. He also

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,079
addresses the sneaky tactics of superannuation funds and tells us what we need to do to stay

16
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,359
in control of our own super. And he puts forward his unique approach for how best to talk to kids

17
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,400
about the household budget. It's incredible people like Scott Pape, the barefoot investor,

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,340
who inspire our work at Alita. I'd love you to check out our signature program, Alita Connect.

like this with Scotty Pape. If you haven't invested in a mattress like Temper, it's a

24
00:01:51,459 --> 00:02:02,780
mattress like no other. I encourage you to check it out today. Scott Pape, the barefoot investor,

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,340
is a great champion for helping Australians manage their financial well-being. He

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,199
tears his time to support Australians in financial distress, lobbies governments to support better

27
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,659
financial literacy for our kids. He's a very passionate and proud father of four who lives

28
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:23,240
on his farm in country Victoria, where I'm talking to him from today. Pape, thanks for joining me for

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,080
a second time. It's the first time I've circled back around to a guest on this podcast for a

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,719
second time. I love catching up with you. I really appreciate you joining me today.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
Thanks, Gus. Good to be here.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,060
Now, the cost of living crisis, I want to start there, Pape. It's real. Can you give a sense of

33
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,620
just how it works?

34
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,379
How tough it is out there for the average person today?

35
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,520
Well, that's a really interesting point. What is the average Australian? I mean,

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,840
we saw with the phase three tax cuts, people on $200,000 a year are saying,

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,740
we're doing it tough. Everyone's doing it tough. I think that the problem is that most people hang

38
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,719
around with people on the same income as them. I've got a bit of a unique insight because I

39
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,919
actually help people who are really struggling. So single parents, you're in lots of debt.

40
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,080
And often I'll sit there and talk to them about a budget where we're trying to make

41
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:14,819
$10 stretch. We're talking about putting food on the table for their kids. So I guess the insight

42
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,699
for me is when I hear about the word cost of living, what I think of is housing, right?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,020
That is the number one thing that is the issue in Australia right now. If you've owned your house

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,319
for about five years, generally speaking, you're doing okay because the housing prices, as we all

45
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,479
know, have gone up. You've built up a bit of equity. That's not to say that you're not struggling

46
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,379
day to day.

47
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,860
We know most Australians are struggling day to day, especially if you've got kids in private

48
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,159
school and all those sorts of things. But generally speaking, that big block of owning

49
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,439
your own home and having some equity there, you're doing okay. It's the people that have

50
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,479
just bought their home in the last, say, three to five years that have caught those 13 rate rises

51
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:05,639
that we were never supposed to get. And it's those people, especially who are renting that

52
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,379
are really struggling right now.

53
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,800
I mean, rental affordability is the worst on record. They say it's at a crisis when it's

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,060
one, one and a half percent vacancy rate. We're at 0.8 of a percent right now. So if you're a single

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:29,079
parent or if you're earning the average income, what we are finding, I was reading a report that

56
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:34,899
basically said there's almost zero properties that are considered affordable for the lowest

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,879
income, the lowest 30% income.

58
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:44,079
Well, if you're in that situation, that is where cost of living is really biting. If you're a single

59
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,180
mum and you've just been told that your rent's going up 200 bucks a month, that is a crisis.

60
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,680
That is what we're seeing. Yeah. So for me, if I'm looking at the cost of living, I think housing.

61
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,779
And I don't think either political party really has an answer to that. And if they don't have

62
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,620
an answer to that, it means it's just going to keep going the way it's going. They won't look

63
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,560
at tax breaks.

64
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,220
Negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, which favours rich people like you

65
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:21,279
and me, Das. So I'm talking against my own book here, but I find it strange that we are basically

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,399
favouring investors versus young people getting to their first home. I think there's a lack of

67
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:36,120
supply. And I also think that bringing 500,000 new migrants to Australia, when you've got a rental

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,620
crisis, there's a lack of supply. And I also think that bringing 500,000 new migrants to Australia,

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,100
there's not enough rental properties. And it's basically the whole market is cooked. I don't

70
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,959
see how that's helping things. And Pepe, you look at coming out of

71
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:56,220
COVID, for me, the divide has never been bigger. The top 1% of wealth in the world now own more

72
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,019
than the next 50%. And if you had money going into COVID, you've made more money. And just

73
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:06,899
seeing that that has got bigger and bigger, as you said, someone who's now

74
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,000
not got a possibility to rent a house and has got no margin for error. And then you've got the elite

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,779
wealth that have got this obscene amount of wealth. I mean, how big a problem is that in your mind?

76
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:23,959
We are the 1%. Australia, according to Credit Suisse, is the wealthiest nation on earth.

77
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,540
We are the lucky country, but we're also the lucky country where 3.7 million households

78
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,259
don't have enough money for food on the table. We are also the country where you've got anyone

79
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,060
under the age of...

80
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,160
30 and living in a capital city is basically giving up trying to buy a house, especially if

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,839
you live in Sydney. We live in a country where probably the most important workers, so teachers,

82
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:56,699
nurses, police, fireys, they can't afford a home in a capital city without overextending

83
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,800
themselves and really stressing themselves out. Some of the toughest emails I get are from people

84
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,600
who did the right thing. They saved, they bought a house, they bought a house, they bought a house,

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,500
and now they've just copped these rate rises, and they're really struggling. As you and I talk

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,959
about, Das, for many, many years, you buy a house, you get married, and you have kids. It's a very

87
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,399
expensive time. It's a very stressful time in your life. So I just kind of feel it's not really the

88
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:33,399
1% because by living in Australia, owning a home, you are in the 1% anyway. It's really that

89
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,579
generational divide of people that are priced out of the property market or are priced out of the

90
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:45,279
property market right now and are overextended. That's, for me, where the divide happens. I think

91
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,000
Australia is becoming a very uneven country, and I don't think this is going to bode well for this

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,399
country going forward. I think it is good context to have that perspective of being in the 1% and

93
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,279
being in that fortunate position, but wanting to have this conversation, maybe a sense of empathy

94
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,519
that is out there at the moment. I know this is a hard question to answer, but I like asking,

95
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,160
of you, and I'm not sure there's an easy answer to it, but how much is enough money? You've got

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,139
access to do things that could make you five times as wealthy if you really wanted to be,

97
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,279
but you make choices to live a balanced life. I like talking to you about that. How much do you

98
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,519
think is enough money for someone to live a healthy and happy life? Well, generally, it comes

99
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,080
back to what I said. Most people only hang out with people who earn the same amount of money as

100
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,580
them or more. There's a saying that if Bill Gates woke up and

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,240
only had Oprah's wealth, he'd jump out the window. It's all relative. It's the people

102
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,299
that you hang out with. I'm kind of lucky in that I live on this farm. A lot of my work deals with

103
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:56,279
people who are really struggling. For me, it's a real reality check and a gratitude check of just

104
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,840
how lucky I am because I am dealing with people who are really struggling. I think it's different

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,820
for everyone. I think it's a lot less than you think. However, that whole money doesn't buy

106
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,440
happiness.

107
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,559
It's true beyond a certain level, but I can tell you the people that I deal with that are

108
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,860
being necked with a couple of hundred bucks extra rent from their landlord, that's miserable.

109
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,740
That is misery. If you're a young couple and you're going to auctions every weekend and you're

110
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,620
seeing prices just bit out of your control, that's miserable. The idea for me of the lucky country is

111
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,580
that I can buy a house that I can afford, that I don't have to get myself into a house that I can

112
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,559
into serious debt for, and that I can live a good life and contribute to society. That figure is

113
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,080
going to be different. It's said that beyond $70,000, it doesn't increase your happiness.

114
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,120
For me, it's about security. If I've got a house that I like, it may not be the biggest house,

115
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:59,860
it may not be the Kardashians, you name it, but if it's my little house and I can afford it and I

116
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:07,179
can afford to take time off work and if I can choose to do a job that I enjoy doing and I have

117
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:07,559
time to do it, I can afford it. I can afford to take time off work and if I can choose to do a job that I enjoy doing and I have time to do it, I can afford to do it.

118
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,379
I can afford to go to my kid's footy game and all those sorts of things. Any money beyond that,

119
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,100
as you and I know, isn't going to make you any happier. You and I both know people that are

120
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,220
very wealthy that aren't the happiest. For me, it's all about financial security.

121
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,220
At that end of the scale, there's an enormous amount of greed in the world. I think I've said

122
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,919
this to you before, some of the unhappiest people I've met are the kids of the super wealthy that

123
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:37,419
inherited too much money and haven't ever had to think about working. I think Warren Buffett's

124
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,679
a great person in your life. I know you're a devotee of his thinking and I think he is famous

125
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,639
for paying for his kids' education and almost nothing else. I think the quote is,

126
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:51,539
I want to leave my kids enough they can do anything, but not enough that they can do

127
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:58,460
nothing. You choose to take your kids on caravan trips and you go to Europe in a caravan. You

128
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,220
could take them on six-star trips if you wanted to. Why is that so important for you?

129
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,259
Well, it's just that whole thing. I was very lucky to… Warren Buffett, for those who don't know,

130
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,500
is one of the wealthiest people in the world.

131
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,519
He generally has been number one.

132
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
He's sort of in the top five.

133
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,259
He's sort of like the Melbourne demons of the wealth group.

134
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,419
And I actually was fortunate enough to spend five –

135
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,840
He's worth $100 billion plus, Pape, isn't he, for some perspective, isn't it?

136
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:24,679
More than $100 billion.

137
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,539
I was lucky enough to spend time with his son.

138
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,179
My thing is that you can – if you're a rich dude, if you're mega rich,

139
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,919
you can spin a line and the media will eat it up.

140
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,500
You've got enough money to basically create your own image in the media.

141
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,820
But you can't fudge your kids, right?

142
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,519
And I spent a day with Peter, his son.

143
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,820
What I found to him to be was just a really humble guy.

144
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,919
He grew up in a house that was a suburban house in Omaha.

145
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,399
He walked to school.

146
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,759
He went to a public school.

147
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,340
He was just a genuinely lovely, very centred guy.

148
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,240
And as you and I both know, I've dealt with a lot of –

149
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,399
trust fund kids and they are some of the most screwed up people you know.

150
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,460
So for me, I kind of looked at it and went, I want my kids to be like that.

151
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,100
It's important for me that my kids are hardworking and that they're generous

152
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,299
and a farm here is a really great place for kids to grow up.

153
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,399
But again, you know, I'm the first to say that I'm very privileged as well.

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,740
You know, I've been able to give my kids experiences that other kids can't.

155
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,700
For me, it's really important.

156
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,379
It's probably the most important thing that I'm doing.

157
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:42,019
You're hugely passionate about basic financial literacy and not being taught in schools.

158
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,039
You wrote a brilliant book about this specifically for families.

159
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,559
So what's the best message you give to support families to enable us to help

160
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,559
with a better financial wellbeing future for our kids?

161
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
You know what I think is really interesting?

162
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,840
And I've been reflecting on this.

163
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,360
As we are coming – as those rate rises have gone up, you can –

164
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,220
I get hundreds if not thousands of letters from people.

165
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,220
And I can –

166
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,240
I can feel the stress that people have because we all know that, you know,

167
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,360
the Reserve Bank said, just go out and borrow.

168
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,200
It's fine.

169
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,379
Rates aren't going up.

170
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,779
And then bang, bang, bang, bang, all these rate rises came up

171
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,620
and no one was expecting it.

172
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,220
And so there's a lot of stress in households right now.

173
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,519
And so the thing that I have been reflecting on is often what we want

174
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,039
to do is hide our kids from those stresses.

175
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
We don't want them to know that mum and dad are worried

176
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
about money or are anxious.

177
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,740
And, of course, you know, it's got to be age appropriate.

178
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,240
But I think having those real conversations with your kids

179
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,179
is actually really important.

180
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,240
You know, once they sort of – older primary school,

181
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,559
but certainly high school, talking about what's going on,

182
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,679
letting them see how you are going, you are resilient

183
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,980
and how you're overcoming them.

184
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
Because the thing is you can't hide it from the kids.

185
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,159
They know when things are tough.

186
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,419
So for me it's having those conversations.

187
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,100
You may not want to bust out your credit card bill and show them

188
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,259
or anything, but just giving them an understanding of what it's like

189
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,639
to live through this period of time where arguably we've got some

190
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,159
of the most indebted households in the world.

191
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,600
We're really struggling, a lot of families.

192
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,220
I think that is something that will stick through with kids.

193
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,899
That's something that they're going to learn.

194
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,799
But again, for me, just in those sort of younger years

195
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,700
where the concrete's still sitting on their –

196
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:43,679
on their personality, that idea of working hard, doing jobs and giving, understanding that they're

197
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,039
doing pretty well. And that's why that sort of that food bank thing that I spoke about,

198
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,539
I love giving the food bank because it's really tangible for kids. They know what it's like when

199
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:58,039
they haven't eaten, when they've missed breakfast, they get a rumbly tummy. And, you know, the

200
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,980
chances are that a couple of kids in their classroom haven't had breakfast. You know,

201
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:09,820
if we've got 3.7 million households that are kind of struggling to put food in the fridge,

202
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:15,200
there's a fairly good chance, my kids go to a local public school, that there's a couple of

203
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,480
kids there. And they really understand that. So just building that empathy and that hard work,

204
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,000
that's all we want. We just want our kids to be hardworking and generous.

205
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,759
I love how you simplify that. And it's true, isn't it? Putting that into practice and

206
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,159
trying to teach empathy is something that we can

207
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,960
think about.

208
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,539
I think about the share market as a pretty complex thing at times,

209
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,759
Papi. It's your world, you know it really well. For a lot of us, it's hard. How do you start?

210
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,200
Where do you get the knowledge to even, I suppose, start investing? Should everyone in your mind

211
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,779
that can save a few dollars be investing in the share market in some way?

212
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, Darcy, I think I'll backtrack there and say that I think it's deliberately confusing.

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,820
And I think it serves an industry.

214
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,759
An entire industry called the superannuation industry for you to think that and to not think

215
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,360
about your super fund and not even think about it until you're 55 or 60. You know, they would

216
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,600
really like it that if you just paid no attention to it. So they could just, you know, they could

217
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,720
charge you as much as they can. They don't want it. They don't want you turning up to the meetings

218
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,240
and asking why you're spending money on this, that and the other thing. You know, so for me,

219
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,799
the first question is,

220
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,980
is you are already an investor. If you've got superannuation, you're already an investor,

221
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,840
whether you like it or not. If you're working, you've got super. Now, one of the things that

222
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,320
you find that I, a lot of the stuff you read in the newspapers and on TV are from financial advisors

223
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,159
or wealth companies. And they'll say, you're going to have a million bucks to invest. You're

224
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,360
going to have 2 million bucks, you know, to retire, or you're going to end up, you know,

225
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,620
chomping grass out here like a sheep.

226
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,779
I had a look at it.

227
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:08,920
Right. And I did the figures. And what I found was the average retirement balance for a man in

228
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:17,660
Australia. So the median, which is the midpoint is $211,000. That median retirement balance for

229
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:26,680
a woman is about $158,000. So that is middle Australia, right? But here's the thing. Those

230
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,779
people don't get to spend that $211,000 or $158,000. They don't get to spend that $211,000.

231
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:38,559
Because the majority of them have still got debt. So they've got to take that money. And they've got

232
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,859
to pay down their debt, which we know is quadrupled over the last, you know, 20 years,

233
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:55,000
household debts have. So for me, I'm just focusing on the young people who are going into work now,

234
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,579
saying, you really need to pay some attention to your super and to your

235
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:09,460
savings. Because a little bit of effort there can literally change your life as you get older.

236
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,319
Again, I love the simplicity of the message. And you teach families a lot about that, isn't it?

237
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,019
Spending less than you earn and living within your means and a happiness that comes with

238
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,700
not necessarily having to keep up with the neighbours as we talk about a lot. Do we need

239
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,220
to teach governments the same paper? You and I live in a city called Melbourne. You're slightly

240
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
out of town.

241
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,180
On the farm, but you look at the debt levels that Victoria has accumulated,

242
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,819
record numbers, the combined totals of other states combined, I'll get the number wrong,

243
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,700
but $370 billion worth of debt. I think last time I had a look or thereabouts,

244
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,640
as someone who knows this space well, should we be alarmed that our governments have borrowed

245
00:18:51,640 --> 00:19:00,279
at that level? Or is it okay? Look, I try not to get into politics. So for me, I guess that

246
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,779
the best analogy I can give is that I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician. I'm not a

247
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,579
politician. I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician. I'm not

248
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:11,359
a politician. I can have, I don't know, let's say that's 20 acres behind me, right? I can

249
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,160
have 20 sheep in there and do pretty well. And I can keep putting sheep in there and

250
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,000
earn more and more money. But the problem is, is eventually I'm going to have not enough

251
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,240
grass there and people are going to be unhappy. It's a similar thing with what's going on

252
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,619
with government debts and the population growth that we're having right now.

253
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,940
For me, though, what I focus on is the things that I can control.

254
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't control the Victorian state debt, which does worry me.

255
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,559
I can't control what politicians do.

256
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,200
I will say that the difference between, say, America and, you know,

257
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,279
TikTok, Instagram, we all get all these gurus from America

258
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,619
and we often don't see the difference between Australia and America.

259
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:03,180
The big difference with Australia is in America,

260
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,160
the government's got all the debt.

261
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,019
In Australia, we have all the debt.

262
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,299
It's our households that have all the debt.

263
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,220
So for me, I'm just focusing on the things that I can control,

264
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,599
and that is I have no control over the government.

265
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,339
They do some pretty silly things, but for me,

266
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,420
it's more about what can I do for my family to make sure

267
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,339
that we've got enough.

268
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,599
And, Poppy, I'll go back to the social divide.

269
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,799
Again, for me, which I find sort of scary,

270
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,460
that if people have next to nothing, you do become desperate.

271
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,099
And if you have no sense that there's hope to find your way out of it

272
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,019
and the numbers you just articulated, 3.7 million households

273
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:46,700
who are struggling with their food bill, that's a crisis on every level

274
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,779
in a population size of the country that we live in in Australia.

275
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,920
I mean, if you could wave a magic wand to get more equality,

276
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:56,660
is there a fix?

277
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,559
Is there something that you would do?

278
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,420
If you could just, as I said, find a way to influence it?

279
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,559
I mean, I've looked at a couple of things.

280
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,160
I mean, I think the first thing is that we need to have more housing

281
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,359
for single parents and people who are vulnerable.

282
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,200
And there are people that that doesn't fit their political ideology.

283
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,599
But for me, it's not just about those parents.

284
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
It's about the kids coming through.

285
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:26,180
And so what I've tried to focus on is kind of three things.

286
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,180
So the first one is finance.

287
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,220
Financial education.

288
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,440
Because we all know that financial education is that one thing

289
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,980
that changes your behaviour.

290
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,460
So we expect a lot from people.

291
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,680
We know that probably half of Australia, thereabouts,

292
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,160
don't have the basic financial skills to operate in life.

293
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,460
They can't work out percentages.

294
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
They don't really understand super.

295
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,819
They've got no idea about private health cover, none of that.

296
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,700
So we expect young people to actually understand this stuff.

297
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,539
And so I think financial education,

298
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:59,299
is one thing.

299
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,319
The second one is you've got to help the battlers.

300
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,299
You've got to help the people who are harder.

301
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:07,000
And if you don't, if you want to see what that looks like,

302
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,900
if you don't go to America, see how well that's working out for them

303
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:18,660
by treating those really poor people like they're just a piece of dirt, basically.

304
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,279
And then the third thing that I've done is I have this thing.

305
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm going to give you a plug.

306
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,299
It's the Small Business Debt Helpline.

307
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,619
So I helped set this up coming out of just before COVID.

308
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:28,319
So I helped set this up coming out of just before COVID.

309
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:28,420
So I helped set this up coming out of just before COVID.

310
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,519
So I helped set this up coming out of just before COVID.

311
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,660
It's specifically for small businesses that are struggling, that have got debts.

312
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,039
We all know, you and I are both small business owners, hardworking people.

313
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,660
They're not doing it to earn millions of bucks.

314
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,940
They're doing it because they're passionate.

315
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,660
It's generally a family business.

316
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,559
Generally, banks don't lend to small businesses.

317
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,039
What they'll do is they'll just say, well, we'll borrow against the house.

318
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,359
We'll borrow against your assets.

319
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,740
And so they end up getting into a lot of trouble.

320
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,420
So if there are people that are struggling,

321
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,660
that are struggling, that are watching or listening right now,

322
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,680
that are small business owners that are feeling the pinch,

323
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,259
there is help at hand.

324
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,539
It's called the Small Business Debt Helpline,

325
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,359
something that I'm really proud of that we helped set up.

326
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,220
It's 1-800-413-828.

327
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,660
That's 1-800-413-828.

328
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,779
And again, I'm a financial counsellor.

329
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,220
Anyone who's struggling with their debts, feeling out of control,

330
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,680
don't do it alone.

331
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,460
Call 1-800-007-007.

332
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,400
You'll meet up with a financial counsellor.

333
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:29,559
It's a free service.

334
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,460
It's independent.

335
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,279
And it'll help you get back on your feet.

336
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,500
That's why I admire you, Papy, as much as anyone.

337
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,900
I think you've got integrity that other people haven't even thought of before.

338
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,299
We could spend this time plugging the book that sold more copies

339
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,339
than any other book in Australian history.

340
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,680
But you're always thinking about giving back and helping small businesses.

341
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,980
We'll make sure we put those numbers in all of the show notes post this.

342
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,900
And there are people there that can help.

343
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,559
It is an incredibly tough time.

344
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,339
But I love the fact that you've got someone like you, Papy,

345
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,240
who's a voice for people.

346
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,279
That haven't got a voice in this space.

347
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,259
So I really appreciate you jumping on again, mate.

348
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,799
I know there's a lot happening in your world.

349
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,180
But I appreciate the update and some sound advice, as always,

350
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,680
for people who are doing it particularly tough at the moment.

351
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:11,299
Thanks again, mate.

352
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Thanks, Darce.

353
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,880
