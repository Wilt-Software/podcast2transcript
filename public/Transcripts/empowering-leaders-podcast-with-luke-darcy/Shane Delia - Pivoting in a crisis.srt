00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,899
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,300
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:52,329
Shane Dillier is one of the most recognisable faces

12
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,570
in the Australian food and hospitality scene.

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,829
He is best known as the director of the Dillier Group

14
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,210
which encompasses restaurants Maha, Maha East, Maha Bar, Biggie Smalls

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,229
and Middle Ground.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,569
The hospitality industry in Melbourne, Shane's hometown,

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,849
faced an unprecedented level of distress through the COVID period,

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,069
essentially being locked down without meaningful trade

19
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,310
for the best part of two years.

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,430
Shane's creative response in founding food delivery marketplace Provador

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,290
is a game changer for the industry.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,890
Bringing top tier restaurants to doorsteps across the country.

23
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,349
Provador's ready to finish meals are shaping the future

24
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,590
of how the hospitality industry will thrive into the future.

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,989
Shane has an extensive media presence as a television presenter,

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,549
print contributor, author, charity and brand ambassador.

27
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,969
It's always great to catch up with you, Shane.

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,769
Thanks for joining me, mate.

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,709
I like that intro.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,269
I've got to put some time into it, mate, because you are a bit of a machine.

31
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,549
It's an expanding empire and it's a great story of success.

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,730
When you reflect back on it, what do you think?

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,909
I think I'm pretty lucky.

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,129
I think about even sitting here with you, mate.

35
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,390
I remember going on the footy and watching you take big grabs and kick goals

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,870
and bust your way through packs.

37
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,430
To be able to sit here and share a desk with you and have a relationship

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,930
and a friendship is really important.

39
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,830
I didn't think I'd achieve half the things I've achieved.

40
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,750
I didn't really have many goals, to be honest.

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,969
I just kept pushing through every day and things have eventuated.

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,629
You're a boy from the western suburbs of Melbourne and, as I said,

43
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:19,409
it's an incredible success.

44
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,650
When I think of you, Shane, the word grit comes to mind.

45
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,229
I think I'd back you to find a way, no matter what was thrown at you.

46
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,330
Can you describe where does that resilience and determination come from?

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,550
I think it comes from family.

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,069
I think it comes from the environment that you brought up in.

49
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,150
I think it comes from the stories of the people that you respect and trust.

50
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,810
My dad, I think, is a big inspiration in that.

51
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,009
He came to Australia, turned 18 on the boat coming over from Malta

52
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,289
to settle in a new country and then bring the rest of his family,

53
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,009
his brothers and sisters.

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,069
His parents over.

55
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:57,610
Then he was a very resourceful person, but he was always about giving.

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,189
He never worried about what he had or what he needed.

57
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:02,710
It was always about giving for everybody else.

58
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,129
I feel that weight on my shoulders.

59
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,669
I feel that everybody's given a lot.

60
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,069
My grandparents have given a lot.

61
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,509
My dad's given a lot for me to have some great opportunities.

62
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,530
I can't just go in half-assed.

63
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,409
If I'm going to go in, I have to go in and I have to make it work

64
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,389
because a lot of people sacrifice a lot to give me chances.

65
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,530
I want to make the most.

66
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,629
They're great migrant stories, aren't they?

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,030
I love that you've got that consciousness around the fact that those before you

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,490
did it really hard for you to have the life and your kids now.

69
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,550
You grew up in a pretty tough environment.

70
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,210
I've spoken to you about this before, Shane.

71
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,310
Some of your mates were getting into some pretty serious trouble

72
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,909
and there was a few sliding door moments in your life.

73
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,969
What was the influence, when you look back,

74
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,909
that got you onto the path that you are?

75
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,110
I think knowing that I had a community of people

76
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,750
that cared for me, around me.

77
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,150
I think that a lot of my other friends maybe didn't have that,

78
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,870
didn't have that support, didn't know that there was a line.

79
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,550
I pushed the line a few times and a couple of times

80
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,509
I stepped over the line, but I knew that if I did cross that line,

81
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,870
that I was impacting more than just me.

82
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,969
I was letting people down and it kept me on the straight and narrows.

83
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,009
I think a tough upbringing is important.

84
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,629
I think that people that whine on about it and say,

85
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,329
oh, it was tough for me, I'm like, yeah, well,

86
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,189
it's tough for a lot of people in a lot of different ways.

87
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,470
What do you learn from it?

88
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,050
How do you build resilience and then how do you carry that fuel,

89
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,050
whether it's negative energy or if it's positivity

90
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,269
or if it's just grit, as you say,

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,930
how do you actually use what you've learned through that adversity

92
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,189
to push forward?

93
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:36,490
I've tried to harness that.

94
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:39,269
Yeah, I'm big on that circle of influence in your life, Shane.

95
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,290
As you said, there was some opportunities to go one way

96
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,089
and a few of your mates did and ended up in some challenging situations,

97
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,209
but you always felt like,

98
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,089
the people close to you, you didn't want to let them down.

99
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,850
So even in that teenage space where you're taking a few risks,

100
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,870
you always had that sense that it was bigger than just you?

101
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,089
Yeah, I thought I was going to embarrass people.

102
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,670
I knew, look, my grandfather was the sergeant of the local police force

103
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,149
back home.

104
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,949
He was a man of pride and respect and I didn't want to bring any shame

105
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,310
onto our family's name.

106
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,810
I think that everybody sacrificed a lot to build that

107
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,610
and I didn't want to be that guy.

108
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,810
I didn't want to have to go home and look at my parents in the eye

109
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,269
and know that I've let them down.

110
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:21,990
And a few times I've had to face that and I still probably do.

111
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,949
But at the end of the day, that's a line I wasn't really willing to cross.

112
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,689
I think they'd be pretty proud of where life's ended up.

113
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,170
You find your way into the hospitality business.

114
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,649
It's a brutal industry.

115
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,730
A lot of people try, a lot of people fail.

116
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,470
What's been the secret to your success?

117
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,449
I think in the beginning, it was just, I didn't set huge goals for myself.

118
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,670
I just wanted to get in.

119
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,649
Do the best I could in that day.

120
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,790
I didn't have goals of like, as a young chef of owning a restaurant

121
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,529
or becoming the best in the world.

122
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,050
I wanted to compete every day amongst the team that I was in,

123
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,689
whether it was my guys working on the bench next to me or the opposition

124
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,569
that was thrown in front of me.

125
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,569
I just wanted to compete that day and win that day.

126
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,769
And then the next day I looked at the next day, like I didn't really aim too far ahead.

127
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,730
But once I started to get into a bigger market and started to have an opportunity

128
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,310
to open a restaurant, I went in not pretending to know anything.

129
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,709
Like I really did, I was a sponge and I still today try to think I'm a sponge.

130
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,930
And even though now I've got a few more scars and I know a little bit more,

131
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,329
I don't think to know it all, you know, and I'm always ready to learn.

132
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,670
So I think that's kind of been something I've, one of the reasons I've succeeded.

133
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,670
But also I don't stay within my own industry.

134
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,649
I think the problem within the hospitality industry and other industries

135
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,230
is it just become really insular.

136
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,990
You just stay in your industry and the people that are around you

137
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,129
facing the same issues become your community.

138
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:51,930
And that's a small pond attitude, you know, I want to live in the sea.

139
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,889
So I try to surround myself with people outside of my industry

140
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,829
to gain more knowledge, to learn what they've learned,

141
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,670
to see what they're facing, because then it can change my perception

142
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,230
and the way I approach business.

143
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,490
You're a great connector.

144
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,310
And I want to come back to that because, you know, when you catch up with you,

145
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,009
it's such an interesting experience because there's people from all walks of life

146
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,569
and you collect people, it seems, from sport, from, you know, industry.

147
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,269
And I mentioned about some of the brands that you've been an ambassador for.

148
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,269
I'll come back to that.

149
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,110
Because I think it's fascinating.

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,410
That's a real key, I think, to how you really do set yourself apart from others.

151
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,910
I look at you now, you start off in the kitchen.

152
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,529
You said you didn't have these huge goals, but it's turned up into a big empire.

153
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,470
You manage lots of people now.

154
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,449
How would you describe yourself as a leader?

155
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,069
I think I'm different in my two businesses.

156
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,029
You know, we talk a thing about the restaurant business.

157
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,589
I'm very connected to that business and I bleed for hospitality and I understand it.

158
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:52,649
And so in that type of business, I suppose, as a leader, I'm all in.

159
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:54,370
You know, I'm really all in.

160
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,569
I try not to lead.

161
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,269
In the earlier days, maybe through being a bit naive, I led through with a bit of intimidation.

162
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,370
And that comes from a low self-esteem, I think.

163
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,910
And that's become a negative now because I think that persona still lingers within, you know,

164
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,990
within, you know, the hospitality business.

165
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,170
I don't piss off Shane, you're going to get, well, that's not the way to lead.

166
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,910
You know, I try to use a lot more empathy now.

167
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,410
Try to deal with our people.

168
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,269
As people, as individuals, try to connect with them and just show some interest.

169
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,189
And I think that if you show interest in people, you show that you're actually invested in their

170
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:28,709
success and genuinely invested in their success, not just because you want something out of it,

171
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,470
people will go to war for you.

172
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,330
In my other business, in Provador, I'm learning how to be a leader in that business.

173
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,629
And I struggle with it every day.

174
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,610
And it's probably one of the things that really I'm battling with because it's a different type

175
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:40,929
of business.

176
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,929
It's different people.

177
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,850
I mean, you know, Darce, I mean, hospitality is about passion,

178
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,250
the high of being involved.

179
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,830
I'm involved in hospitality and it's addictive.

180
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,350
But in the different business like Provador, where I'm still unbelievably engaged in,

181
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,990
I'm dealing with a whole different demographic of people who don't respond in the same way

182
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,330
and it's challenging me.

183
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,950
So I'm still trying to work that one out.

184
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,769
Yeah, I'm interested in going there as well.

185
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,990
So many places to jump off with you, as you said, from the hospitality sector,

186
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:13,110
effectively to a food tech startup business, which is, we'll talk about that in a moment.

187
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,029
But I wanted to pick up on something you said because I love how open you are.

188
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,429
And any time I've been around you, that has been the case.

189
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,769
But talking about you as a young leader and maybe using some intimidation,

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,330
that's been a bit of the history of hospitality, hasn't it?

191
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,110
I mean, this shows Gordon Ramsay's got this reputation, whether that's true or not,

192
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,909
around the kitchen space being a pretty brutal environment where, you know,

193
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,830
young apprentices have been, you know, sort of targeted a little bit.

194
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,330
Hasn't always been a great part of the hospitality.

195
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,070
Do you reckon that was part of what you saw as a young chef coming through and maybe,

196
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,009
you know, learning that was what you felt?

197
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,769
You passed on and it's taken you a while to maybe find a different way?

198
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,250
Yeah, to be honest, it's probably one of the things that attracted me to the industry

199
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,330
because I knew that market.

200
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,570
Like, I know that that's the ring.

201
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,049
And I grew up in the ring.

202
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,330
You know, like we grew up in, like you said, in hard times in the Western suburbs.

203
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,009
And, you know, you either could battle with your intellect, which wasn't really well respected,

204
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,610
or you could battle with what you had.

205
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,269
And I was always a pretty bulky guy and I looked mean.

206
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:07,950
I wasn't really tough.

207
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,909
But I just, I knew how to fight in that ring.

208
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,950
And so when I saw that hospitality was competitive,

209
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:21,629
competitive and quite masculine, and, you know, your skills will take you a long way,

210
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,769
but you also had to have a persona of aggression to push your way through at those times.

211
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,850
It really did attract me to them.

212
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,250
But it's not, there's no longevity in that.

213
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,590
And it doesn't actually get you where you want to be.

214
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,929
You just end up an old grumpy man that nobody respects and nobody loves and nobody actually

215
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:42,750
cares about.

216
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,149
And it's a quick road to the end.

217
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,870
So I had to leave that behind.

218
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,730
But I love your evolution, Shane, because some people can never change that.

219
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,470
It's hard to shift paradigms as a person when that's all you've known.

220
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:53,990
In fact, most people can never do that.

221
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,830
So for you to understand that, you know, and we talk about this a lot, Shane.

222
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,029
In fact, this whole podcast is based on exactly that, this new generation of leadership, which

223
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,610
is more self-reflective and more collaborative.

224
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,169
And you've found that shift.

225
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,029
Was there someone that really inspired you?

226
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,169
Or was it just that you came to that realization yourself?

227
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,950
You know, I think there's a lot of people.

228
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,129
There's a lot of people that helped me get through that.

229
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,169
But I think the biggest thing that I learned was just through some personal issues that

230
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:20,490
I had.

231
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,169
You know, from the outside, you can look at everything and go, wow, he's got a great life.

232
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:24,610
It looks good.

233
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,389
Instagram looks good.

234
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:26,750
Nice cars, pretty wife.

235
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,350
Kids are good.

236
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,950
You know, good football team.

237
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,429
But the reality is that everyone goes through a ton of battles in the dark, you know, and

238
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,169
personal issues, self-esteem issues, relationship issues.

239
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,549
And that's the real core of someone.

240
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,950
It's not what's on the outside.

241
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,929
It's what's happening.

242
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,110
It's what's happening at home, behind the scenes.

243
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,470
Forget about the leadership and the business stuff.

244
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,629
If you can't fix yourself, you're never going to be a good leader because you're just, you're

245
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,470
talking shit, you know, because you don't actually know how to fix yourself.

246
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,370
How are you going to fix somebody else?

247
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,870
And essentially, as a leader, you're fixing people and you're helping them, right?

248
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,549
So I was lucky.

249
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,830
First, I suppose I was lucky the person that helped me the most was my wife.

250
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,870
Because if I was her, I probably would have walked away a long time ago.

251
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,230
And she didn't.

252
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,570
You know, she stuck beside me, invested in our family, invested in our values.

253
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,929
And really, probably the biggest thing that I learned from her was that she was a great

254
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:17,529
The easier thing for her would have been to say, you're too hard, I'm out.

255
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:23,409
So her and I resolving our issues, resolving, you know, helping me get strong again.

256
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,289
And then me knowing, again, falling in that position that I suppose I felt with my father

257
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,470
and everybody else, I can't let this person down now.

258
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,590
You know, I actually have to, she invested so much in me, I have to get better.

259
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,210
So I changed my mentality.

260
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,490
I started training better.

261
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,769
I started eating better, surrounding myself with more positive people, shed a couple of

262
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,629
the bit of the dead weight that was holding me back.

263
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,909
And being honest.

264
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,149
And being honest enough to reflect and seek help.

265
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,789
You know, I spoke to psychologists.

266
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,990
I spoke to someone to help me sort of meditate and try to center myself and understand why

267
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,950
are you being like this?

268
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,970
You know, and not just flipping the script and becoming Gandhi overnight.

269
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,830
But just, you know, because you don't have to be, you know, suddenly I'm, you know, drinking

270
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,470
my coffee out of Keep Cups and, you know, driving an electric car.

271
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,090
But just understanding why do you do this stuff?

272
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,750
And if you want to decide to keep going that track, fine.

273
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,389
Own it.

274
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,370
There's nothing wrong with that.

275
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:15,970
That's who you want to be.

276
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:16,289
Be it.

277
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,169
But I don't want to be that person.

278
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,110
I love how brutally honest you are, mate.

279
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,990
And, you know, your beautiful wife, Maha.

280
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,409
Maha is the name of your wife and your businesses.

281
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,309
And obviously, you know, your dedication to understand.

282
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,710
And let's be honest, you draw back the curtain for everyone.

283
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,049
Below it, we've all got the same challenges.

284
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,169
Everyone faces them.

285
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,590
Some people just can never get a handle on it or really understand themselves well enough

286
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,889
to say, actually, I do want to live a better life than that.

287
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,370
And, you know, for you to go and find that way is a great credit.

288
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,490
It must be, as you said, everyone's a work in progress.

289
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,409
But it feels like you've come a long way down that path.

290
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,889
Yeah.

291
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,690
Yeah.

292
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,850
And I'm not good, you know, but I'm trying.

293
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,649
And I actually understand when I fall off and when I mess up, why,

294
00:13:58,769 --> 00:13:59,710
and then how to resolve it.

295
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,169
And I think that you can't just sweep it under the carpet, address things,

296
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,090
call it out, fix it, move on.

297
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,250
You know, but my strength has always been my community, mate.

298
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:14,309
Like, I've got great friends that I can call on, whether it's I need advice,

299
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:14,350
you know, I need help.

300
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,509
And someone to pull me in line.

301
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,129
Or if it's just someone to just to blow some steam off with.

302
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,570
I know that I've got really good people from a good cross-section who are invested in me

303
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,450
and my happiness.

304
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:24,450
So that's it.

305
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:34,590
I want to go back to and head towards Provador and what you've created, mate,

306
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,850
because it is one of the great success stories in recent times.

307
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,409
But firstly, can I just go back to you're running your business successfully.

308
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,009
Suddenly COVID hits.

309
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,389
Melbourne holds the record for the longest lockdown city in the world by the end of that period.

310
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,330
How stressful did that get when you couldn't,

311
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,570
when you couldn't literally open the doors?

312
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:52,110
Yeah.

313
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,370
The stress, the stress wasn't because I couldn't open the doors.

314
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,850
The stress was from the pressure that I put on myself to find a way.

315
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,809
And I felt immense pressure, you know, immense pressure to find a way out of this.

316
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,610
Like it wasn't, oh my God, my life's turned to shit.

317
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,970
I never really came to that point or maybe briefly in the beginning.

318
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,769
But as soon as I'm pushed past that, I went, well, you can't just dwell on it.

319
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:16,529
You have to find a way.

320
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,789
That pressure was huge.

321
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:19,950
And it almost broke me.

322
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:20,289
I remember.

323
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,769
I remember when just before we launched Provador, um, I mean like hours before we launched

324
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,409
Provador, cause it was so many moving parts to get it ready on time.

325
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:31,149
I mean, we took a six month launch strategy and compressed into like six weeks.

326
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,690
Um, like it almost broke me.

327
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,929
Like I, the day we went live, I remember sitting in our little private room at the front of

328
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,990
Maha and it was like an out of body experience.

329
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,190
I remember sitting myself, sitting down in that room with the small team that we had

330
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,509
and we were, they were all sort of celebrating that it's actually live.

331
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,169
And I can just remember myself standing up, walking up.

332
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,990
I should have probably, shouldn't have probably drove home.

333
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,250
But the next thing I remember was walking up, waking up in bed at home, like a day later.

334
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,009
And Maha was saying to me that I walked inside, opened the door and like collapsed on the

335
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:00,409
stairs.

336
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,210
I just, it like broke me, but I had to push myself that hard to know that I could, cause

337
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,090
it was a big deal, mate.

338
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,049
This was something that could actually destroy everything I built.

339
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,389
Um, so I had to find a way, but it's, um, it was pretty scary.

340
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,730
I mentioned grit and that's a great example.

341
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,450
I mean, a lot of people went to online who'd never thought about doing food delivery in

342
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,110
the past in restaurants.

343
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,210
Yeah.

344
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:26,350
But for you to take it to that next level and essentially create a platform for, for

345
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,970
all these iconic businesses and, and that's what Provador is in the middle of the most

346
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,429
stressful time is such a unique, you know, and not only that, it was the, the execution

347
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,750
and the speed with which you did it with.

348
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,830
And then I suppose Shane, you know, in the hospitality sector, you've got enormous amounts

349
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,809
of friends, but everyone's competitive as well.

350
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:49,110
So you had to get the trust of these iconic restaurants to say, I can handle this part

351
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,649
for you.

352
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:50,649
How was that?

353
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,409
And, and what were those conversations like?

354
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:59,850
Um, surprisingly that part was, wasn't the hardest part, um, friendship is important.

355
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,130
And obviously in a, in a normal world, it would be increasingly hard to get restaurants

356
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,130
to come on and do that.

357
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,150
And we're finding that now, I mean, Provador is still, you know, it's a, still a successful

358
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,150
business and, and growing, just invested a lot of money, raise some capital.

359
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,390
Um, and we're, and we're finding that those conversations harder now when you're moving

360
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,390
to new markets.

361
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,470
We're in Sydney, we're in Brisbane, we're going to launch in Perth, Perth and Adelaide.

362
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,069
By the end of the year, um, but I think that I was really genuine.

363
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,509
I just approached the conversations.

364
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,430
I spoke to like Andrew McConnell, you know, you know, he has restaurants, he's a great

365
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,970
Melbourne entity, um, identity.

366
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,470
Um, and I just spoke to him via zoom and said, Andy, I'll, I will be the custodian of your

367
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,470
brand.

368
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,910
Like I'm putting my brands on this thing.

369
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,950
I will look after your brand.

370
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,890
I won't put it in any danger.

371
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,890
You have to trust me.

372
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,890
Yeah.

373
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,470
You know, and, and I do that with like most of our guys, like I'll sit down and I'm honest

374
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
with that.

375
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,769
I do not want to jeopardize I'm, I'm their brand.

376
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:56,470
I'm firmly invested in the industry and I don't look at this as a, as a short stop,

377
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,950
you know, and I did in the beginning, I thought this is just something to help us get us through.

378
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,549
But the more I time I spent in Provido, I realized that this is the way for us to break

379
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,750
out of this prison that we have and, and, and, and finally find a way to make this into a

380
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
real business.

381
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,710
So this is what I love about this Shane, because you know, you, you walk into Maha, such a

382
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,029
brilliant restaurant, iconic restaurant, but there's millions of dollars worth of fit out

383
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,470
that goes into dragging people into the city.

384
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,430
It's so easy in Melbourne to come in and have that experience.

385
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,710
And so there's always been this mindset, I can't just give the Maha experience to people

386
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,750
who take away at home or, you know, you think of the flower drum who were using Provido

387
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,630
or these incredible restaurants that have got these great brands.

388
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,650
So the, the shift is to sort of say, Hey, only, you know, a hundred people can, you

389
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,410
know, however many it is in Maha at one period of time, but at the same time we can fill

390
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,349
that up several times over.

391
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:47,769
Is that the shift in mentality that Provido is providing for the hospitality industry?

392
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:48,769
Yeah.

393
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,730
That's the fundamental revenue part, which is I think important.

394
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,250
And that's the thing that everybody looks at the end of the day, how much money does

395
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,250
it make me?

396
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,890
But how do you measure how much money it makes you?

397
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,529
I said, it's about new eyeballs and hospitality is really hard to market a hospitality business.

398
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,650
There's so many, so many great restaurants, only so many customers, how do you get their

399
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,650
attention?

400
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,910
Um, so really now what Provido has developed to is where we're a strategic marketing partner

401
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,910
for our restaurants.

402
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,650
Um, it's how do we not just drive sales online?

403
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,730
I want to make sure we can drive bums on seats.

404
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,730
Yeah.

405
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,250
We want to get new customers into those restaurants, you know, 70% of customers that come to the

406
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,410
platform experience a restaurant for the first time through the platform.

407
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,829
So that's a lot of customers.

408
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:31,970
So the proposition I go to the restaurants is great, look, we can provide you with revenue

409
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,670
and there'll be some revenue and there'll be probably significant revenue, but look

410
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,190
at how many new customers across the state we're going to put you in front of, you know,

411
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,210
and we can share that data with you and we can help drive revenue into your restaurants

412
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,690
and we can grow your market, um, and evolve your, your, your market.

413
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,690
So it's not just, you know, your traditional restaurant customer you have.

414
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,190
Look at how many new demographics we can bring you.

415
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,190
And that's the exciting bit.

416
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,190
Yeah.

417
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,069
And maybe the next generation as well, where you maybe wouldn't have been able to take

418
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,670
the whole family into Maha or one of those restaurants, but now you can have a little

419
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,789
sample of that at home and then, and then the ambition to go, I'll go back to the leadership

420
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,650
part because as you said, the hospitality world is you and you know how to connect in

421
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,650
that space.

422
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,650
Now you're building an online tech platform.

423
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,650
You're into a different, different sphere.

424
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,210
And you said it's a, it's a work in progress as a leader in that space.

425
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,690
What, what have been some of the challenges?

426
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,690
Uh, fighting.

427
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,690
Fighting my place.

428
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,309
Um, I'm, I don't know at all, you know, I don't know it all in hospitality.

429
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,930
I definitely don't know it all in e-commerce.

430
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,690
Um, I've employed, well, I've employed a partner with a great CEO, um, who's comes from eBay.

431
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,410
He's got a ton of experience, 10 years plus in there.

432
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,009
And we're building a new team, a new structure that I don't understand.

433
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:42,009
I know in a restaurant with a front of house, back of house, we've got the head office team.

434
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,009
I know how to manage that.

435
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,069
Um, but this is a totally new team.

436
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,190
You know, we've got developers, we've got marketers, all flavors of marketers, you

437
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,990
know, flavors, you know, people that I didn't even know, retention marketer, frequency marketers,

438
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,569
acquisition marketers, conversion marketers, and, and, and, and, and people with different

439
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:03,809
experiences, um, different way of doing business, a different, a different upbringing, um, culturally

440
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,910
different, you know, values different and, and, and, and, and spread across the country,

441
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,190
um, where we're doing, you know, two days in the office, if maybe two days in the office,

442
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,190
uh, most of your meetings are done online.

443
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,809
How do you build that connectivity, that trust, that loyalty?

444
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,829
Um, how do you even gauge who, who's doing what, when, you know, it's always in the restaurant,

445
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,710
you can see who's chopping the veg and like, I don't know who's working and what they're

446
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,809
actually getting done, but also I suppose not running, not being the main guy, you know,

447
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,190
like, um, at, at, in the restaurants, even though we've got leaders in every department,

448
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,910
um, I'm still the main guy, um, in Provador, yeah, I'm still the main guy, but really Tim's

449
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,430
the CEO and he runs it.

450
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,970
So working out how we work together, um, and also trying to balance out my time, mate,

451
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,650
because both businesses are really, really busy.

452
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,650
Yeah.

453
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,690
I want to stay true to my other values and, and make sure I'm looking after myself and

454
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,049
looking after the family and then doing the media stuff as well.

455
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,589
So, um, I'm learning and I haven't got it right and, and it's, it's the thing I'm struggling

456
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:03,190
with the most is how do I get more out of myself to contribute more into that business

457
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,430
because it needs me the most.

458
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,150
With the, with the sense of values and family balance as well, which everyone is striving,

459
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,150
uh, Shane, and you, you have an incredible capacity, but I love that your values are

460
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,150
right out in front.

461
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,650
We can come back to the connection, uh, piece because I said, I mean, you are a, a, a, a,

462
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,890
a great connector of people.

463
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,529
I've had the privilege of occasionally dropping into your world and it's a lot of fun.

464
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,190
There's an annual dinner that you hold, uh, that is great fun and you look around the

465
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,849
room and there's, there's a young boxer that you've supported.

466
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,150
There's the head of Mercedes who's a great friend.

467
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,150
You bring people together.

468
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,210
I mean, that in itself is a great story.

469
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,450
You're, you're ambassador for the Bulldogs, a great supporter of the club that we both,

470
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,849
both love, but you're also, you're a great connector that brought Mercedes Benz to the

471
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:44,849
Western Bulldogs.

472
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,529
No one would have thought that was a partner.

473
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:46,650
Yeah.

474
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,109
A partnership that was even possible, but that, that to me is, is Shane Delia and, and

475
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,869
is that always been the way as a, as a kid, were you a connector of people or is that

476
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:55,869
something that you've developed?

477
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,410
No, definitely wasn't as a kid.

478
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,289
Um, very, I had a very small, I hate the word network cause it's so transactional, like

479
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,730
a very small community of people as a kid.

480
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,650
And I thought everybody in Australia was Maltese until I left foreign school.

481
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,650
You know, I lived in Deer Park.

482
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,529
But it's, um, it really didn't, to be honest, I didn't really understand the power of a

483
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,529
community.

484
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,369
And the value, not, and I think sometimes when you talk about power, it's about the,

485
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,609
you know, the, the value to yourself and how much you can get out of it.

486
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,609
There's so much more.

487
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:29,349
I, I didn't realize the value of a good community until probably about three or four years into

488
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:33,289
owning my own business when I started to see different people in my venue.

489
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:37,650
Um, I mean, the first time I went past, the first time I went out to Kew was when we bought

490
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,650
a restaurant out there.

491
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,650
I didn't even know that side of town was, was, was around like, so it's, um, it, it

492
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,410
is, it is a, it is something that I really value.

493
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,410
And it's my strength.

494
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,410
Um, but I, as a kid, I wasn't, I wasn't great at it.

495
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,410
I've had, I've had to develop it.

496
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,250
Um, and now I've got great friends and I take, you know, I don't look, I don't seek them

497
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,089
out based on their title or based on who they are.

498
00:23:58,089 --> 00:23:59,089
We're just drawn to each other.

499
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:04,210
Um, I've been asked a ton of times to join networking communities and, um, we won't single

500
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,650
any one of them out, but I don't, I don't know.

501
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,789
I haven't, I haven't needed to, I've, I've finally just met people along the way and

502
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,789
it just happens.

503
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:11,789
And.

504
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:12,789
Yeah, it's a great gift.

505
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,410
I mean, last time I, I did catch up with you at Maha.

506
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,410
Um.

507
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,410
I don't know what experience that was with another interesting group of people, but we're

508
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,329
talking about part of what we've through the leadership space is actually connecting different

509
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,910
people, but on the same values you're talking about, not about how do we grow our commerce

510
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,650
to that might be a byproduct of what happens of it, but how do you get diverse people together

511
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,730
just because you share the same values you want to learn, you want to grow and you want

512
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,730
to learn.

513
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,910
And that's, that's part of what we've been doing through our work at Alita.

514
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,829
And I love the fact that that's something that's been created just by youth organically

515
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:45,829
in it.

516
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:50,150
I said, based on values, not just, can I get the next most influential person in my life?

517
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,069
Because being around you, that's, that's just not the case.

518
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:53,069
Yeah.

519
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:56,089
I think that I've, I've tried to invest in people for people as that, who they are and

520
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,089
what they need.

521
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,990
And sometimes they just need somebody that's just down to earth that's not going to try

522
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,990
to get something out of them.

523
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,990
Yeah.

524
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,990
Like I don't try to get things out of people.

525
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,990
Don't be wrong.

526
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,990
If I need something, I'll ask.

527
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,990
Yeah.

528
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,990
A hundred percent I'll ask.

529
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,990
And I expect the same in return.

530
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,990
And I, and I'll always deliver.

531
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,329
Like if someone asks me for something, I don't deliver expecting to receive something back

532
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:14,329
later.

533
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:15,329
I'll just deliver.

534
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:16,970
I can get them where they need to be.

535
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,650
Um, and generally that's enough.

536
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,950
You know, like if it's, if, if you ever, if, if, if, if their favor ever comes back, great.

537
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,069
If it doesn't and you achieved your goal, amazing.

538
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,069
That's all I want to do.

539
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,950
And I'm lucky to be surrounded by people who've got the same values and you know, you can

540
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,829
have transactional relationships too, then it's not a bad thing.

541
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:37,670
Um, but once you've brought people into Enid Sanctum, I feel that they're there for life

542
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,690
and um, true testament of that was the speed we got Provador together.

543
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,450
I mean, that was our Bulldogs community, you know, Jason White and Sam Salter, the guys

544
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,329
that are marketplacer.

545
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,769
They turned that around for me in a second and I met those guys through the club.

546
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:54,130
They, uh, they created bike exchange initially, another brilliant, brilliant story and, and

547
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,369
that, that was the community and they were the ones that had the tech skills to support

548
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:58,369
you with Provador.

549
00:25:58,369 --> 00:25:59,369
Yeah.

550
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:00,369
And I met them through the club.

551
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,369
Yeah.

552
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:02,369
Um, Chris Nolan, you know, sits on our border.

553
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,589
You know, you know, he helped me with all of our marketing and, and our procurement

554
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,589
of media.

555
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:10,009
Um, you know, Peter Gordon and Lev Shevky, you know, from Gordon's and, and Cornwall's

556
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:12,329
that, you know, those guys turned around in a second and helped me.

557
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:13,329
Yeah.

558
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:14,329
And it really was our, our Bulldogs community.

559
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,329
Yeah.

560
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:19,329
And I'm not just doing that to say, you know, Bulldogs to me, it was a community that just

561
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:22,670
went, I'm putting down everything, this bloke needs us right now, let's just jump in and

562
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,670
do it.

563
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,670
And that's, that, that's, that's your strength.

564
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,670
Yeah.

565
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,390
It's not about money in the bank or maybe name out in lights.

566
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,109
It's what people will lay down to get you where you need to be and everybody was there

567
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:33,109
for me.

568
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:34,109
Yeah.

569
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,990
And I love that, you know, authentically, you, you as a person have always been there

570
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,109
for other, but without expecting that in return, I think it's a great lesson out of this conversation

571
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:45,329
with you is that when that happens naturally, you don't expect something, but it comes back.

572
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,329
Yeah.

573
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:47,329
Always with that, with more interest.

574
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:51,329
Now before, there's a range of leadership questions I want to ask you Shane, but I can't

575
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:55,150
help, uh, sitting alongside somebody who loves food all their life and, and you can see it

576
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,910
when you're around you, what, what's been, what have been some of the great food experiences

577
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,170
of your life or some of the great meals or where, where, where do you go?

578
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,170
It's probably a hard question to ask.

579
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,170
Oh, no, not really.

580
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,170
Um, there's been tons and I, and I like simple stuff, mate.

581
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,670
Like I, I could, I could talk about the top end and I could talk about chicken nuggets,

582
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,670
mate.

583
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,670
Cause I like, I'm, I'm a big fan of chicken nuggets.

584
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,170
Yeah.

585
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:21,630
Um, but look, I've, I've, oh, geez, um, uh, a little, a little restaurant, um, a little

586
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,210
restaurant in, in Paris.

587
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,769
Um, and I know it sounds really extravagant, but we'll start from the top end, a two Michelin

588
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:32,569
star restaurant, um, that a friend of mine told me about, never heard much about it.

589
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:35,549
My, my heart and I were in there at the year of the world cup.

590
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:40,410
So 2018, I think, um, we'd left my family in Malta with my mom and dad.

591
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,690
So it was just her and I, no kids.

592
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,690
And we belted in and we sat in this restaurant.

593
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,750
And I was blown away just with the bread that came out and then, of course, you were

594
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,650
in for a good feed here.

595
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,809
Um, and that, that was like a, a really, really, really good experience.

596
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:58,009
I mean, um, so what makes that is, what's the secret is people walk into a restaurant

597
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,009
and there is a feel about it that, that changes your whole experience.

598
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:08,309
I think in that scenario, you walk in and I, I, I'm, I'm a lover of hospitality.

599
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:08,690
All right.

600
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,410
So, and, and I, I can't help it, but I just automatically go into this like terminator

601
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,549
scanning mode of a restaurant.

602
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:17,710
When I walk in, I can see every floor, everything and it's okay.

603
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,910
I can accept them, but I'm just trying to get a lay of the land, but I walked into this

604
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,730
venue and I've just gone like, I've scanned the rooms, got, oh shit, we're in, we're,

605
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:26,329
this is serious.

606
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,210
You know, the way that the waiter walked in the, the attitude of the, you know, of their,

607
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,930
you know, their persona was amazing.

608
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,950
The way they were dressed, the, the way they connected, you know, the kitchen was like

609
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,950
in unisync and no noise.

610
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:38,970
No, it was just getting done.

611
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,670
You're like, wow.

612
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,190
You look at the architecture, you look at the roof, you look at the table, you sit down

613
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,369
there.

614
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,529
It just feels right.

615
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,630
The table feels right.

616
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,269
The cutlery weight is right.

617
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,170
It's just like, you're going, wow, this is really good.

618
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,329
You look around the rest of the dining room and you can see the ways the waiters are interacting

619
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:52,849
with tables.

620
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:56,430
It's just everything had been thought through and it was an art.

621
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:02,930
And then when you get the plate and it looks like a work of art and it tastes exceptional,

622
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,049
you're like, oh my God, you're blown away.

623
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,250
Like this is just, the price people always thought, oh, but it would have been expensive.

624
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,190
It gives a shit.

625
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:12,049
Like, honestly, like it is, who cares?

626
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:13,789
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

627
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,049
And it doesn't even matter what it costs.

628
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:17,670
And I was blown away.

629
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,869
But then I've had great meals, like in a shelled out building in Tripoli, sitting in an alley

630
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,589
eating hummus on a milk crate.

631
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,950
It's the same experience, exactly the same experience.

632
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:33,670
You look around, the environment, really authentic, thousands of years.

633
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:36,609
You look around and you immerse yourself in the environment.

634
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,210
You think about the happiness, the pain, the sorrow that's happened just here.

635
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,589
The people that have come through, the love that's in that.

636
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,130
One dish and how many stories have connected through that one dish.

637
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,809
And you just immerse yourself in that environment.

638
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:51,710
And that's the value.

639
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,009
You know, like that meal cost a dollar.

640
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,390
The other one cost a couple grand.

641
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:55,690
Yeah.

642
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:56,849
But the value was the same.

643
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,390
The value is totally the same.

644
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:05,309
You're taking me back to as a son of a Republican and growing up in the pub space and going out with my dad always.

645
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:06,569
It's exactly you.

646
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,829
It's the side scandal.

647
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,529
Is the music up too loud?

648
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,890
Is the waiter paying attention?

649
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,470
The guy who poured the beer, how much did he waste?

650
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:13,569
I don't know.

651
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:18,029
You know, that's straight to the bottom, straight to the bottom line.

652
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,289
I love hearing those experiences.

653
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:23,470
You just hear passion come through when you talk about food.

654
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,390
Hey, Shane, we're talking to leaders from a vast array of backgrounds in different areas,

655
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,390
but we're identifying what we think are these common traits around leadership.

656
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:35,450
And it comes through in your language big time.

657
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,470
Self-leadership, I've heard you talk about it already,

658
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,430
but we see that as almost being the first quality of a leader.

659
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,769
What does that mean to you?

660
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,549
For me,

661
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:47,589
it means doing the most I can out of each day.

662
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,869
I think to be a leader who sits there and says,

663
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,190
oh, you know, not I want more, but we need to do more.

664
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,329
We need to do this.

665
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,150
We need to do that.

666
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,269
And then you sit on your ass and you're just getting through the day.

667
00:30:58,809 --> 00:30:59,569
That's not a leader.

668
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,650
I don't think you have to belt yourself and push yourself against the wall.

669
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,009
You have to achieve something.

670
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:09,730
But I know every night when I put my head on my bed,

671
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:10,410
like hand on my heart,

672
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,990
I know that I might not be the best,

673
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,430
might not got the most done,

674
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,470
but I have given my all that day.

675
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,869
And if I wasn't enough,

676
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,029
it's because I wasn't good enough.

677
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:20,690
And that's fine.

678
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,210
It wasn't because I didn't try hard enough.

679
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,289
I gave my all.

680
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:24,890
Whether it's conversations I've had,

681
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,349
you know,

682
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,349
the way I engage with someone

683
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,130
or the opportunity I've given to somebody else

684
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,650
or the time that I've taken out

685
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,069
just to walk around the city and look up,

686
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,049
it's the most I could do.

687
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,529
And I'm content with that.

688
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,410
So being a leader who leads by example.

689
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,769
Yeah.

690
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:39,630
And you spoke about,

691
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,029
you know,

692
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,049
your change in diet,

693
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,230
your access to improving yourself,

694
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,190
was a person as well,

695
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,349
really resonated for me.

696
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:45,650
Starting,

697
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,329
I think you used the term at the start of this podcast,

698
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:47,710
you know,

699
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,650
if I can't lead myself,

700
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,990
then how am I going to lead a big team,

701
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:52,670
which you clearly do with great skill.

702
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,829
We see leaders are really conscious now,

703
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:55,269
Shane,

704
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,490
of how they positively impact others in the environment.

705
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,369
You've mentioned this already,

706
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,910
you know,

707
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,329
from you maybe being an intimidating leader

708
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:04,009
to really being a more caring and empathetic leader.

709
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,210
Have you consciously thought about that

710
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,150
and the impact you have on others?

711
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:07,730
Yeah.

712
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:08,650
Yeah,

713
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,329
I definitely have.

714
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,130
And it's hard

715
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,690
because your body language says a lot,

716
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,910
right?

717
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,210
And especially when people,

718
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,890
people perceive you being a certain way.

719
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,829
So say you're in a meeting

720
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:19,650
and something's not going the way you want it to go.

721
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,549
And people,

722
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,029
whether they want,

723
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:21,650
they start like,

724
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,089
their eyes start shifting towards you

725
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,069
to see how you're reacting.

726
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:24,529
Now,

727
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,029
if you react in a way that they expect,

728
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:26,650
the whole room,

729
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:27,630
your energy changes,

730
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:28,509
you know,

731
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,849
and to sort of hold yourself back

732
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,029
and try to not have that face that they want you to see,

733
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:33,670
that's even worse.

734
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,269
You have to honestly let go,

735
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:35,609
like,

736
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,269
and not be that

737
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,369
and find a new way to connect.

738
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:41,029
And I think something that I've struggled with in the past

739
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,690
in confronting situations

740
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,549
where people are getting a reaction that they expect

741
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:46,789
is that I don't listen.

742
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:47,930
You know,

743
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:48,950
I'll just react.

744
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:49,569
I'll just talk.

745
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:50,089
And then,

746
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,869
just to say to listen more

747
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,190
and to listen more.

748
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,589
And you may have something you want to say,

749
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,109
but actually listen to what's actually happening.

750
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,390
Take it in,

751
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:58,269
digest it.

752
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,210
And you don't even have to give your opinion then and there.

753
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,630
I think that the best thing you can do is take time,

754
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:03,509
you know,

755
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:04,190
suck it in.

756
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,490
Yeah,

757
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,630
look,

758
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,890
and admit when you don't have the answer.

759
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:08,450
And sometimes buy yourself some time,

760
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:09,430
come back and address it later.

761
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:09,710
Yeah.

762
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,769
It actually has more impact than just losing your shit.

763
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,150
Yeah.

764
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:12,569
Or,

765
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,950
talking for the sake of talking.

766
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,289
Yeah.

767
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,390
To look like you've got an answer.

768
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:15,589
Yeah,

769
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,750
it's a great lesson.

770
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,309
We see leaders have got a really interesting process

771
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:22,109
around how they create and share their vision.

772
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,269
The vision for Provador is an enormous,

773
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,630
as I described it in the opener,

774
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,049
is a game changer for the industry.

775
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,170
And it has the potential and it has already done that.

776
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:30,789
I mean,

777
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,849
how have you gone about creating and sharing the vision

778
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,089
in the world that you create?

779
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,230
With Provador,

780
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,029
is he talking about me specifically?

781
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:40,390
Yeah,

782
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,230
just your world and how you go.

783
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:42,450
I mean,

784
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,990
Maha's a vision that you've created.

785
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,329
I mean,

786
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:47,190
is there a system that you've put behind that?

787
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,509
Or is it just you and-

788
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:55,940
I think that I'm quite reactive.

789
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,140
So if I've got something I'm passionate about,

790
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,880
I have to talk about it.

791
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,339
You know,

792
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,539
because I can't just internalize it and start to work it out

793
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,839
and come with a finished vision of where we're going.

794
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm not that guy.

795
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,740
I have to talk about it.

796
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,639
I have to talk about it a lot.

797
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,280
Talk about it a lot with different people.

798
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,679
And during that time,

799
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,199
I'm sitting there,

800
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:13,380
I'm digesting it,

801
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,139
I'm processing it,

802
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm building it.

803
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,980
And it'll change a million times,

804
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:17,199
right?

805
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,300
Whether it's the Provador story or a restaurant story,

806
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,480
or,

807
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:19,820
you know,

808
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,679
I spoke to you before about,

809
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,719
we're about to open a little cocktail lounge.

810
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:23,940
Like,

811
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,699
I've been talking about that for a while

812
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,519
and trying to understand it.

813
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,599
And once I visualize it,

814
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,619
then I need to get everyone on the journey with me.

815
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:29,840
Yeah.

816
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm like,

817
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,599
all right,

818
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,099
this is where I think we should go.

819
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,380
Present it.

820
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:34,599
Are we in?

821
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,019
Let people pick at it.

822
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,099
Because then you can learn some stuff.

823
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,119
Make sure everyone's aligned.

824
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,500
And let's go together.

825
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,780
Because then when we're all on the same boat,

826
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,239
we're going,

827
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,780
we're going.

828
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,639
And that's exciting.

829
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,019
Yeah.

830
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,280
You know,

831
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,960
it's really exciting.

832
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,900
We've done a great job of explaining that,

833
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,119
your process,

834
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,420
you know,

835
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,739
exactly how it is.

836
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,099
And I suppose Provador,

837
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,960
then I'm interested to delve into that a little bit more

838
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,659
because everyone through that period of time,

839
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,239
the restaurant industry was facing extreme stress.

840
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,920
But then I'm assuming there's some risk attached.

841
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,539
You've got to build some software.

842
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,699
You've got to employ some people.

843
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,480
I mean,

844
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,380
how about,

845
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,400
how about that one?

846
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,739
Was that,

847
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,199
as you said,

848
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,440
I suppose you collapsed afterwards,

849
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,400
but did you take your,

850
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,199
you know,

851
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,000
more time than you thought to get that,

852
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,420
to go on?

853
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,980
It's getting harder now.

854
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:16,960
Now we're in the fight.

855
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:17,380
All right.

856
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,519
Like,

857
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,400
so Provador in the beginning,

858
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,239
there was no other real choice.

859
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:20,739
We had,

860
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,019
we,

861
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,320
we did the best we could and we built a,

862
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
a marketplace that worked,

863
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,739
not the best marketplace to work,

864
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,539
but it worked.

865
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,139
And,

866
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,139
but now it,

867
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,420
you know,

868
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,820
the market's equalizing a little bit.

869
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,760
People have got choice again.

870
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,500
They can go in restaurant,

871
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,539
then go out and getting the attention of our restaurant partners is,

872
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:35,820
is,

873
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,119
is,

874
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:36,360
is,

875
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,000
is a challenge because you go back to what you know,

876
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,539
right?

877
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,340
You go back to what you know,

878
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,500
you do your traditional thing.

879
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,639
You can,

880
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,760
you can use a heap of analogies,

881
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:45,960
right?

882
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,519
If you kick the ball wrong forever,

883
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,239
you kick the ball wrong,

884
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,300
unless you actually straightened up,

885
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,739
you always go back to sort of what you know.

886
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,360
It takes a long time to correct that.

887
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,519
And restaurants going back to what they know and not,

888
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,539
not believing in the future.

889
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,900
Now that we're back open and people forget,

890
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,300
don't they?

891
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:00,719
Yeah.

892
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,099
But we're taking a lot of risk.

893
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,659
Like,

894
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,139
you know,

895
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:03,380
we've,

896
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,699
like I said,

897
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,699
we've raised a heap of money.

898
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,679
We're building new tech.

899
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,460
We've employed a bucket load of people,

900
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,739
building a brand,

901
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,760
spending on ads.

902
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,960
Because I really do believe,

903
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,179
not in myself and,

904
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:13,619
and,

905
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,840
and this is going to make me a buck.

906
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:15,579
Cause believe me,

907
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,780
it's not making a buck at the moment.

908
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,159
But this is the way of the future for restaurants.

909
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,760
I don't want to move restaurants online.

910
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:23,219
No.

911
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,280
Restaurants need to be,

912
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,880
we need to be there gritty,

913
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:26,780
you know,

914
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,400
in the restaurant,

915
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:28,380
building relationships,

916
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,500
creating experiences.

917
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,000
But this is definitely the way for us to have,

918
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:32,480
you know,

919
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,920
two markets to connect to more people.

920
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,340
And there's a ton of risk and a,

921
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,460
and a ton of work in connecting with our restaurant partners.

922
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,639
And,

923
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,539
and that's,

924
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,699
that's the big challenge at the moment.

925
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:41,980
It's,

926
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,039
it's show,

927
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,599
opening the,

928
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,159
some get it straight away.

929
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:45,920
They're like,

930
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,119
yeah,

931
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:46,840
we see this.

932
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,500
It's definitely not even about the revenue.

933
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:48,920
It's about,

934
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:49,780
this is the future.

935
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,699
Because,

936
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,079
you know,

937
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:51,800
think about my kids,

938
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,199
your kids,

939
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,519
they live on their phone now.

940
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:53,780
Yeah.

941
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,840
They consume on their phone.

942
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,059
They,

943
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,199
they get their information.

944
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,800
They buy,

945
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,300
they live,

946
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,539
they communicate through their phone.

947
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:58,800
Yeah.

948
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,260
The person in the future is going to buy your restaurant through their phone.

949
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,559
Yeah.

950
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:02,980
So,

951
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,599
you know.

952
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,019
If you're not there,

953
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,980
then you're going to miss out on that generation of,

954
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:06,619
have to be there.

955
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:06,820
Yeah.

956
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,159
It makes,

957
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:07,739
it makes sense.

958
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:08,239
We,

959
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,599
we see leaders,

960
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,019
Shane,

961
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,599
curiosity is a common word that comes up.

962
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,219
Just these days.

963
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:18,380
And often they approach their learning and their improvement through the lens of curiosity.

964
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,679
Does,

965
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,639
does that resonate with you?

966
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,119
Yeah,

967
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:20,519
it does.

968
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,260
And it's probably one of my,

969
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,659
my,

970
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,480
my flaws.

971
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,320
I don't feel like,

972
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,260
I feel like better myself in so many verticals,

973
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,420
right?

974
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:27,699
Like,

975
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,760
like you said,

976
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:28,960
you know,

977
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,360
personally,

978
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:29,900
professionally,

979
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,360
mentally,

980
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:30,840
physically,

981
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,000
where I don't grow myself enough is,

982
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,079
is,

983
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,099
is probably knowledge.

984
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:36,599
And,

985
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:36,860
and,

986
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,139
and,

987
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,400
and I suppose learned knowledge as opposed to just from like,

988
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,679
you know,

989
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,719
experience-based knowledge,

990
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,780
ton of experience,

991
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:42,960
right?

992
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,599
I'll chuck myself,

993
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,820
I'll chuck myself in situations and I've always learned well like that.

994
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:46,099
Yeah.

995
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,019
Put myself in a situation,

996
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:49,380
learn from that experience and then that's my learning.

997
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,739
But there's a ton of learning out there through podcasts,

998
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,500
through reading,

999
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,159
seminars,

1000
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,199
courses,

1001
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,539
and I don't invest myself in those enough.

1002
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,980
And I know why I've got ADHD.

1003
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,320
I've had it my whole life and I've been treated for it and I've,

1004
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:05,199
the whole lot.

1005
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,179
But it's a thing.

1006
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,719
I can say,

1007
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:07,840
yeah,

1008
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,719
I've got it and I acknowledge it.

1009
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,480
It doesn't mean it goes away.

1010
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:09,780
Yeah.

1011
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,420
I find it really hard to learn in that environment.

1012
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,579
I've always learned really well in,

1013
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,480
getting my hands dirty.

1014
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:16,900
But just because it's there,

1015
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,760
I shouldn't just dismiss it.

1016
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,079
I do need to better myself in that area.

1017
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:21,719
So I am extremely curious.

1018
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,539
And I think I could be a much better leader and a lot more successful if I

1019
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:30,239
applied myself a little bit more and actually did the hard things.

1020
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,280
And the hard things for me are go learn some stuff.

1021
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,800
It's fascinating because the first part of that is actually understanding

1022
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,659
yourself well enough,

1023
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,699
which most people don't get to there and then identifying that.

1024
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:39,960
And as you've done all your life,

1025
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
you then find a way to make that happen.

1026
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,619
So I wouldn't back against you,

1027
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,420
in that space or any other spot.

1028
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,199
I was thinking as you were talking,

1029
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
and one of the things is being less involved in the hospitality industry,

1030
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,340
but growing up,

1031
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,420
we lived upstairs in pubs and venues and it's not the same passion for me

1032
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,480
that it clearly is for you,

1033
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,920
but my family have been involved.

1034
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,260
I didn't think there was a great sharing economy where everyone was so busy

1035
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,139
doing their own world,

1036
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,440
trying to survive that,

1037
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:05,880
you know,

1038
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,480
the lessons that you've got from a lot,

1039
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,699
are they shared enough?

1040
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,539
Have you gone to other great restauranteurs and hospitality experts?

1041
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:13,460
Have you found that you're,

1042
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,800
you've learned through that lens or is that not happen?

1043
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,139
Um,

1044
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,039
you know,

1045
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:19,639
yes,

1046
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,800
I think there is a restaurant tours do create their own little communities

1047
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,559
within the industry and share knowledge.

1048
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,440
Um,

1049
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:30,139
and I have learned from those things and I do dip my toe in

1050
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:30,960
that every now and then,

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,619
because I think it's nice to have a finger on the pulse and

1052
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,340
understand what other people are going through.

1053
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,199
But I think the issues that are,

1054
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,719
they're not unique to hospitality,

1055
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:39,380
you know,

1056
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,679
the issues are issues across every business.

1057
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,340
And I've always had a re I've never been a,

1058
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,239
like I love sport,

1059
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,960
but I've never been lucky enough to play as team sport my whole life,

1060
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,900
not even in school.

1061
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,260
Never.

1062
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:51,760
The connection I've got through sport is through people like yourself and the

1063
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,159
clubs.

1064
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,659
But I see the faces we fight that the issues we face in

1065
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,800
hospitality and sporting clubs,

1066
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,440
very similar.

1067
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:57,980
You know,

1068
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,179
we go into battle every day,

1069
00:39:59,179 --> 00:39:59,480
you know,

1070
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,679
in an AFL,

1071
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,579
they play a game once a week.

1072
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:03,079
We play a game twice or twice a day.

1073
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:03,400
Yeah.

1074
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,840
Um,

1075
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,219
but very,

1076
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:05,739
very similar.

1077
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:06,340
It's about team.

1078
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,460
It's about building people.

1079
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:07,960
Um,

1080
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,360
the same thing as leadership succession planning,

1081
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,579
ins outs the executive,

1082
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,219
we've got it all.

1083
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:13,320
Yeah.

1084
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,579
Yeah.

1085
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,159
Um,

1086
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,840
and I tried to learn from my community rather than just from my internal

1087
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
hospitality community.

1088
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:19,500
Um,

1089
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,940
but I'm always,

1090
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,760
and I like to listen to the struggles that my other people are having

1091
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,380
because I learned,

1092
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:23,960
I learned a ton.

1093
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,219
And that's what we love is that,

1094
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:25,559
you know,

1095
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,579
exactly what we're doing.

1096
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,679
Hopefully this podcast is,

1097
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,539
is that it's,

1098
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:28,840
it's,

1099
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,960
it's about different people from vast variety of backgrounds that are

1100
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,679
coming together,

1101
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,880
but there are these shared traits that come through and you're picking them

1102
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,119
up,

1103
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:38,280
uh,

1104
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,699
listening to Shane right now and he's incredible,

1105
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,199
um,

1106
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,840
life story so far.

1107
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,340
We're communicating with clarity.

1108
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,659
I mean,

1109
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,679
you're a natural communicator.

1110
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,460
You present incredibly well,

1111
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,320
but have you thought really about your communication and how you go about

1112
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,380
it?

1113
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:52,860
Yeah,

1114
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,519
it could be better.

1115
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,360
Um,

1116
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,739
I think it could be better.

1117
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,239
Um,

1118
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:56,659
and again,

1119
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:57,619
it comes down to,

1120
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:58,099
uh,

1121
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:58,739
um,

1122
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,360
education.

1123
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,940
I think as well,

1124
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,239
you know,

1125
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,500
my vocabulary could be better.

1126
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:01,960
I think that,

1127
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,119
you know,

1128
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:02,320
you can,

1129
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,840
you can use the skills you have and the tools you have.

1130
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,599
And we have English as a language master that to be able to connect

1131
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,400
better to people,

1132
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,079
not to,

1133
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,719
not to elevate yourself.

1134
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,679
And put yourself in an elitist position where people don't want to

1135
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,300
connect with you.

1136
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,019
I think you,

1137
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,739
but you need to have more strings to your bow.

1138
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,360
Um,

1139
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,500
and,

1140
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,500
and I need to grow,

1141
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,000
grow myself,

1142
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:21,260
grow,

1143
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,219
grow that part of my communication.

1144
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
But I think also learning how to actually be in a room with someone

1145
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,300
and look them in the eye and use the tools you have,

1146
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,480
you know,

1147
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:29,639
you,

1148
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:30,139
I'm a,

1149
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:30,820
I'm a wog.

1150
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,320
I can't help it.

1151
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,219
I use my hands too much,

1152
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,320
but,

1153
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,360
but,

1154
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,119
but I think,

1155
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:34,360
you know,

1156
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,300
smiling and,

1157
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,280
and connecting and,

1158
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,500
and,

1159
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:36,880
and,

1160
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,199
you know,

1161
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,519
you know,

1162
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:39,860
the,

1163
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,219
the,

1164
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:40,500
the,

1165
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,840
the aura that you present,

1166
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,340
um,

1167
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,500
and,

1168
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:42,820
and that,

1169
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,139
that,

1170
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,119
that you push onto people means a lot.

1171
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,519
I think communication is,

1172
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,420
is really important.

1173
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:48,019
And,

1174
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,440
and I like to think that when I'm speaking to someone,

1175
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,099
I'm,

1176
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:51,960
I'm connecting with them.

1177
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:52,579
Um,

1178
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,320
if I'm investing in them and I care for them,

1179
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,139
then I'll show that,

1180
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:55,480
you know,

1181
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,039
whether it's,

1182
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,159
whether it's happiness,

1183
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,239
whether it's anger,

1184
00:41:59,239 --> 00:41:59,900
whether it's,

1185
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,159
you know,

1186
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:00,679
sadness,

1187
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,159
whatever.

1188
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:01,820
Um,

1189
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,219
I think you need to really leave an impression on someone.

1190
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:04,860
So,

1191
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,119
um,

1192
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,639
but it could always be a bit better.

1193
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,639
I hope you don't mind sharing this story.

1194
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,179
Um,

1195
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:11,500
we were talking just before we started recording and I was saying,

1196
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:11,739
um,

1197
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:12,699
my 15 year old,

1198
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,440
my third eldest,

1199
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:13,820
uh,

1200
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,840
working as a glassy,

1201
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,679
uh,

1202
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,719
in one of our venues,

1203
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:16,940
uh,

1204
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,699
Melbourne public at the moment and teenage boys,

1205
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:19,980
you know,

1206
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,019
they're not full of words as a rule,

1207
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:22,639
uh,

1208
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,500
but seeing him outside of the family,

1209
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,159
having learned to smile to customers,

1210
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,679
having learned,

1211
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,139
and he's practicing his three plate carry Shane and he's,

1212
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:30,960
he's out,

1213
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:31,420
you know,

1214
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,719
pubs are interesting spaces.

1215
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:33,320
You know,

1216
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,239
people are looking at him.

1217
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,960
How old are you?

1218
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:35,760
How come you're here?

1219
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,840
He's having to communicate in ways.

1220
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,099
And you were saying the same,

1221
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,579
you've got your young daughter now on the floor at Maha,

1222
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,960
and it's been a positive experience for her as well.

1223
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:44,440
Unbelievable.

1224
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:44,639
And,

1225
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,179
and like,

1226
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
we all love our kids.

1227
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,659
That's right.

1228
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:46,860
I mean,

1229
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,619
that's at the end of the day,

1230
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,780
that that's your core drive.

1231
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,940
You have to look after your kids and give them the tools they need to

1232
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,300
succeed.

1233
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,860
You know,

1234
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,039
and,

1235
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,400
and I felt I'd been given that,

1236
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,800
um,

1237
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:55,920
as,

1238
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,539
as a child.

1239
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:57,340
Um,

1240
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,139
my daughter,

1241
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,480
I mean,

1242
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,179
like you said that,

1243
00:42:59,179 --> 00:42:59,400
you know,

1244
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,079
we look about the hospitality industry cup of beating.

1245
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,059
What about all these students?

1246
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,579
You know,

1247
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,179
in all like my daughter's last full year of school was grade five,

1248
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,059
um,

1249
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,599
grade six in year seven,

1250
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,699
she was in lockdown.

1251
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,619
So now she's in year eight.

1252
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,440
She went from a Catholic primary school into a private secondary school,

1253
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,079
went through puberty in between,

1254
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,800
um,

1255
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,659
lost all her mates.

1256
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:18,780
Hasn't had any time to,

1257
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,239
I suppose,

1258
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,179
sign off from grade six and then get inducted into year seven.

1259
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,480
And her self-esteem went to shit.

1260
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:24,900
Yeah.

1261
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,199
You know,

1262
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:25,500
like,

1263
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:25,820
you know,

1264
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,800
didn't know how to communicate.

1265
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:28,119
Everything's on an iPad,

1266
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,179
felt really introverted,

1267
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:31,340
you know,

1268
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,579
didn't want to go outside,

1269
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:33,519
didn't want to do anything.

1270
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:35,380
And my wife and I were really concerned,

1271
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:35,659
you know,

1272
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:35,820
like,

1273
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,659
cause she's such a smart,

1274
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,579
beautiful person.

1275
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,260
You can't start like that.

1276
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:39,679
You know,

1277
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,519
like you need to actually,

1278
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,280
you have some confidence.

1279
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,980
So I just said,

1280
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,019
do you need to get into like coming to the restaurant?

1281
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:45,940
And she's like,

1282
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,260
what do you mean?

1283
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,500
I'm like,

1284
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,039
you need to get into the restaurant.

1285
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:48,539
You need to,

1286
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:48,940
you need to,

1287
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,260
you need to be around other people.

1288
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,119
You need to see how adults engage and see how young people engage.

1289
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:56,860
You need to feel that energy in a room and that power when there's people around you.

1290
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,000
And,

1291
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:58,800
and you're either going to thrive from it,

1292
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,119
but you,

1293
00:43:59,400 --> 00:43:59,920
or not,

1294
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:00,679
but you're going to learn.

1295
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:01,519
Um,

1296
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,900
and she's jumped in and just made,

1297
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,420
I hate it.

1298
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,639
Cause she's a natural at hospitality.

1299
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:08,099
And I'm sorry,

1300
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,300
I don't want her to be in hospitality.

1301
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,900
she's got,

1302
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,239
she's got,

1303
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,780
she's got it.

1304
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,159
And I'm like,

1305
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,639
she's like,

1306
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:12,800
dad,

1307
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,619
maybe I could just do this.

1308
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:13,860
I'm like,

1309
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,480
no chance.

1310
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:15,400
You're going to school.

1311
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,320
It's in the DNA,

1312
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:16,760
mate,

1313
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,119
isn't it?

1314
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,039
And it's brilliant,

1315
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:18,440
isn't it?

1316
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,639
That,

1317
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:19,559
that shared passion.

1318
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,059
And I,

1319
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,460
I can feel the pride in,

1320
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:21,880
in,

1321
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:22,800
in your conversation.

1322
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,280
And also it's an important story to tell.

1323
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,460
I mean,

1324
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,260
people around the country,

1325
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,900
maybe not understanding as you explained it for kids that missed two years,

1326
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,360
effectively,

1327
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,679
there's a whole heap of challenges out there.

1328
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:31,900
And,

1329
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,880
and maybe things like getting a job and the way it's unfolded for your daughter.

1330
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,280
And my,

1331
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,039
my third eldest is,

1332
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,480
is a brilliant story.

1333
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:40,699
We,

1334
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:40,880
we,

1335
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,699
we see leaders are really passionate about how they collaborate.

1336
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,079
You,

1337
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,699
you don't create profitable without some serious collaboration.

1338
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:49,500
You don't create Maha and your food empire,

1339
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,119
that collaboration.

1340
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:53,360
How do you value collaboration and how have you gone about it?

1341
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,000
Uh,

1342
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:54,280
yeah,

1343
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,320
more so now.

1344
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,340
Um,

1345
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,300
and it's hard cause you get burnt too,

1346
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,519
right?

1347
00:44:58,679 --> 00:44:59,000
I mean,

1348
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
not everything's going to be rosy.

1349
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:00,500
And I think that's,

1350
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:00,940
that's a,

1351
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,699
that's a key part about valuing good collaboration,

1352
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:05,380
you know,

1353
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,159
getting burnt in,

1354
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:06,760
in,

1355
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,119
in,

1356
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,659
in relationships that don't work out.

1357
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:08,860
Yeah.

1358
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,480
It doesn't have to be a negative experience.

1359
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:10,739
I mean,

1360
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:13,679
you can learn a lot from that and it doesn't have to be resentment that you

1361
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:13,940
learn,

1362
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,260
but you learn the value of a good partnership.

1363
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,079
Um,

1364
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:19,380
but good partnerships are built through trust and,

1365
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:19,739
and,

1366
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:20,639
and,

1367
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:20,820
and,

1368
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,940
and just being transparent,

1369
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:22,820
you know,

1370
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,360
collaboration can be really good,

1371
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,159
but if you know exactly what you're getting,

1372
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,460
yeah,

1373
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,519
what you sign up for is what you're going to get fine.

1374
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:29,500
Um,

1375
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,199
but collaboration is important cause you can only do so much on your own,

1376
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,519
whether it's your team and the people that you employ.

1377
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,179
Um,

1378
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,400
if you look at them as employees and I hate it when people say I work for,

1379
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:38,639
no,

1380
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:39,400
it works for me.

1381
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,300
Everyone works with me.

1382
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,300
Now we work together to get something done and we have to make sure that we're,

1383
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,000
we're totally aligned and where we want to achieve or it's an external party

1384
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,920
that we're bringing in or it's a partner,

1385
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,460
you know,

1386
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,900
someone that we're actually physically partnering with and financially

1387
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,300
partnering with to achieve a goal.

1388
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,000
We all have to be on the same page.

1389
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,659
Um,

1390
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,380
we have to be invested and we have to make sure that we're very transparent

1391
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,199
about where we want to be.

1392
00:45:59,579 --> 00:45:59,940
Um,

1393
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,440
because if we're saying we want to end up in a spot where we're going to sell

1394
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:04,960
for X,

1395
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,500
let's do that.

1396
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,539
But if one person doesn't actually really,

1397
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,059
believe that it's never going to work.

1398
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,079
So it's,

1399
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:11,320
it's,

1400
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,519
you have to be transparent.

1401
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:13,280
Well,

1402
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,639
it's a great point to make a shame because you can talk about collaboration,

1403
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,139
but it is important to talk about the other side of it.

1404
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:19,619
and,

1405
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,280
and I've certainly,

1406
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:22,900
I think you're not trying if you're not going to come across,

1407
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,960
uh,

1408
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,480
relationships that don't work in partnership and in collaboration.

1409
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:27,360
Someone in this podcast,

1410
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,679
and I can't think of who it was.

1411
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,659
This is what great partnerships look like.

1412
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:32,559
You've got to have shared vision without that,

1413
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:32,820
you know,

1414
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,380
chance shared values and then complimentary capabilities.

1415
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,039
You don't have to be able to do the same thing to get in fact,

1416
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:38,320
it's better.

1417
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,539
If you,

1418
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:38,880
you don't,

1419
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,960
you bring different skillset,

1420
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,619
but if you don't cross the first two,

1421
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,579
it's never going to work.

1422
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,539
And does that make sense to you?

1423
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:45,780
Is it?

1424
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,840
I think it's exactly what I was saying.

1425
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:48,119
I think,

1426
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:48,440
you know,

1427
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:48,940
um,

1428
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,179
I think something else as well in a,

1429
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,800
in a partnership and partnership sometimes,

1430
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,119
uh,

1431
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,619
sometimes can be slave and master.

1432
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:55,519
Um,

1433
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:57,280
just be careful of that,

1434
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,760
you know,

1435
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,619
cause if I've been in negotiations with partners before where you really need

1436
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:01,800
them,

1437
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,219
right.

1438
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,260
And you're in a partnership because you need the other person.

1439
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,019
They need their skills.

1440
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:05,960
Cause if you had those skills,

1441
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,119
you probably wouldn't be in partnership and,

1442
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:08,559
and they may,

1443
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:09,920
they may overflex or,

1444
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,639
um,

1445
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:13,119
their position in those times when you need them,

1446
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,219
that's toxic.

1447
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:15,139
Um,

1448
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,800
because all you're doing in that position is actually showing your true card

1449
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,059
and your true hand and that you don't actually give a shit about this

1450
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:22,420
partnership.

1451
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,320
It's transactional.

1452
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:24,019
Um,

1453
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,260
and especially you've been led to believe that it's not transactional.

1454
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,900
It's a partnership.

1455
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:27,760
Um,

1456
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,420
once that trust has been broken,

1457
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:30,380
um,

1458
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,199
it's never going to work.

1459
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:31,980
Um,

1460
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,659
because there's always going to be that little bit of doubt,

1461
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:34,619
um,

1462
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,599
sometimes resentment,

1463
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,280
um,

1464
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,079
and the trust is broken.

1465
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:37,719
I mean,

1466
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:38,599
trust is really important.

1467
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,500
It doesn't have to be in any type of partnership.

1468
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:40,420
It doesn't have to be respect.

1469
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,420
Trust and respect are two very different things.

1470
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,300
Um,

1471
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,639
I think that if you trust that they're going to do the right thing by it,

1472
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,380
get it done.

1473
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,760
Great life lesson,

1474
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,179
uh,

1475
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:49,619
in that one,

1476
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:50,659
no doubt that Shane,

1477
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:50,980
for me,

1478
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:53,480
we've been asking all the inspirational leaders,

1479
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,099
which you firmly fit in that category.

1480
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,659
These two final questions,

1481
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,239
who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1482
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,559
Ooh.

1483
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,199
Uh,

1484
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,780
wow.

1485
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,739
Um,

1486
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:07,519
the greatest,

1487
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:07,820
I mean,

1488
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,019
I,

1489
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:08,280
uh,

1490
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,880
I always,

1491
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,320
I always,

1492
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:11,760
and I,

1493
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,559
I don't know what other people say.

1494
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,579
I don't really care to be honest.

1495
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:15,980
I always look back at,

1496
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:17,039
at my father.

1497
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,760
Um,

1498
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,599
I think that,

1499
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:19,300
um,

1500
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,159
you know,

1501
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:22,239
he's not a born leader.

1502
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,260
You know,

1503
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,159
he's not a leader of men.

1504
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:25,739
He doesn't surround himself with a lot of people.

1505
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,699
Wouldn't profess to having hundreds of friends,

1506
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:28,619
you know,

1507
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,860
not the most vocal person in a room.

1508
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:31,860
Um,

1509
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,679
but he just does what it needs to get done.

1510
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,400
You know,

1511
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,840
he,

1512
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,219
he does what he needs to do.

1513
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,019
He's selfless.

1514
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,260
Um,

1515
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,219
he's honorable and vulnerable,

1516
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:42,280
you know,

1517
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,079
and I think that they're really,

1518
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,539
they're really key characteristics.

1519
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:45,420
Um,

1520
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,599
and I also have seen his four flaws and he admits them.

1521
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,039
And I've seen his evolution,

1522
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:50,820
you know,

1523
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,639
from being that,

1524
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:51,940
you know,

1525
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,360
young,

1526
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,219
hardworking father who may be insecure and,

1527
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,900
um,

1528
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,059
carrying his own demons,

1529
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,199
just pushing through and trying to get it done and burying his head in the sand and sticking to what he knows.

1530
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,380
So now seeing a guy who's,

1531
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,719
you know,

1532
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,320
older,

1533
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,320
wiser,

1534
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,440
um,

1535
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:07,519
less armed,

1536
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,500
um,

1537
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:09,039
more,

1538
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,500
more respected to himself,

1539
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,760
probably carrying less baggage,

1540
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,260
um,

1541
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,760
and probably a better person now than he's ever been,

1542
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,260
um,

1543
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,260
and more vulnerable.

1544
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
And I think that's vulnerable leadership.

1545
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,260
So important,

1546
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,760
um,

1547
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
being able to admit when things aren't right and,

1548
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,260
and,

1549
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,260
and say it openly.

1550
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,760
Um,

1551
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,260
I think having those leaders around you is something that's really valuable.

1552
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,760
Yeah.

1553
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
What a brilliant answer.

1554
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,260
And,

1555
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,760
you know,

1556
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,260
the people that have been lucky enough to have a great parental influence,

1557
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
they often go right there because,

1558
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,260
and it's not for everyone because we realize that's pretty special and it's obviously been a massive part of,

1559
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,260
of your life.

1560
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,760
Um,

1561
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,260
I love that that generation now,

1562
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
as you're saying vulnerable has been sort of the,

1563
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,260
the,

1564
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:44,760
the,

1565
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,760
the catchphrase for leadership in the last four or five years.

1566
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,760
But for that generation,

1567
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,260
that wasn't an option at all.

1568
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,760
So for him,

1569
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,260
as you said,

1570
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,760
to evolve into that space now is,

1571
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,260
is pretty special,

1572
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,760
isn't it?

1573
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,260
Yeah,

1574
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,760
no,

1575
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,260
it is.

1576
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,760
It is a lot.

1577
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,260
It is real.

1578
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,760
But I think to be honest,

1579
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,260
it's something that he probably always longed for.

1580
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,760
Um,

1581
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,260
and,

1582
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,760
but,

1583
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,260
you know,

1584
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,760
it wasn't,

1585
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,260
it wasn't,

1586
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,760
you can't,

1587
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,260
we couldn't say that,

1588
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,760
you know,

1589
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,260
you know,

1590
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,760
big men don't cry,

1591
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,260
you know,

1592
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,760
and,

1593
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,260
and,

1594
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:05,760
and,

1595
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,260
um,

1596
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:07,960
I think for him,

1597
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,260
even understanding that he could be that as a man,

1598
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,059
as a leader,

1599
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:12,260
as a father,

1600
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:12,460
um,

1601
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,559
was something that wasn't even on,

1602
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:13,760
on,

1603
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
on the cards.

1604
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,360
Um,

1605
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:15,659
so yeah,

1606
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:16,260
I think it's,

1607
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,460
it's,

1608
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,559
it's a big credit to him.

1609
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,059
And it's redefining leadership too,

1610
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:19,260
Shane.

1611
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:19,460
We,

1612
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
we're really passionate.

1613
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,260
You don't need a title.

1614
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,860
You don't have to have had a massive business.

1615
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,860
You don't have to have had 50 people in your team.

1616
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,460
The impact that he's had on you is incredible leadership.

1617
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,159
And you don't need a title is,

1618
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:31,659
is what we're passionate about.

1619
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:33,460
We love the idea of collaboration,

1620
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,760
Shane.

1621
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:33,860
If,

1622
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,659
if you could collaborate,

1623
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,559
collaborate with anyone in the world on anything,

1624
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,659
any part of your life,

1625
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,260
uh,

1626
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,260
what,

1627
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:39,960
who would it be?

1628
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,559
And if it,

1629
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,659
is there someone that springs to mind?

1630
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:44,460
Uh,

1631
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,239
um,

1632
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:48,340
oh,

1633
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,739
maybe with you,

1634
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:49,239
Dars.

1635
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:52,139
I'm always,

1636
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:54,340
always like pubs.

1637
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:54,539
Mate,

1638
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,340
I'd love to do that,

1639
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,639
mate.

1640
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:56,340
That would be a,

1641
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:56,539
yeah.

1642
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:58,139
I'm not sure what I bring to the table though,

1643
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:58,539
Shane,

1644
00:50:58,539 --> 00:50:58,739
but,

1645
00:50:58,739 --> 00:50:59,340
uh,

1646
00:50:59,340 --> 00:50:59,639
oh,

1647
00:50:59,639 --> 00:50:59,840
you,

1648
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,440
you got a few inches on me.

1649
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:02,539
Oh,

1650
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:02,739
look,

1651
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:02,940
I,

1652
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,340
I don't know,

1653
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:03,440
mate.

1654
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:03,940
I'm not the,

1655
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,139
um,

1656
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:04,440
I,

1657
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,739
I really,

1658
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:05,940
and,

1659
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,739
and this is another flaw,

1660
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:09,840
I'm not tuned in to a lot of things.

1661
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,739
Um,

1662
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:11,239
I don't,

1663
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,239
I'm not a,

1664
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,039
a fanboy.

1665
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:13,639
Like,

1666
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,239
I don't look up to a lot of people.

1667
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:15,539
Yeah.

1668
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,539
Um,

1669
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:16,840
I,

1670
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,039
I,

1671
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,940
I really value the people I've surrounded myself with,

1672
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,539
but there's no one that I'll look,

1673
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:21,739
like,

1674
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:23,739
I don't even know what's happening in my,

1675
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:24,139
you know,

1676
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:24,840
globally,

1677
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,440
you know,

1678
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,639
I,

1679
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:26,639
I haven't got time,

1680
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:26,940
you know,

1681
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,039
I look at my own world.

1682
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:28,440
Um,

1683
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,039
so I don't look at,

1684
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:29,340
you know,

1685
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,539
like what's happening with,

1686
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:31,039
um,

1687
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:31,840
the Musk guy,

1688
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,239
Elon Musk and all these guys.

1689
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:33,739
The Musk guy.

1690
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:33,940
Yeah,

1691
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,239
like,

1692
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:34,639
I don't know.

1693
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:34,840
I,

1694
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,039
I think I've got a great opportunity to sit down

1695
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,840
and talk with people like yourself and like Ed

1696
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,239
and,

1697
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:40,539
um,

1698
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:41,139
you know,

1699
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,940
Bart and Dave Elliott and all these guys and,

1700
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,239
you know,

1701
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:45,940
all my friends,

1702
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,239
you know,

1703
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:48,239
like I've got so many great friends that we can talk

1704
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,940
to and they're the guys that I want to collaborate

1705
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,639
with and they're the guys we do collaborate with,

1706
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:51,940
you know,

1707
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,239
so I'm,

1708
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,139
I'm lucky.

1709
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:56,039
Shane has just mentioned a few names that people

1710
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:56,539
who,

1711
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:56,940
you know,

1712
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,039
in his humble way,

1713
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:59,639
but he's talking about Ed McGuire who,

1714
00:51:59,639 --> 00:51:59,940
you know,

1715
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,039
he's had a long relationship.

1716
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:03,340
Bart Campbell's a great leader in our space.

1717
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,239
David Elliott is the,

1718
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:04,539
the,

1719
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:04,739
the,

1720
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:05,539
the CEO host plus.

1721
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,840
So Shane's just quietly,

1722
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,239
uh,

1723
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,639
as connected to anyone,

1724
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:09,940
but in that same humble way,

1725
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,539
they're not transactional relationships,

1726
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:11,739
uh,

1727
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:12,039
Shane,

1728
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:12,239
you,

1729
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:14,239
you give and don't expect in return.

1730
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:14,739
I think,

1731
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:15,039
you know,

1732
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,440
I've loved this,

1733
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,239
this medium cause I've been able to,

1734
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:18,440
you know,

1735
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,639
know you for a long period of time,

1736
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,139
but I feel like I get your essence even more.

1737
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:22,440
Uh,

1738
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,340
it's an incredible success story,

1739
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,239
um,

1740
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,340
and open and you're,

1741
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,840
you're full of owning your own mistakes,

1742
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,039
mate,

1743
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,139
which we all need to do and learn more from.

1744
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:30,940
So thanks,

1745
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,039
mate.

1746
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:32,440
I really appreciate you taking the time today.

1747
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,539
No,

1748
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:33,139
it's been good.

1749
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,440
Good to see you mate.

1750
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,239
