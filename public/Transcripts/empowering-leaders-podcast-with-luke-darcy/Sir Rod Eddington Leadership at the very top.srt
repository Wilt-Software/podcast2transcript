1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,580
Well I think the search for the truth is always the most important piece of the jigsaw and too

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,120
often you have your facts and I have mine and we're not prepared to debate in a Socratic way.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,820
People confuse opinions with facts and of course we're all entitled to our own opinions

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,219
but we should at least be able to agree on the facts and fake news is the real problem.

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,160
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Sir Rod Eddington. From the humble

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,500
beginnings of growing up in country Western Australia to being one of the most respected

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,380
business leaders in the world. Sir Rod talks about the four basic questions he asks of everyone

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,579
to understand a business, build connection with people and listening before implementing anything.

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,420
Just trying to build up a mental picture of how people saw British Airways,

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,179
what they believed the challenges were, what do you think's broken and how would you fix it?

11
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,320
Sir Rod also talks about his lifelong friendship and connection to Rupert Murdoch

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,520
and his unique understanding of media having spent a couple of decades

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,480
on the Global News Limited board.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Rupert's always been passionate about getting to the bottom of stuff,

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,439
the facts, what are the facts and to be relentlessly curious to find new ways of doing things

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,519
and not to be a prisoner of the past. That takes some doing. You can't spend too much

17
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,500
time looking in the rear vision mirror Luke. It's people like Sir Rod Eddington who inspire

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,760
the work we do at Alita. Check out our Alita Connect program where we bring together leaders

24
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,060
Sir Rod Eddington AO is a highly distinguished Australian businessman and community leader.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Sir Rod was the Managing Director of Cathay Pacific, Chair of Ansett Australia,

26
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,200
Deputy Chair of News Limited and Chief Executive of British Airways before

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,699
retiring from executive duties. He holds first class honours degree in engineering,

28
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,280
a Master of Engineering and a PhD in the Department of Engineering Science at the

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,280
University of Oxford where he also played first class cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club.

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,599
In 1974 Sir Rod was the Rhodes Scholar from Western Australia. Sir Rod has received a

31
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,919
British Knighthood in 2005 for services to the aviation industry, was appointed the Officer

32
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,860
of the Order of Australia in 2012 for distinguished service to business and commerce through roles

33
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,159
with a range of national and international economic trade,

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,639
infrastructure development and transport organisations and was awarded the Grand

35
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,340
Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government in 2015 for his contribution

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,240
to strengthening the economic relations between Australia and Japan. Sir Rod, it's an incredible

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,060
life of success. At 74 years of age, I'm reading your history back to you. What's the thing that

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,560
gives you the most pride? That I'm still going, Luke. That I get up in the morning and I really

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,139
look forward to that. That I get up in the morning and I really look forward to that. That I get up in the morning and I really look forward to that. That I get up in the morning and I really look forward to that.

40
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,639
That I get up in the morning and I really look forward to that. That's the thing that gives me a real kick.

41
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,860
Right now you're about to head into the city and there's so many more exciting things to do. Is that

42
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,199
constant never-ending self-improvement journey? That's it. Absolutely part of it. I learned

43
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,939
something yesterday. I learned something today. I learned something tomorrow and I love being in the

44
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,180
swim. And you don't look back too often. There's some serious achievement there, Rod. Is there one

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,900
that you think, God, that was a great chapter in particular? When I retired from British Airways,

46
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,680
I'd had the better part of 30 years in aviation. Someone said to me, what were you most proud of?

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,919
And pride's a sort of a mixed emotion for me. The thing I think I got the most satisfaction out of

48
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:57,699
was that in all my time in aviation, we never lost an aeroplane. And that wasn't about me.

49
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,280
That was about the people who put safety and security first in the business. So I get a kick

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,039
out of that. You can never take safety for granted in aviation. Passengers can take it for granted.

51
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,120
But the people who work and run airlines can't. So that was the thing I got the biggest kick out of.

52
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,500
Rod, not many Rhodes scholars can play first class cricket. You grew up in country Western

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,120
Australia and played cricket alongside the great Rod Marsh. John Inverarity is a name that people

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,600
will know really well and legends of WA cricket. If you had your time and you could maybe give back

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,079
a bit of business success to play more cricket, would you do that?

56
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,079
No, I got the balance right. I was a journeyman. I loved playing. I loved playing with,

57
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,079
people who were better than me. And I learned a lot from people like Bacchus, Rod Marsh and from

58
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:52,040
John Inverarity. Bacchus sadly no more. Inver's still in great shape. I learned a lot and sport,

59
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,199
I think, teaches you a lot. There are very few things in life where you get direct feedback,

60
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,399
Luke. You get it in sport. It's called the scoreboard. At the end of the game, you look up

61
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,600
at the scoreboard and you've either won or lost and you've either had a good day personally or a

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,540
bad day. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback.

63
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,139
It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,439
It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback. It's feedback.

65
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,060
And I think that makes you stronger.

66
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,120
The Rhodes Scholarship is regarded as the world's most prestigious academic program in the world.

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,259
And to attend the world-renowned Oxford University, they identify young leaders from around the

68
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,720
globe they believe can make a difference in the world. 1974, you're the Rhodes Scholar from Western

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,980
Australia. Tell me about that experience. Well, I arrived at Oxford never really having

70
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,480
been outside Australia before, wondering what to make of it. Loved every minute of it. It was a

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,660
different world in many ways. Lots of really capable people. You know, I grew up in WA and

72
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,000
went to school and university with some really good people, but you get to Oxford and you're

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,779
surrounded by people who are really smart and clever and many of them good people. So for me,

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,279
that was a complete eye-opener. I think Winston Churchill said that the Americans and the British

75
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,240
were two peoples separated by a common language. I think that's true of Australia and Britain.

76
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,399
I'd grown up in a household where...

77
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,079
My father had been a pilot in Britain during the war and lived to tell the tale and always

78
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,699
thought the Brits were good sorts, apart from when the Ashes series was on. And so I got there

79
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,519
sort of with a positive mindset. Getting a Rhodes Scholarship changed my life, really.

80
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,019
And I loved every minute of it.

81
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,480
Well, I heard a story that you're sitting around at Oxford and the crew that founded

82
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,620
antibiotics are in your sphere. Can you share with us a bit of that story?

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,180
So Luke, I was a graduate student at Lincoln,

84
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,720
at Oxford. Everyone who's in the university is also a member of a college. And I was a member

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,300
of Lincoln College, Oxford during my postgraduate days. And Howard Florey, Lord Florey, a South

86
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,540
Australian Rhodes Scholar, had been at Lincoln College, Oxford. And Florey had been responsible

87
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,019
for taking the bug that was penicillin, the fungus, I think it was, and turning it into

88
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,100
the world's most famous biotic, antibiotic.

89
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:23,240
And so I was privileged enough to sit and listen to them talk about the penicillin journey,

90
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:31,100
how they took what was seen initially as an obscure fungus that killed bugs in a Petri dish

91
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,920
and turned it into something that saved countless lives. And understanding how they'd got from

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,459
that, and how they'd got from that, and how they'd got from that, and how they'd got from that,

93
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:38,480
and how they'd got from that, and how they'd got from that, and how they'd got from that,

94
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,720
to that point of a Petri dish to a world-class global antibiotic was remarkable. And they'd

95
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,100
done it on the smell of an oily rag.

96
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
It's an incredible story, isn't it?

97
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,000
It's extraordinary.

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,300
Is it true they literally use themselves as guinea pigs?

99
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,139
Well, indeed, what they did was they had to develop this, and they had very limited resources.

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:05,600
They had some help from America, but having developed the drug and knowing that it could

101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,459
kill bacteria, they had to work on it.

102
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:13,800
They had to work out how much to give people, how often to give it to people, all of these things.

103
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:22,540
And it was wartime, and there was really no time to have a great series of trials with laboratory mice.

104
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,420
So they literally used it to treat people who were probably going to die anyway of things like

105
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,779
septicemia, blood poisoning, and they effectively trialed it on people. And those sort of things

106
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,440
happen in wartime, I think. And they did remarkable work, but they

107
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,679
did it literally on the smell of an oily rag. And they produced, one of them who was still

108
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:52,759
an academic at Lincoln when I was there, Norman Heatley, who was a wonderful man. I remember him

109
00:08:52,759 --> 00:09:00,440
saying to me that their goal was to produce enough penicillin so that when the invasion of Europe

110
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,600
took place, as it did in 1944, they had enough penicillin to treat the wounded. Now, that's a

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
pretty big goal.

112
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah.

113
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,559
And they were able to deliver it. They were remarkable people, and they didn't have all the

114
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,519
laboratory space and infrastructure that people have today.

115
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,720
So how inspiring is that for a young boy who loves his cricket and did well academically

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,399
from Western Australia, grew up in the country, your dad was a banker, you moved country town,

117
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,320
suddenly you're sitting in the most prestigious university in the world, arguably.

118
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
That's it.

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,879
Was that something that you thought, wow, I can make a difference? Did that happen?

120
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,120
Well, it is the art of the possible, Luke, I think. It's up to you at the end of the day.

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,080
But you're in a place with people who have achieved extraordinary things, miracles almost.

122
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,879
You know, I would argue that Howard Florey, for instance, was probably the most famous

123
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,360
South Australian in many ways. There's a walk in Adelaide of, on the footpath, famous South

124
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,600
Australians, and I think Florey's at the beginning of it, and I reckon that's about right. But it

125
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,639
tells you that if you work hard, you absolutely commit yourself to what you do. There's no prize

126
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,320
for not doing what you do. There's no prize for not doing what you do. There's no prize for not

127
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,039
giving it your best shot. And this group did.

128
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,840
And so did you. You go on to be knighted for your services to the aviation industry, and

129
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,000
in particular for your role as the CEO of British Airways. What type of leader were you? A famous

130
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,960
organisation like British Airways. What type of leader were you in that role?

131
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,919
Well, I think because I'd worked in the aviation industry, Luke,

132
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:38,080
for Cathay Pacific and Ansett before I went to British Airways, I'd been in the industry for,

133
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,559
for quite a while. But I think it's a great mistake to think that because you know a

134
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,919
particular problem, let's say in Cathay Pacific or Ansett, that the same problem

135
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,759
in British Airways has the same solution, different time, different place. I arrived

136
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:01,840
there in early 2000, and I always try and spend the first few weeks listening to frontline staff,

137
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,000
to customers, to my fellow managers, shareholders, suppliers. You want to know about an airline,

138
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,440
go talk to Boeing or Rolls Royce, because they sell aeroplanes or engines to everybody.

139
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
Just trying to build up a mental picture of how people saw British Airways,

140
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,559
what they believed the challenges were. I always had

141
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,159
sort of three or four questions. What do you like about what we do? What don't you like about what

142
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,799
we do? What do you think is broken and how would you fix it? So you build up a picture of how

143
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,000
the people who you're going to be working with see the entity you're in. And having done that, you can

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,539
then get about trying to make it better.

145
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,940
And I had five and a half years of doing that.

146
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:48,399
You made the, I'm assuming, tough decision to retire the famous Concorde.

147
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,200
Can you give those listening that maybe don't understand the nostalgia around the Concorde,

148
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,440
what it did and its place in aviation?

149
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,259
That must have been a big call.

150
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,019
Can you talk us through that?

151
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,159
Yeah, well, Concorde was, and is still today, it no longer flies, of course.

152
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,379
It retired in October, 2003, but it was the only commercial aeroplane that flew supersonically.

153
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,559
So it would take off from Heathrow for New York about 11 o'clock in the morning, and

154
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,700
it would get to New York just after nine o'clock the same morning, two hours before, quote

155
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,019
unquote.

156
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,519
And a standard commercial flight is taking how long from Heathrow?

157
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,360
It'd take about seven hours.

158
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,019
Concorde took less than half that.

159
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,879
So it would take off, go due west, and it couldn't go supersonically

160
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,139
to London.

161
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,519
So it went over the sea because of the sonic boom.

162
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,779
So it would get out over the Irish Sea, and the skipper would stick the throttles forward,

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,100
and it would crank pretty quickly up to twice the speed of sound.

164
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,220
What experience was that like flying in it?

165
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,100
It was a remarkable aeroplane, obviously.

166
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,399
And the men and women who operated and maintained it were fantastic with it, because it was

167
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,519
so different to every other aeroplane.

168
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,000
It was tiny.

169
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,139
It was a bullet, basically.

170
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,440
So it was tiny.

171
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,139
How many seats?

172
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,600
100 seats, 25 rows, two on each side of the aisle.

173
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:16,139
And as it left Heathrow and headed to JFK Airport in New York, as it burnt fuel, it

174
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:16,639
would climb.

175
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,179
Most commercial aeroplanes maybe get up to 39,000 feet.

176
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,679
This aeroplane would get to 60,000 feet.

177
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,139
The sky wasn't blue, it was indigo.

178
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,700
And the horizon wasn't flat, it was curved.

179
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
So you could see the curvature of the earth in the car.

180
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,759
You could see the curvature of the earth.

181
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:32,940
Wow.

182
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,059
Yeah.

183
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:33,440
Yeah.

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,500
It was a remarkable aeroplane, and it was a smooth flight.

185
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,740
It was a privilege to fly it, and privilege to know the men and women who operated it.

186
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,440
And I still see some of them when I go to the UK.

187
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,860
Captain Mike Bannister, who was the fleet captain when we retired it in 2003, still

188
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
going strong.

189
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,200
And although the aeroplane's retired, I think the simulator's still there, and Mike flies

190
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,700
the simulator from time to time, he tells me.

191
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,220
So was it just not commercial?

192
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,980
Was it as simple as that?

193
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Yes.

194
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,860
It was an extraordinary aeroplane.

195
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:14,919
But for a manufacturer of aeroplanes to have a program that's commercially viable, a new

196
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:21,200
aeroplane type, a 777 or an Airbus A350, Boeing and Airbus, the two big manufacturers, you

197
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,879
normally need to make and sell about 1,000 before you get your development costs back.

198
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,480
They made it and sold less than 20 Concords.

199
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,860
It was at the heart of British Airways.

200
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,080
But the aeroplane itself was never able to sort of get the broad coverage it would need

201
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,679
to be a commercial success for the manufacturers.

202
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,039
Is there a place again for supersonic flight in the future?

203
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,679
I hope so.

204
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,320
It's going to take a while.

205
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,379
You've got to resolve two problems.

206
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,259
The first is the sonic boom, because most countries won't let you fly supersonically

207
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,080
over land because of the sonic boom.

208
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,740
So tell me if a sonic boom over land, you're breaking glass and...

209
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
Yeah.

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
You're probably...

211
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
It's bang, bang.

212
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,779
You hear the shock waves that come off the aeroplane sort of come down to the ground.

213
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,059
So you hear it quite clearly.

214
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,620
But the other thing, Luke, is that it was twice the speed of sound, which is where it

215
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,960
flew, is an inefficient speed to fly at.

216
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,019
So it burnt as much fuel going from London to New York as a 747 and carried about a quarter

217
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,740
the number of passengers.

218
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,360
So the two issues you need to resolve.

219
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,360
You need to find a way to diminish the sonic boom and you need for it to happen efficiently.

220
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,340
It was designed and built before the first oil shock.

221
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,980
So fuel was very cheap when it was designed and built.

222
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,399
So I hope there'll be a replacement and there's quite a bit of work going on at the moment,

223
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,840
trying to find a way to make supersonic travel viable again.

224
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,679
You spent more than 20 years on Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation board and locally on the

225
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,360
Herald and Weekly Times board.

226
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,519
And you've got an incredibly unique position of understanding global mainstream media.

227
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,720
My perception, Rod, is that it feels like we've never been more divided around the globe

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,580
and that even understanding truth, this concept of fake news now is something that is real.

229
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,860
We saw an assassination attempt days ago of the US president and half the people don't

230
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,940
think that's real.

231
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
What's the answer?

232
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
What do you make of it?

233
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,340
It feels that it's never been more hostile.

234
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,840
What do you think in terms of mainstream media's role in all that?

235
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
How do we fix that?

236
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,220
Well, I think the search for the truth is always the most important piece of the jigsaw.

237
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,860
And I think that's something that's always driven Rupert and Lachlan, who now runs the

238
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,820
business day to day.

239
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,320
Having grown up through science and engineering, the pursuit of the facts have always been

240
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,460
at the heart of scientific endeavor, engineering endeavor.

241
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,320
And too often you have your facts and I have mine, and we're not prepared to debate in

242
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,519
a Socratic way.

243
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,320
Yeah.

244
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,679
I think the evidence, where does it come from?

245
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,039
Is it viable?

246
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,460
Is it relevant?

247
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,799
People confuse opinions with facts.

248
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,380
And of course, we're all entitled to our own opinions, but we should at least be able to

249
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,799
agree on the facts.

250
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,119
And fake news is a real problem.

251
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,079
And my understanding was that that was journalism, was that you report on the facts.

252
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Correct.

253
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,480
And you let the viewer have an opinion and form that opinion.

254
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Correct.

255
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,180
And I think, and I do this from time to time, a story can come out in the US and you can

256
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
put CNN on.

257
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Yes.

258
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
You could put Fox News on.

259
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
And you could be living in two separate places.

260
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,980
You could be living in two separate planets on what is being reported factually.

261
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,700
That to me seems, and then what's happening is that that feels like that's dividing people.

262
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,059
As you said, we're not coming together then to try and find solutions.

263
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,059
Yeah.

264
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,940
But I think good journalists pursue the facts still today.

265
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Yeah.

266
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,160
They follow up.

267
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,099
If you have a, and sort of jobs I've done over the years, you find yourself talking

268
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,160
to journalists or not, and the good ones, and there are many good ones come well prepared

269
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,700
and they'll follow up on things you say.

270
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Yeah.

271
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,700
So be clear about your facts if you don't know say so.

272
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,599
I think journalism is about a facts-based activity.

273
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:14,220
That doesn't mean that you can't have commentary alongside the facts.

274
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,299
Commentary's a view about how I see the world.

275
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,480
And as long as you're clear about what is a story and what are the facts and what is

276
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,700
commentary, my interpretation of where we are, I think good journalists understand the

277
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,579
difference massively between the two.

278
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:29,579
Yeah.

279
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:34,759
And today I think we confuse opinions with facts and that skews the way in which we

280
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,759
view the world.

281
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:42,119
And Rob, big tech has come in, Facebook and Meta, 135 billion US dollars a year out of

282
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,000
the advertising market now heads towards the Mark Zuckerberg entity.

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,859
We know those algorithms work in ways that have made mainstream media poised in a delicate

284
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:53,859
space.

285
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,700
You'd have to say, free-to-air television and newspaper journalism is, as you would

286
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,579
know, much better than me.

287
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,759
A challenging space forever.

288
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,200
What do you think about big tech's role?

289
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,460
We know unavoidably the evidence is saying that those algorithms are doing huge harm

290
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,640
to our kids.

291
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
We talk a lot about what social media has done in that space.

292
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
What's your view on that?

293
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It's a real challenge.

294
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,859
I grew up in a much simpler world.

295
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:18,859
So did you.

296
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,720
You know, I grew up in a world in the bush in Western Australia before television.

297
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,759
So you listen to the radio and you read the newspapers and it was, the facts were the

298
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,000
facts and it was pretty clear.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,940
It's a much more complicated world now.

300
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,759
Of course, it's a world of greater opportunity.

301
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,259
As we sit here, it's the 60th anniversary of the Australian newspaper.

302
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,140
And I read The Australian and The Fin Review every day and The Herald and The Weekly Times

303
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
obviously too.

304
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,180
You know, I think there's still a real place for good journalism, facts-based focus on

305
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,960
what really happened.

306
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,980
There is commentary around that, but I think our kids live in a much more complicated world.

307
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
And we still don't fully understand.

308
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,140
We don't fully understand the impact of social media on young lives.

309
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,400
We know it's an opportunity for kids, gives them access to a much broader range of views,

310
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,420
but it's also a challenge because they have to sort out fact from fiction.

311
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,019
And that's increasingly difficult for the reasons you've said.

312
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,660
Another one of your great legacies I wanted to ask you about, Infrastructure Australia

313
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
in 2008.

314
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
You created that.

315
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
You're the inaugural chairman.

316
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,980
I assume that was about priorities.

317
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,259
It was around privatising these billion dollar projects and saying, we need to keep them

318
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,700
separate from politics.

319
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,740
Correct me if I'm wrong on that, you know, bipartisan support for that amount of money

320
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
to be spent.

321
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,819
Would make sense to have a committee and it's, it's a great concept.

322
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:43,819
I can't help it.

323
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:47,960
In a city here in Melbourne, you know, the East-West Project was one that you wrote a

324
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,980
paper on, and we saw that contract torn up to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.

325
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
We've got a suburban rail project.

326
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,940
That could be a hundred billion dollar project.

327
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,240
at least that hasn't gone through the normal channels. What do you think in the city of

328
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,200
Melbourne, with your experience, what does that bring up for you?

329
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:13,579
So Infrastructure Australia was set up in 2008 and Anthony Albanese, the current Prime Minister,

330
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,240
was Infrastructure Minister. We set up Infrastructure Australia to take an evidence-based

331
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,660
approach to infrastructure projects because everybody's got their pet projects. The challenge

332
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:32,319
is to look at what problem they're solving and can they do it efficiently and is that the best

333
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,819
use of the money. If you don't have some discipline around that, you can end up building

334
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:45,180
infrastructure that has limited value. I describe it as building bridges over puddles and roads to

335
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,579
nowhere. The whole idea of Infrastructure Australia was to take the projects that were put forward

336
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,319
at both federal and state level and evaluate them.

337
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,640
Now,

338
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,579
not just in economic terms, cost-benefit analysis is something that's been around for a while,

339
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,339
but also look at the impact that projects have on the environment and community

340
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:13,099
and then publish a list of projects that we believe to be viable and sensible and appropriate

341
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:18,859
so that political leaders, when they come to choose projects, can do so

342
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:25,640
from a list of sensible projects. What often happens is that politicians,

343
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:33,480
like other folks, have their own pet projects and they often are keen to pursue them without,

344
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,220
I think, the necessary rigour into them. And we've seen examples of that all around the country.

345
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,400
We've seen some good projects, projects that make a real difference. The East-West report that I did

346
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,900
in 2008, which Steve Brax was Premier when we started that project, and when I delivered the

347
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,640
report, John Brumby was Premier. And the East-West report that I did in 2008, which Steve Brax was

348
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,660
Premier when we started that project, and when I delivered the report, John Brumby was Premier. And the East-West report that I did in 2008,

349
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,779
and when I delivered the report, John Brumby was Premier. And the East-West report that I did in 2008,

350
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:01,539
there were a series of recommendations in that. There were three really big projects.

351
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,539
Two of them were rail projects, improved connectivity to Ballarat, Geelong and Bendigo from Melbourne,

352
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,500
the beginning of an urban rail network in Melbourne, the Underground.

353
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,859
Both those things have either happened or are happening. And then the tunnel that would have

354
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:25,299
linked the Eastern Freeway with the Tullamarine in the Westgate, which was torn up at a minute to midnight.

355
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:31,140
At a cost of a billion dollars. My own view has been and remains that one day that'll have to be

356
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,339
built because it'll take all that traffic that runs through the north of the city,

357
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,640
underground, like the Burnley and Domain tunnels, take the traffic south of the city underground

358
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,539
and improve the livability. My view, Luke, about those things is that's an advisory role.

359
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:54,940
Advisors advise and governments decide, right? And sometimes they decide wisely. And in my view,

360
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:03,440
sometimes they don't. But you have to, no one elected me to office. I was asked to make a

361
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,759
contribution to the policy debate. I've always been happy to contribute to policy, try and stay

362
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,160
out of the politics, but contribute to policy. But government has to make the right calls and

363
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,740
we see it all around the country. And sometimes in my view, they choose wisely and sometimes they

364
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,779
don't. A very pragmatic approach. And I appreciate that.

365
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,579
And it makes a lot of sense. But I think people with your wisdom and experience and business

366
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:36,779
history have a voice. And Generation Young, it feels like we, and I'm going to be a bit local

367
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,779
here in Victoria. I'm fascinated. We're approaching $200 billion worth of debt as a state.

368
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,299
That's it.

369
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,299
Feels like we've got some unique problems coming our way.

370
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,839
Yes.

371
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,200
Do we need people like you to be out there beating the drum a bit? Is that a concern? I mean,

372
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
should we be concerned about that level of debt?

373
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,680
You should be concerned.

374
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah.

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
I think $200 million.

376
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,240
$200 billion.

377
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,920
$200 billion.

378
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,960
$200 billion is a lot of money and that's where we're headed. And we're going to get there quite

379
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,299
quickly.

380
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,740
$26 million a day of interest we pay.

381
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,519
That's it. And if, heaven forbid, we were to lose our credit rating, then the interest bill would

382
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:19,000
go up. So it's a real issue. And you need to use bodies like Infrastructure Australia and

383
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,799
Infrastructure Victoria, because there's a state body. And some of the big projects,

384
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,619
they've never been near either of those bodies. And that's a real concern. Because if they're

385
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,740
good projects, then they'll pass muster. And you shouldn't push them through on the fly,

386
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:41,299
in my view. Because at the end of the day, governments have decisions to make about what

387
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,160
they spend on infrastructure. We've talked about some of that. But on hospitals, on education,

388
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,559
on the police force, on all the things that make our community and our society function

389
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,359
properly. And money spent often in one area means there's less money to be spent in another.

390
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,220
So you need to be very disciplined about where you spend and how you spend it. Because if not,

391
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,960
then your children and your grandchildren end up paying the bill.

392
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,319
And you've been another great champion for major events. And the benefit of that bringing

393
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:20,799
the Grand Prix and the Australian Open Tennis and these projects that make a state like Victoria

394
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,259
what it is. Can you tell us about why that's been so important for you?

395
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,359
So I did that. Steve Brax, when he was Premier, asked me to take it over,

396
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:37,759
which I did at the end of 2005, beginning of 2006. Ron Walker had really worked so hard to

397
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,099
make it work with Geoff Kennett. And I stood on their shoulders, really. And I did it for

398
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:48,940
a dozen or so years and loved it. In part because it's Melbourne's and Victoria's sweet spot.

399
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,539
We don't have iron ore. We don't have coal. We're not like Queensland and Western Australia.

400
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,160
Where there are large revenue streams that come from the resource industry.

401
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:07,259
And for Melbourne, particularly with the great facilities, we've got the MCG, the Rod Laver Arena,

402
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:15,359
Amy Stadium now, National Gallery of Victoria, the museum, the state library. We've got great

403
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,980
venues that are very centrally located. And Victoria, and remember it was initially called

404
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,539
Melbourne Major Events by the time I got there.

405
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,000
It was Victoria Major Events. So it wasn't just Melbourne. But Melbourne is blessed with

406
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,079
infrastructure that's been built over a long period of time. So we've got the venues to

407
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:42,279
host these things. And we have the people who know how to make it work. So you can go to a

408
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:48,680
football game or rugby game or a cricket game at the MCG. And you can be there with close to

409
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,480
100,000 people. You can arrive by tram. You can walk from the CBD. You can,

410
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,059
catch the train. And 30 minutes after the game finishes, the place is empty.

411
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,640
Now, there are not many places in the world where that's true. So we have the venues,

412
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:10,079
we have the people. And over a long period of time, Victoria built a reputation for being

413
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,200
not only the sporting capital of the world, but the events capital of the world.

414
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,700
And we've got to keep that.

415
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,839
It's a great way to describe it, isn't it? You take that for granted, don't you? 100,000 people

416
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,759
enter the MCG and within 30 minutes, you're in a restaurant in the city or you've gone home on the

417
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,079
train.

418
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,500
Absolutely.

419
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,759
It is unique, isn't it, to other cities in the world and something we should celebrate. I love,

420
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm fascinated by your story. So many passions and different streams. And I mentioned in the

421
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,799
introduction, Sir Rod, your commendation, the highest civil commendation you can get from the

422
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,140
Japanese government, which is a great legacy. And you've been a huge champion of Asia-Australian

423
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,380
relationships and the business connection in that. Tell us why that was so important to you.

424
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,779
Well, Australia's three major trading partners, Luke,

425
00:28:53,779 --> 00:29:01,259
China, Japan, and Korea in that order, South Korea. And although we are culturally sort of

426
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:06,440
halfway between here and London, I would describe us, something like a third of Australians weren't

427
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,460
born in Australia. You know, in my household, I'm the only one who was born here. My wife's

428
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,640
Korean. Our two children were born in Hong Kong. So Australia is a really sort of wonderful

429
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,839
polyglot place in many ways. But our culture still owes a lot to the Western civilization,

430
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:30,039
as well as indigenous civilization. But our economy is firmly part of Asia. Our biggest trading

431
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,460
partners are in Asia. And in talking about China, Japan, and Korea, let's not forget ASEAN too,

432
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:43,039
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines. So our economic well-being is very dependent upon

433
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,019
our Asian links. And I worked in Asia for 20 years, Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong,

434
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,680
and learned so much doing it. But our focus,

435
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:59,440
on Asia, is so important to us. And I think we often forget how important those Asia links are.

436
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,140
So I'm always keen to remind people that we depend on the well-being of our Asian neighbors,

437
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,059
and we should make the most of the relationship. Do you think Australians understand that?

438
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,700
No, I think they're beginning to. I think it was Paul Keating who said many years ago that

439
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:21,000
the closest most people get to Indonesia is they fly over the top of it on their way to Hong Kong

440
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,819
or Singapore or whatever, which is true.

441
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,660
I think we're beginning to understand how important Asia is. For me, the understanding

442
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,880
came as a student at University of Western Australia, because there were students who

443
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,279
came from South Asia particularly under something called the Colombo Plan, and the Australian

444
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:48,900
government paid for their education here. So in my class were young men and women from Malaysia,

445
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,759
from Singapore, from Indonesia, who came to study here.

446
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,079
Many of whom became lifelong friends of Australia. And many years later, when I would go to Asia on

447
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:04,480
business when I worked there, I'd bump into people who had been to University of Western Australia.

448
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,799
I mean, those links are very important. Hi, I love asking these series of questions,

449
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:15,759
and I'm fascinated by your take on it. I write on what different leadership looks like in different

450
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:22,200
settings. And your story is a fascinating and unique one. And we feel like the ability to lead

451
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
someone else means you've got to have an understanding of yourself. And we talk about

452
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,700
this idea of self-leadership before you lead someone else. Does that ring true to you, the

453
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,539
idea of self-leadership? Yes, you have to understand yourself,

454
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,680
but you also have to understand them. That's why it's important to ask questions. Because when you

455
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,880
ask questions of people, you begin to understand them as well as the issues. But I think leaders

456
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,240
need to be comfortable in their own skin in many ways. And for someone like me,

457
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:59,400
that came from sport as well as the classroom. You know, I think I learned more about leadership

458
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,059
on the sporting field than I did in the classroom, probably. And I think I'm not unusual in that

459
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:11,880
sense. So the other thing you have to, if you're going to lead in a business sense or in a sporting

460
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,359
sense, you better really understand the industry or the game you're involved in. I think the best

461
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,220
leaders are passionate about leadership. And I think that's one of the things that I've learned

462
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,319
about the business they're in or the sport they're in or the business of sport. They're

463
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,880
passionate about it. They think about it in the shower in the morning. They don't sort of pick it

464
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,859
up at nine o'clock and put it down at five. And they're constantly curious about understanding

465
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:43,140
the new things that are coming in. So, you know, aviation when I retired was very different to

466
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,480
aviation when I joined. Technology had changed, aeroplanes had changed, but the way in which we

467
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,960
did it remarkably, you know, we'd gone from people booking a flight on the telephone to doing it

468
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,900
online. I mean, there were, it was constantly changing and you've got to stay abreast of those

469
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,220
changes. Yeah. I loved your four questions before when you were at British Airways, you know, what

470
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,660
do you like about the organisation? What would you like to change? You know, what's broken and

471
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,019
how would you fix it? They're simple questions, aren't they? But you learn a lot. Well, you learn

472
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:20,819
about how people see your business, but you also learn about them and you get some great insights.

473
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,740
You know, if you want to know about an airline, go talk to the people who touch the customers

474
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,900
every day. You know, as chief executive, I sat in an office, I was often out and about in the

475
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,880
business. But if you talk to someone at the check-in counter or a pilot or a cabin crew member

476
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,880
who deal with customers day in, day out, not in ones and twos, but in hundreds, their insights

477
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,240
into what works and what doesn't, it's very, very, very useful. It's a great point and often

478
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,220
overlooked in the television industry. Not many people ask that question. I mean,

479
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,220
it's the cameramen who know everything. Correct.

480
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,500
And sit there and understand the industry maybe better than anyone else, but often rarely asked.

481
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,059
We see leaders who have great success like you, Rod, are really conscious of the impact they have

482
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:08,539
on others in a positive way every day. I understand you go back to London and the British Airways,

483
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,380
people that work with you, there's many friends and you catch up with lots of people. Were you

484
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,340
conscious of that, that positive impact you had on other people in your environment?

485
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,219
Well, you try and do the best job you can do.

486
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,880
That's the first thing you do. But in a complicated industry like aviation,

487
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:32,239
which is technology and marketing and sales, customer service, logistics, by definition,

488
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,760
you need a team of people. You're a big employer, so human resources are really important. Employing

489
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,739
good people and helping them grows important. So you can't run a business like that yourself,

490
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:51,159
by yourself. You've got to do it with a team of really good people who've got some real

491
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,179
clients. You've got to do it with a team of really good people who've got some real

492
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:51,219
clients. You've got to do it with a team of really good people who've got some real

493
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:58,519
clarity about what needs to be done and feel they can work together to do it. So I always took

494
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:08,019
the view that my job in the leadership sense was to create that sort of environment. And when you

495
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:13,920
do that and you work with people and you see people grow and improve, because we all have

496
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,159
speed bumps at different times in our lives, you get a kick out of seeing their success.

497
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,159
So I get a kick out of seeing

498
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:27,079
Cathay Pacific, British Airways, the two airlines where I spent most of my working life,

499
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:32,340
seeing people today who are running those businesses, who were there in a much more

500
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,579
junior capacity when I was there. And I get a kick out of that. And I like to,

501
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,760
from time to time, I bump into them and I like to celebrate their journey with them.

502
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,440
I get a kick out of that too.

503
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,719
You mentioned the clarity and the idea of coming in with a vision and being able to

504
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,840
share that with your team. How do you do that?

505
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,940
How did you do that? I'm assuming you came in with, once you worked out the path,

506
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:59,440
you've got to then be able to get, as you said, that team on board. How did you go about sharing

507
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,860
that vision?

508
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,320
Well, it's got to be a shared vision, Luke. You can't be something that you carve in tablets

509
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,639
of stone by yourself and sort of arrive to your team and say, Eureka, here it is.

510
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:17,480
I think you work out the path. You have your own views. And if you've got a good team around you,

511
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,780
those views can be crystallized and the best parts of them take,

512
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,519
going forward. But unless there's shared ownership about the journey,

513
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,360
and that's true all the way down the business. So one of the roles I think good chief executives

514
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,260
take upon themselves is they're not only the chief executive officer, but they've also got

515
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,280
to be the chief communications officer. You've got to be able to talk to people

516
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,519
anywhere in your business about where the business is headed and why. And you've also

517
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,500
got to understand how the work that they do day to day contributes to that success.

518
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:58,920
And once people can see what they do day to day and how that helps the business be successful,

519
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,900
that's really energizing for them. They see a focus. They understand what they can do

520
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,820
and how they can make things better. That's very powerful.

521
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,480
We see curiosity as a word that comes up a lot for different leaders who have sustained success.

522
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,820
And you sat down and I said, we looked back and you said, no, I'm happy to be here. And I've,

523
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,380
can't wait for today. And it sounds like you've got that curiosity. Does that ring true for you?

524
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,420
Oh, absolutely. I was asked a couple of years ago in my office in JP Morgan here in Melbourne,

525
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:39,199
what I fear losing most. And I think they thought I'd probably say hearing or sight or whatever. I

526
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:45,219
said the gift of curiosity. I think curiosity is a really important piece to be genuinely curious

527
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:50,719
and to know that every day you're going to learn something new, um, is really,

528
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,579
really powerful and very motivating. So just when you think, you know, the answer to a problem,

529
00:37:56,059 --> 00:38:01,579
the problem changes. And if you think I know the answer to that problem, because I worked it out

530
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:07,019
a year ago or a week ago or a day ago, you've got to be open to the idea that the nature of the

531
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,400
problem may have changed and you better rethink what the solution is.

532
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,699
Well, how important is collaboration been for you in all of your different endeavors?

533
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,820
Well, collaboration matters because, um, I mean, clearly it does in sport,

534
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,960
but it matters in business too. So if you are in the airline business, then you're buying

535
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,699
airplanes from Boeing and Airbus. You're buying engines from Rolls Royce and General Electric.

536
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:39,039
You're buying wine, wine glasses, seats, galleys. You're buying computer systems, software.

537
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,860
You know, you don't make any of these things yourself. You're constantly buying.

538
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,820
And in today's world, if you are buying, you have to collaborate. And, um, a good example of

539
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,820
that for me was Boeing, who have got their challenges at the moment. But if you go back

540
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:04,519
to the Boeing 777 program, which was sort of early nineties, um, the project manager was a guy called

541
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:11,539
Alan Mullally. And Alan went on to be sort of head of commercial at Boeing and then effectively

542
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:18,360
rebuilt Ford Motor Car Company. Terrific guy. But Alan did something that Boeing hadn't done before.

543
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:20,139
Before they,

544
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,400
settled on the design of the Boeing 777. In the nineties, he got half a dozen of his best

545
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,900
customers together and said, what are you looking for? You know, what sort of airplane,

546
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,940
what sort of characteristics, what's, what are you looking for on the maintenance front?

547
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,579
So he looked at all the elements of, that airlines would think about before they buy airplanes.

548
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,940
And he worked with his customers. Cathay Pacific was one, British Airways was another.

549
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,800
I think United was one.

550
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,360
Japan Airlines. These were big buyers of Boeing airplanes. They operated wide-bodied airplanes.

551
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,219
Um, and they knew the good things and the not so good things about, about airplanes.

552
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:08,019
And Alan, instead of building an airplane and then selling it, decided to get customers on board on day one.

553
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,840
And that's been an extremely successful program for Boeing, the 777 program.

554
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,400
And that's a good example of collaboration.

555
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,539
And did you find you actually bringing competitors together too, as customers?

556
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:20,760
Yeah.

557
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,880
And the idea that that opportunity is there, obviously there's anti-competitive issues,

558
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,659
but when there is common interest and safety into something like an airline industry, did you,

559
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:32,659
did competitors find that was a reasonable thing to do?

560
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah. So there are clearly some things you can't talk about because it's anti-competitive behavior,

561
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,960
but everyone in aviation has an interest in safety. So you want Boeing to build the

562
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,519
safest airplanes possible. You also have a joint vested interest in, um, having an airplane that's

563
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,519
easy to maintain.

564
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,460
Where are the access panels? Where's the technology? How easy is it to maintain that?

565
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,719
And that's something that's not an issue of competition between airlines.

566
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,360
You wouldn't talk about things that were competition.

567
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,619
We never got into seats. Boeing don't make seats anyway.

568
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,519
Separate companies make the seats.

569
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:13,719
There are some areas where the airlines work together quite properly and quite legitimately.

570
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:18,079
And it was about sharing those thoughts, that thinking.

571
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,800
So Rod, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

572
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,699
Lots of them. Mum and dad, probably. You grow up at your parents' knee. They sort of shape you,

573
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,739
really. And I was lucky. I love both my parents. Um, and then along the way, sporting people who

574
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,340
my captain's coach, we talked about two of them, Rod Marsh and John Inverarity. Um,

575
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,820
when I played football at university, it was a guy called Peter Tannick, who was captain coach,

576
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,760
who played for East Perth and who was tough. It was terrific. Um, and then there were people in

577
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,400
the classroom, people who inspire you. And I was always science focused, some great teachers at

578
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,280
school and some good teachers at university. So those sorts of people inspire you on your journey

579
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,019
and they really shape you. I think later in life, you, you meet other people who, who, um, who you

580
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:16,960
admire, but, um, it's the earlier, earliest part of the journey that determines who you are.

581
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,179
And for me, it was those sorts of people.

582
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,579
Okay.

583
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,559
And then of course, particularly doing the aviation job, you get to meet interesting

584
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,159
people and some of those inspire you too.

585
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,880
It's a great answer, Rod.

586
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,599
And it's such a diverse life that you've had.

587
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,800
And my final question too, we are a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration and you've,

588
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,579
as you said, from Rupert Murdoch to a whole range of fascinating people.

589
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,820
We could spend another four hours.

590
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,079
I'd like to do that on the different people.

591
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,559
But in terms of collaborating into a project or you thought, God, I'd love to collaborate

592
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,880
with that particular person.

593
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,900
It might be an interest of sporting or any of your other passions.

594
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,420
Is there someone that you've been curious to collaborate with?

595
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,079
Well, I think serving on boards, you get to see a broad church.

596
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:10,420
And for me in a business sense, I think Rupert Murdoch is the most outstanding business leader

597
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,980
I've met.

598
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:18,380
Someone who could turn a single newspaper in Adelaide into a global media empire.

599
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,539
And, you know.

600
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:29,400
You know, in his early 90s, still clear thinking and fascinated by future opportunity.

601
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,559
And we grew up with printers ink in his veins, really, which he got from his father, who's

602
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,219
Sir Keith Murdoch, who was also a journalist and a newspaper proprietor.

603
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,519
But Rupert was able to move without giving up on newspapers, quite the opposite.

604
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,940
He's still a champion of them, was able to move into the electronic business system,

605
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
to television.

606
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,380
He's still a champion of television, to movies, and is still fascinated by new opportunities.

607
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:04,159
So being able to sit and be part of the conversations and what those sorts of people do, one of

608
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,239
the things it tells me, if Rupert can still be going at 93, mind you, he's got pretty

609
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:08,800
good genes.

610
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,599
His mother, who was a saint, lived to be well over 100.

611
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,559
Then there's hope for you and me, Luke.

612
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,820
We can keep going too.

613
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,420
Is it a misunderstood story?

614
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,420
People think that Rupert inherited the keys to the world.

615
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,800
But he literally got left the Adelaide newspaper, and the most successful media business ever

616
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,940
in history, arguably one of the most successful people ever on the planet, comes with, when

617
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,119
you're in that industry, your fair share of critics, and obviously people would understand

618
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:38,559
that.

619
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,619
But you've been up close and personal to see, and even in early 90s, what's next?

620
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,400
And that curiosity.

621
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,400
The business nearly collapsed in the early 90s when there was an economic downturn.

622
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,239
Rupert came through it and was rebuilt stronger and better than ever.

623
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,300
We talked earlier about the importance of facts, right?

624
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,039
Rupert's always been passionate about getting to the bottom of stuff, the facts.

625
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:04,719
What are the facts?

626
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,880
And he's always had a, you know, in a business sense, a capacity to look beyond the here

627
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,380
and now.

628
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,539
So to look at the iPad when it first popped up, instead of thinking, this may be the best

629
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,619
means of death of newspapers, thinking here's yet another way to get great content to

630
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:31,260
customers, including customers who probably don't currently read newspapers, and that

631
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,840
capacity to look beyond the here and now, and to be relentlessly curious, to find new

632
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,440
ways of doing things, and not to be a prisoner of the past.

633
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,659
That takes some doing.

634
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:49,659
And in order to be successful, you just have to keep looking forward.

635
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,219
You can't spend too much time looking in the rear vision mirror, Luke.

636
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:58,300
You mentioned as a CEO, you're the chief communication officer at the same time.

637
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,139
Can you give us a little bit on that?

638
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,480
How did you communicate?

639
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,739
How do you still go about communicating with a range of different people?

640
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,880
Well, I think when you're in a leadership position in the business, there are formal

641
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,159
channels of communication.

642
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:19,300
You know, businesses today have newsletters, newspapers, videos, podcasts to talk to their

643
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,619
people.

644
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,679
Which is really important.

645
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,960
But of course, if you're the CEO and you're talking to the press about, you know, and

646
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,460
if you're in a public company, as British Airways was, Cathay was too, Cathay Pacific

647
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:40,000
was too, then interim results, full year results, you're in front of the media as well as the

648
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,440
analysts.

649
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:48,559
And the people who, in my experience, who read with the greatest interest what the newspapers

650
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:49,559
and televisions focus on.

651
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,940
And you see what those folks have to say are your own stuff, your shareholders too, obviously,

652
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,000
but your own stuff.

653
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,380
And there's got to be real consistency in messages.

654
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,380
It's got to be true.

655
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,900
But if they read something in the newspapers that's different to what they hear from you

656
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,360
directly, then your credibility evaporates quite quickly.

657
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,900
So whenever you're communicating, you have to be clear about what the narrative is and

658
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,079
it's got to be consistent.

659
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:18,260
So, Rod Eddy, it's been a great pleasure to spend some time with you.

660
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,099
