00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,320
Stacey Moorlank-Sullivan is an Australian lacrosse legend.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,519
She graduated from Loyola University, Maryland in 2002,

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,179
based in Baltimore in the United States as a three-time All-American

5
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:21,859
and still holds the NCAA Division I record for the most goals in a game,

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,800
which, by the way, was 12 versus American in her senior season.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,019
She's a business owner, the co-founder of Show & Tell Online,

8
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,100
a women's lifestyle brand, co-host of her own brilliant podcast

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,880
of the same name, Show & Tell Online, with her great friends Monty and Mel.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,320
She's married to Mike Sullivan himself, by the way, an All-American lacrosse player.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,140
They have three young boys, Raph, Jarvie and Mac.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Stacey came out of retirement to represent Australia at her fourth World Cup

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,640
as a mother of three, having previously won a World Cup gold medal in 2005

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,359
and twice been captain of Australia.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,719
In recent times, Stacey has joined our team at Alita

16
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,840
as a brilliant leadership facilitator in our signature Alita Connect program.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,079
Stacey.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,540
Stacey, I look at you and I think you're a bit of a freak of nature for me.

19
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,019
Mother of three, business owner, I mentioned it all there,

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,840
come out of retirement to play for Australia.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,200
Most people, when you do it all with good humour and great care for people,

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,239
how do you do it all?

23
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,980
Oh, God, that's a million-dollar question, isn't it, Darce?

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,879
And thanks for having me.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,819
I'm excited to chat with you.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,500
We're never short of a word, are we?

27
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,560
But how do we do it all?

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,379
I get asked that quite a lot, actually,

29
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,659
and it's that ever-elusive question of balance.

30
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,099
And the answer is there is no real answer.

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,560
I just know that I'm better when I'm busy

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,099
and I'm a more effective mother and person

33
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,719
and happier when I've got a bit of purpose.

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,900
And then I'm working towards something.

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,060
So I kind of live in a constant state of that,

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,379
even though sometimes I wish I didn't.

37
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,420
Most of the time I'm better off there.

38
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,500
So you need to have that real sense of achievement and purpose.

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,620
And even if it means there's a lot going on,

40
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,280
because I think anyone would appreciate what I just said.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,060
To manage all that takes enormous skill,

42
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,620
but you know yourself well enough to think,

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,180
unless that's going, I'm not going to be the best version of myself.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,460
Is that right?

45
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,319
Yeah, absolutely.

46
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,460
And I think it's when you're used to achieving,

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,159
I think it becomes quite addictive in a way,

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,000
which is not necessarily a good thing.

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,080
But I think once you know that you're capable of doing hard things,

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,259
nothing's too daunting.

51
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:31,000
So then I became quite relentless in always trying to learn

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,439
and push the boundaries and achieve.

53
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:32,460
Yeah.

54
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,479
Yeah.

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,520
Yeah.

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Yeah.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,580
Yeah.

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,599
Yeah.

59
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:32,620
Yeah.

60
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:32,639
Yeah.

61
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:32,680
Yeah.

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,699
Yeah.

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:32,719
Yeah.

64
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,520
Something different than what I was used to.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,860
But I think I am better in that space.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,860
I am more productive, more helpful for other people

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,280
and happier in myself if I am always on the pathway to something.

68
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah.

69
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:47,460
Yeah.

70
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,780
I've seen that with you and I'll come back and talk about this

71
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,800
in a bit more detail later.

72
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,180
But, you know, taking on something new and a challenge

73
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,460
and just to see your focus, but also just your capacity to learn

74
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,639
and want to keep self-improving is incredibly impressive to watch.

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,539
So I'll come back and talk about that in the context of the work at a leader.

76
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,479
But, you know, reading your story in preparation, Stace, I know it,

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
but I'm reading it again.

78
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,280
I think 17 years of age, you grew up in Newport,

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
you get picked out to go on a US college scholarship, you know,

80
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,419
and you're captain of Australia at a really young age.

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,060
So, you know, I see the work you're doing as a leader now as a brilliant job.

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,180
Have you always seen yourself in a leadership role?

83
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,000
Because it seems as though that's been the whole context of your life.

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,120
Yeah.

85
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,039
It's an interesting question.

86
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,340
When I was mentally preparing for this chat today,

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,680
I thought about that, about how young I was,

88
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,580
finding myself in those positions.

89
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,800
And I think I just, I did naturally gravitate towards, you know,

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,539
it sounds cliche, but the wee before me,

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,360
I was quite young when that developed for me.

92
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,860
I think just from the type of parents I had, you know, I was 17,

93
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,439
I was 14 playing with the best players in Australia at my club.

94
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,479
And they knew the lingo.

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,419
They knew what it looked like because they were older.

96
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,000
Some of them were 35 or plus.

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,439
And I was in an environment all the time where that was expected.

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,860
It wasn't about you.

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,939
It was about everybody else.

100
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,939
How can you serve the group?

101
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,879
So I think I started quite young in that area.

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
And I obviously just grabbed onto it.

103
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,680
And I did have that innate ability to connect with people quite easily.

104
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,040
And I was very much aware of how I affected people.

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,759
Like as a young child, like my mum and dad said that too,

106
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,959
I had a lot of empathy and compassion.

107
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,360
But just knew how to weave my way through people to make everybody feel quite comfortable

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,060
and serve them in a way.

109
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,160
So I think from a young age, I probably was, it was pretty innate in a way.

110
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,339
But I did often find myself in those positions,

111
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,459
mostly because I think I could play at a high level and serve people at the same time.

112
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,279
Yeah, it's a brilliant way to describe it.

113
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,620
And I love the language you use there, Stace,

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,600
it feels like that's where we've crossed over in that sense of we,

115
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,740
you know, coming out of such an individualized world.

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,259
And people listening to this will hear me talk about that a lot,

117
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,959
that, you know, there's so much research now,

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,519
how hyper-individualized the world's got.

119
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,620
And that's what I loved about team sport.

120
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,060
That was the first, second, and third thing, more than anything else,

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,180
was you worked out really quickly that you're only going to be good

122
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,819
if your mate next to you was good.

123
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,459
You're only going to have success if you could influence others to have good success.

124
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,579
And that just happened, you know, as a parent,

125
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,100
whatever layer,

126
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
you want to, you know, overlay that is,

127
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,160
it's just a healthier, happier way, isn't it?

128
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,040
But you obviously got that at a really young age,

129
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,959
as you said, 14 or 15.

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,579
Yeah, really young.

131
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,779
I was really young.

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,240
And then my first experience as a captain was

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,560
the under-19 Australian team when I was 18.

134
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,879
Then at Loyola for a couple of seasons.

135
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,259
And then it just kind of kept going.

136
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,220
But I was also really comfortable being in a capacity like that without a title

137
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,120
and making sure that everyone was galvanized

138
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,420
and together and working towards something that was bigger than themselves.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,459
And not everyone gets that Tuesday.

140
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,040
So I'm playing team sport with you,

141
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,720
a smile on your face, isn't it?

142
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,100
And it takes all types.

143
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,560
And so you're not necessarily being judgmental there.

144
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,439
But, you know, certainly people I gravitated to were the ones that got that

145
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,720
and still do.

146
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,379
And I think that's part of that community you and I, you know, building.

147
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,720
And as I said, we'll talk about that, you know,

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,600
in a moment around that community of people that do look out for other people

149
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
is something that...

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,540
feel like the world needs if we're going to the high level.

151
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,319
You come out of retirement, your mother is free.

152
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,319
You've done it all at that stage.

153
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,740
I mean, there's not a lot to prove.

154
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,360
So what was going on there?

155
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,180
What made you want to come back and push yourself at this stage of your life?

156
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,300
Yeah, that's a good question.

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,379
There was a few things going on.

158
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,480
I think I was happily retired.

159
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,560
I had achieved everything I wanted to achieve.

160
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,019
And I retired in the first place because I remember that last World Cup I did.

161
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,819
I think I was 32.

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,100
I felt just a tiny bit.

163
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,040
I was off my top speed.

164
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,560
And it was really uncomfortable for me because I relied on it so heavily.

165
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,519
So as soon as I felt like I was 5% or 10% slower than I used to be,

166
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,240
I was like, I'm out.

167
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,220
Which in hindsight was a bit weak, I think,

168
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,300
because there was other things I had to offer.

169
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,420
But I was also really happily retired.

170
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,740
And I had one kid already on my last one.

171
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,259
And then my second one was rather challenging.

172
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,399
So he needed a lot more parenting than the first.

173
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,399
And then I think what happened was one of my...

174
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,779
One of the most important people in my life who was my mentor,

175
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,800
but also who I played with growing up,

176
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,920
who moved into coaching me probably for 80% of my career,

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,519
who passed away suddenly a couple of years ago.

178
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,360
She was the general manager of the last Australian team.

179
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,660
She came to me and said, we need you to try to come back.

180
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,600
And I said, well, look, you're going to have to be really clear about what this is

181
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
because this is an epic task for me.

182
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,519
She said, we just, we need...

183
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,639
Someone to come in and lead a young group

184
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,800
and try to show them what it takes so that we can build it for the future.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,980
And I had a specific skill set that they also needed,

186
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,060
which was senatorial possession technique and skill

187
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,459
that I had developed over years to create an edge that,

188
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,160
you know, made me indispensable in a way.

189
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,980
So there was a few things working there.

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,779
And then I said, look, I'll give it a go.

191
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,699
But if it doesn't work, though,

192
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
Merky, you'll switch over to the coaching side.

193
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,620
And I said, that's fine.

194
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,240
Totally fine.

195
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,539
So we started that process.

196
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,899
It was hectic.

197
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,259
It was eight years of not being at a high level.

198
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,500
Eight year gap, was it?

199
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,980
Eight year gap of international elite play.

200
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,440
Wow.

201
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,620
And my body didn't like it.

202
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,120
I mean, after three C-sections and just, you know, it was a mission.

203
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,340
And it was probably the most challenging World Cup I'd ever done,

204
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,279
mentally and physically.

205
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,919
I learned more about myself.

206
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,080
I learned more about myself in this process than any World Cup before it.

207
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,879
It was the relentlessness of training a completely different way

208
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,259
and asking my mind to do things that was really uncomfortable.

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,799
But I think the reason why I came back was to serve the sport.

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,220
I had genuinely given away the need to perform

211
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,980
and had surrendered to the fact that I was doing this for Australian lacrosse

212
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,080
and for the players that were coming after.

213
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,000
And it was a really interesting process

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,879
and incredibly empowering in some ways

215
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,700
and also felt really vulnerable through the process as well.

216
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,320
Getting to know you in recent times and having heard you tell that story,

217
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm not surprised by the person that you are,

218
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,580
that you would go and do that in such a selfless way.

219
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,440
And I can also relate to when you know what you like at your absolute best

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,039
and you lose, you know, people would say 5% of speed.

221
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,100
Why?

222
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,960
That's everything, isn't it?

223
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,299
At the top level, that's everything.

224
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,399
And that's the thing that made you obviously unbelievable at what you do.

225
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,399
So to get over that mental hurdle to say,

226
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,340
I'm going to come back but for a higher purpose

227
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,600
and knowing that you can still play clearly at the Australian level

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,279
but, you know, to overcome all that for a selfless purpose,

229
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,519
I think that probably sums you up.

230
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,580
And, you know, I mean, you won World Cup gold medals.

231
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,779
You've achieved how much enjoyment?

232
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,980
You look back to have gone, you know, you finished fourth in the World Cup in 2022.

233
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,480
You know, great achievement, great effort.

234
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,759
Do you look back with great satisfaction just because of what you went through?

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,679
Yeah, I look back with great satisfaction of it was the worst result I'd obviously had

236
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,320
and we've ever had in Australian women's lacrosse is fourth.

237
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,360
But I do look back on it in a very different way than the others.

238
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,659
I had a lot of support in the other World Cups with my peers

239
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:59,519
and some of the best players in the world at the time were playing in the same era as me.

240
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:00,740
So,

241
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,559
when I look back on this one, I think,

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,179
God, the challenge was so massive.

243
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,620
But like I said before,

244
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,159
I learned so much about myself that it was almost the most profound one for me,

245
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,559
even though the result wasn't what we wanted.

246
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,500
But I always do, you know,

247
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,279
one of the skills I have, I think,

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,419
in reflection for preparation for this too,

249
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,879
and just I've spent a lot of time trying to understand the difference between good and great

250
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,200
and what that space is in between.

251
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,700
And I think one of the things that I did have that lives in that space is,

252
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,779
is the ability to move through thoughts really quickly.

253
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, my friends joke about it all the time,

254
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,679
that they're my memory bank of every World Cup.

255
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,460
They'll say, oh my God, remember we did this?

256
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,419
And I'd say, I've got no idea.

257
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,320
I don't remember any of it.

258
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,659
But even in games, it would be seconds.

259
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,759
They'd be like, you've missed the same shot 10 times.

260
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,360
I don't remember.

261
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,379
I just go back and keep trying.

262
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,220
So, when I finish World Cups, regardless of the result,

263
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,299
any game I've ever had,

264
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,240
I do have the ability to switch off it.

265
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,500
Like, it hurts for a minute,

266
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
but then, because I work so hard,

267
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,379
prepare so hard,

268
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,519
do everything I can,

269
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,039
I am content with the fact that I'd done everything I could.

270
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,960
And I think that's the gift you've got to give yourself,

271
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,879
is losing shit, yeah.

272
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,879
No one wants to lose.

273
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,779
But I don't leave anything,

274
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,600
no stone unturned,

275
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,000
so that when it's over, it's over.

276
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,440
And then I need to let it go.

277
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,700
Such a great life lesson, that one, Stace, isn't it?

278
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,899
It just takes the air out of all the pressure of sport, doesn't it?

279
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,340
To say, if you compete,

280
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,059
and prepare with everything you've got,

281
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,759
the end part actually doesn't really matter in the end, does it?

282
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,360
And it's easy to say that, harder to live it,

283
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,759
but clearly, you know, and that's the same in life, isn't it?

284
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,019
So, it's always, you know, you can't predict the results.

285
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,860
You can only control the amount of effort, your time you put in.

286
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,860
When you do, it sort of takes the pressure away from life and sport, isn't it?

287
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,259
It's such a profound way to approach it.

288
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,919
I'm not surprised.

289
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,779
And I pick up on what you said, too.

290
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,899
I can speak to people I play with.

291
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,940
You could go around six, 2001, and we played Essendon.

292
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:08,820
I could not have any idea of any moment at all,

293
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,080
and surprised that I was actually there when someone brings it back to me.

294
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,700
Yeah, maybe, not as, I suppose, can't articulate the way you did,

295
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,200
but probably something similar there as well.

296
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,779
Stace, you know, it's been great connecting and collaborating with you in recent times.

297
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,080
And I'm looking forward to telling the story,

298
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,279
because post the World Cup, around that time,

299
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,500
with you and you joined one of our Leader Connect groups.

300
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,580
And if you don't mind, I want to do this,

301
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:39,840
because often on this podcast, I'm talking about these, you know,

302
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,360
incredible people that connect with us, but I love the diversity of it as well.

303
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,299
And so, the group that you started with, if you don't mind me mentioning,

304
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,220
you know, Stacey Moreland, fresh from coming back into the World Cup of Lacrosse,

305
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,759
with a guy called Paul Daly from Gemtree Wines, who's, you know, great story.

306
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,720
They've had their own challenges, the wine industry, in recent times.

307
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,759
Greg Box from the...

308
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,500
Bass Coast Council, manager of people and culture down there.

309
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,120
Samantha Nanny does some amazing work in Life Education Victoria.

310
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,080
Bryce Middleton is packet and race course here in Victoria.

311
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,399
Bryce, you know, runs that world.

312
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,580
Simon Naismith is the director of coaching Australian Volleyball.

313
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,940
Bringing together these people, different backgrounds, people that you hadn't known before.

314
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,320
And for you to start there and then join us full-time, Stace, has just been such a...

315
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,919
Can you explain better than I do?

316
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,840
I never do.

317
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,919
Great job of explaining what it is a Leader Connect is all about.

318
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,720
What does it look like from your point of view?

319
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,059
Well, I think originally I was searching for something that was different than

320
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,919
everything else there for leadership that was out there.

321
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,759
And I'd done a lot of leadership courses in the past where it was a lecturer

322
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,159
and you did small group work.

323
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:52,419
And I just never felt like I walked away with stuff I could necessarily use in real life.

324
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,139
So, when I had stumbled upon a leader, I decided to do the program.

325
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:06,460
Mostly to meet new people of different backgrounds, to get insights and inspiration and collaboration

326
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,779
from people that had a different background than I did, to help me gain more tools to

327
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,620
obviously then deliver to the team I was leading and in business as well.

328
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,879
So, the original premise of joining a leader was that, is that I wanted something different.

329
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,179
I wanted to talk to real humans about what they were going through in their life and

330
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,840
ask them how they tackled things.

331
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,080
And their strategies for doing that.

332
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,299
So, that was sort of how it originally started for me.

333
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,700
And it was a really stimulating process to have real authentic conversations in a really

334
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,580
trusting environment.

335
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,980
And it brought me a lot of joy, like sitting in those sessions for an hour and 15 minutes

336
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,120
and learning about leadership dimensions, but also just, like I said, sitting there

337
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,419
and having real conversations with people about things that were challenges for them

338
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:59,120
and vice versa to support me.

339
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,419
And so, that was sort of how it started for me through some big parts of that campaign.

340
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,360
And then to flip over to the other side of being a fly on the wall in the same environment

341
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
almost in facilitating them, it's like the gift that keeps on giving.

342
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:17,659
You're just watching people talk about things that you don't often get to talk about in

343
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,200
real life.

344
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,399
And it is, it does still bring me so much joy and stimulation and challenge and all

345
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,600
of the things that you want out of almost small groups of people that are building a

346
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,600
small culture within themselves that become so connected that they've got these new connections

347
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,179
and networks that they can lean on forever.

348
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:42,600
Because all the groups, for the most part, have stuck together for years to come because

349
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,519
they've become close friends by sharing personal information.

350
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,899
They're very vulnerable.

351
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:55,820
So, for me, it's been that beautiful space to be inspired, to connect, to collaborate

352
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
and to learn from other people.

353
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,259
In real life, to attribute it to your own situation.

354
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,399
And we loved you so much, Stace.

355
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,160
We said, please come and join us.

356
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,400
Come and be part of the team.

357
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,539
That's just been incredible.

358
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,660
Anyone listening to this first part of the conversation will pick up on, you know, Stace's

359
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,200
empathy and her care for people.

360
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,160
But there's a fairly big resilience gene that comes with you as well and not afraid of any

361
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,519
challenge that comes your way and, you know, to see the way that you're just connecting

362
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,599
people in such a profound way, as you said.

363
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,980
And you humbly call it being a fly on the wall.

364
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,880
But you're doing an amazing job of bringing those groups together.

365
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,160
I'm bad at talking about the mechanics of it.

366
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,160
It sounds, to have you sitting here today, I feel like that's worthwhile for people listening

367
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,660
sometimes.

368
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,700
Like, what does that actually mean?

369
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,359
Could you drill into that a little bit around, you know, what eight sessions look like?

370
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,579
You talked about, which is the beauty of it.

371
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,920
We feel like, you know, this is a connection for life that happens when you form an Elite

372
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,480
Connect group.

373
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,079
And the evidence is showing that's the case, that this community is growing and they stay

374
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,559
together.

375
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,720
But can you just drill into a bit of how it works when you're hosting and facilitating

376
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,200
a group?

377
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,119
Yeah, certainly.

378
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,700
So there is eight sessions in the program and we meet fortnightly.

379
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,319
And each session is about an hour.

380
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,720
Well, it is an hour and 15 minutes.

381
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:19,700
And each week we dive into one of six leadership dimensions that you and Matt obviously developed

382
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,420
within the Elite Connect program.

383
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,079
So we dive into that.

384
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,059
But for the most part, that is a guided question.

385
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,480
For example, if you're talking...

386
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:30,799
If you're talking about collaboration, the question might be what has been a really great

387
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,279
example of collaboration in your environment and a specific hack or strategy you can share.

388
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,880
And then we'll share within the group anything that comes to mind that they can share with

389
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,619
each other that they can then take away and use in their own environments.

390
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,579
And it's incredible what people come up with, particularly when they're really diverse groups

391
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:48,839
from all different backgrounds.

392
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,579
And then typically the second half of that session is diving into someone's challenge

393
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:55,660
or hurdle that they're facing.

394
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,660
And we...

395
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:03,519
We do coaching around helping them serve each other and give them ideas and strategies

396
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,559
for thinking about it differently, where they can challenge each other's thoughts,

397
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,099
offer some more possibilities of ways that they could tackle it.

398
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,019
And the whole course does start with a empowering leader indicator report where they take it

399
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,279
to the team they're leading currently and find some feedback that will help them find

400
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,460
factors that they probably need to put a little bit more time into in terms of opportunities.

401
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:38,599
And then we use that as a way to guide them through the program, but mostly they're leaning

402
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:46,500
on each other to tackle challenges, hurdles, as well as really start to use some self-reflection

403
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,059
in what works for them and what doesn't, to share it, to help people either use what they've

404
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,619
done or stay away from what they've done that didn't work for them either.

405
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,299
I need you here every podcast day.

406
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,480
Because you sum it up in such a better way than I ever are able to do.

407
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,319
And I love what you said.

408
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,319
It feels like there is a bit of a shift in learning for a lot of people.

409
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,480
We know that doing MBAs or long studies is a brilliant thing.

410
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,920
And looking back at case studies is clearly a pathway, so no judgment there.

411
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,359
But the idea in real time that you've got people with real problems...

412
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:25,799
And real life is always more fascinating to me than anything you can think of in the past

413
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,200
because life throws...

414
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,980
All of us have these challenges.

415
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,559
So to have that group of people, as you just described, Stace, that are in your corner,

416
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,940
understanding, you're totally trusting, totally confidential environment, but can offer a

417
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,759
different way of thinking.

418
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,460
And that's the beauty of diversity, isn't it?

419
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,619
It's the beauty of you and I come from completely different backgrounds, so you're naturally

420
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,220
going to think about things in a different way.

421
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,559
So it's pretty special.

422
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,019
And you're not emotionally connected to your problem.

423
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,380
Yeah.

424
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,940
People that are outside your sphere that aren't connected to the outcome.

425
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,220
It doesn't affect them.

426
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,119
So it's a genuine space.

427
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,619
It's a genuine space for them to give you some feedback that's not going to serve them

428
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,220
in the long term.

429
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,299
So there's no bias.

430
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:06,539
It's just pure helping, serving each other to be better.

431
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
Such a great point to make, Stace.

432
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,180
And I love it because you're right, isn't it?

433
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,119
That unconscious bias.

434
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,920
You might have the best boss in the world who really wants to help you, but they've

435
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
got a vested interest in you.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,839
They are there with good reason for wanting you to stay or whatever that bias may be.

437
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:24,900
Yeah.

438
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:24,960
Yeah.

439
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:24,980
Yeah.

440
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

441
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,019
Yeah.

442
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:25,039
Yeah.

443
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,059
Yeah.

444
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:25,079
Yeah.

445
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,099
Yeah.

446
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:25,180
Yeah.

447
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,279
Yeah.

448
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:25,299
Yeah.

449
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:25,359
Yeah.

450
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:25,420
Yeah.

451
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,460
Yeah.

452
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:25,519
Yeah.

453
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:25,539
Yeah.

454
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:25,619
Yeah.

455
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:25,660
Yeah.

456
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:25,680
Yeah.

457
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:25,700
Yeah.

458
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:25,779
Yeah.

459
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,460
Just in your corner.

460
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,660
And I do this a lot, probably to our own detriment sometimes, but I love it because I like throwing

461
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,640
the names out there because hopefully people can see themselves in some of the groups that

462
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,559
you're hosting and facilitating now.

463
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,279
And they are just bright and confidential, so I have no idea of the content.

464
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,579
But Sandy Brondello, the Opals head coach, New York Liberty head coach, seeing her connect

465
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:55,700
with John Bertrand, who's been on this podcast, who's a legend, Brad Fittler, NRL legend,

466
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,259
Daryl Franklin, who's the chief of staff at Green Bay, Pat Clifton, who's an Australian

467
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,140
guy doing amazing stuff in the NBA.

468
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,500
So it must be fascinating for you, Stace, when you're hosting those groups and seeing some

469
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,980
of the life learnings and hacks that come out of it.

470
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,019
I can see the smile on your face.

471
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,220
It sounds like you just love the wisdom that's shared.

472
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Oh, it is.

473
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,099
It's like when you are a curious person and want to learn all the time, you're in an environment

474
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:25,019
where you're constantly exposed to high-level thinkers.

475
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,619
And no matter what level they are or what they've achieved, the people that come into

476
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,619
the program want to be better.

477
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:34,839
And they are high achievers in some form, because they're there to be better leaders

478
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,700
for the people they're leading.

479
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,200
So for me, I mean, what's cooler than sitting in a room listening to people talk about leadership

480
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,019
and what they've done in the past and things that have worked for them and watching people

481
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,279
lean on each other for support?

482
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,279
There's just nothing cooler.

483
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,039
And I mentioned this a little bit before, I'm a bit obsessed with the book I'm reading

484
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,039
at the moment.

485
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,779
One of the surveys that has come out of it.

486
00:22:54,779 --> 00:23:01,779
It's progressed so far, there's a survey in America, that the most responded answer

487
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,539
around the people that you can connect with is Joanne Hari's book, Lost Connections.

488
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,420
And I'm looking forward to reading his next book at the moment, Stolen Focus, which has

489
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
been out for a while.

490
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,099
But he talks about most people now say they haven't got one trusted, confident in their

491
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,099
life.

492
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,819
And just how sad that is.

493
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,920
Even historically, the average was three.

494
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,779
And so to not have anyone that you can turn to.

495
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,779
Yeah.

496
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:30,380
It's sort of diminished in such a way that our whole purpose is about inspiring connections

497
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,839
and creating that world of collaboration and I'm incredibly grateful, Stace, that that's

498
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,839
what you're doing.

499
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,440
Head to elitacollective.com if you want to connect with Stace, book a call with us and

500
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
we can tell you more about it.

501
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,279
I want to talk about your business, your own business, Show and Tell Online.

502
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,619
And in preparation for this, I was telling you before we started, I've been listening

503
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,779
to your podcast, Show and Tell Online with Monty, Mel and Stacey.

504
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:53,779
That is hilarious.

505
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:58,819
I was laughing all night last night and I said to you before I started, I'm pretty sure

506
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm not your target demographic, Stace, but you can see just this incredible bond, you

507
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,180
three great friends of God.

508
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,180
And I said, you're loose.

509
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,799
You say stuff that we could never get away with, but it's a great connection.

510
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,839
Tell us about the passion behind that.

511
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,339
Yeah, really cool.

512
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,839
We started it probably 10, it was 10 years ago with my best mate, Monty.

513
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,440
We've been best friends since we were 14.

514
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,859
And Brooke Campbell-Bays actually, who left the business a few years ago.

515
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:36,119
We started it 10 years ago as a way to connect women through conversation, organic, raw conversation.

516
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,420
So they felt like they were listening to their girlfriend sitting in a room, talking and-

517
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,200
I felt like I shouldn't have been in that room, by the way.

518
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah.

519
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
That was so funny.

520
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,079
But we did it so, parenting young kids is quite lonely too.

521
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,240
And we started it when we first had our children.

522
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,680
So we wanted to give women a way to have those needs met, a friendship, you know, females

523
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
need females.

524
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,240
They need that conversation and rawness and honesty.

525
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,119
So that's how it started.

526
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,059
And it's morphed over the years, obviously.

527
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:15,539
It was originally us having conversations with well-known Australian women on video,

528
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:21,200
and then it moved into a lot of social media and all these parts, and now it's a thriving

529
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,059
podcast of just sitting.

530
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sitting there waffling on basically, but it is very funny.

531
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,900
We have a really engaged, authentic audience, which is very cool.

532
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,299
It's been an amazing process to learn small business along the way, but to do it with

533
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,299
your best mates is incredible.

534
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:38,299
And it's brilliant.

535
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,299
I encourage you to check it out.

536
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:45,559
And that's what I love about, you know, if it's not your world, when you see people connecting

537
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:51,299
properly and the humor that comes out of it, I was listening to my, she was doing an interview

538
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,299
with Ursula Kahn.

539
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:58,940
Ursula Carlson, who's a brilliant South African-born comedian, and I'm like, you can't say that.

540
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,839
You cannot actually say that, apparently you can, but it's genius.

541
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,839
It's outstanding.

542
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,539
And then as that led into, so the business part of it is, you know, clearly a lot of,

543
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:14,619
as you said, you know, loneliness of, you know, watching Beck in our world, you come

544
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,339
home with four kids, more people around you than ever before, but you're more isolated

545
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,339
than ever.

546
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:24,019
And that need for that sort of connection and then sharing it, it's a brilliant space

547
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,579
and it's been something you've enjoyed.

548
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:27,579
I've loved it.

549
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:34,339
Look, it's given me a beautiful platform to learn a lot about small business and how to

550
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:39,220
do certain things that I never would have learned to do, and to do it when I had small

551
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
children at home.

552
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,099
While I was still in an elite environment in sports, I had switched over to coaching.

553
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:48,980
So I was still coaching Australian teams and doing that in between my retirement.

554
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,200
So to be able to, to work and be stimulated and still learning in small business and

555
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,220
doing things we're really passionate about while also being able to fulfill the sports

556
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,460
side of things and have young children, but to be home with them, to do all the drop offs

557
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,480
and pickups to, you know, yeah, it was hard.

558
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,519
I had to work at nighttime and on weekends when my husband was home, but it was, it was

559
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,960
a beautiful way for me to be present with my children and still be stimulated and create

560
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:23,509
a business that we were making a difference in people's lives.

561
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,509
We catch up.

562
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,509
And you know, often the parents, you know, they're like, you know, what's going on?

563
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,509
You know, what's going on?

564
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:27,509
You know, what's going on?

565
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:28,509
And it's just, it's just a really exciting conversation to start straight away.

566
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:29,509
And I love it.

567
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:30,509
And it happens on this podcast all the time as well.

568
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:32,750
I think a lot of us are united by that.

569
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,529
I mentioned in the, in the opening, you've got three young boys, your leadership as a,

570
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:41,990
as a mum, I can see the great empathy and care that you've got, but you're pretty tough

571
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,990
too.

572
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,230
How would you describe the parenting style that you bring?

573
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,470
Yeah, it's interesting.

574
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:55,029
I think I'm probably the most hard on myself in this area because I want them to be, I

575
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:57,029
just really want them to be happy.

576
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,309
Like I want them to have the skills to be resilient enough to know they can do hard

577
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:05,369
things and to have the courage to be themselves.

578
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,150
But obviously I, you know, I'm very conscious of always putting him in an environment where

579
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,930
they're proving to themselves, they can do hard things so that as they grow, they're

580
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,309
not afraid of failing and trying things and thinking outside the box and being who they

581
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:20,309
are.

582
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:24,029
Um, you know, the day, the days are hard like this.

583
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:34,109
There's certainly no easy way to parent and three boys are hectic, but I have just sent

584
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:40,150
my last one to school, which is, you know, a little bit sad, but also liberating at the

585
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,470
same time.

586
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,789
But I have built, structured a life where I have been with them the whole way through,

587
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:48,289
which I'm incredibly grateful for.

588
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,029
And obviously, you know, my husband and I are a great team and we've, we've built a

589
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,029
life that we intended to.

590
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,029
And we've built a life that we've been with them the whole way through.

591
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,029
Yeah.

592
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:56,029
And we've been able to do that, which is great.

593
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:01,490
But you know, parenting has brought to, brought things out in me that I never actually knew

594
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,490
I had.

595
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:09,829
Like I didn't realize that I was actually quite impatient and quite irritable.

596
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:15,269
And I do have that, like all of the vices, all of the great things about me are also

597
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:19,690
my vices, you know, that I want to be achieving all the time.

598
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,109
And you can't, you can't do things when you want to do things when you've got little kids,

599
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:23,990
like it's.

600
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,410
I don't want to serve them first and then things get cut off and I don't like to start

601
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,069
a task that I can't finish.

602
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:34,549
So it's all these little things that parenting brings up, but it's probably been the biggest

603
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:42,930
learning of who I am since I've become a parent has been crazy.

604
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,029
Like I would never have told, I would have said I was someone completely different before

605
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,029
I had kids.

606
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,029
Yeah.

607
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,029
I'm not surprised.

608
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,490
It's, it's the ultimate mirror up, isn't it?

609
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,490
It just, and it's confronting, isn't it?

610
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,490
Yeah.

611
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,009
And I think that's what's brought out that all the time, isn't it?

612
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:59,390
And it's like, that's brought out something and I'm often going, you know, I'm going to

613
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,730
have to claim that behavioral trait.

614
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,170
That one's probably come from me.

615
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,390
I think, geez, you know, when it comes back at you and you hear it.

616
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,009
But I love these conversations because I still feel like we don't have them enough.

617
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:14,970
You know, as a father talking to a mother and sharing, it's the sharing economy, which

618
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,210
is again, you know, part of the huge passion for what we're doing with Leader and Leader

619
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,430
Connect is just have more of these conversations because you know, I often think the fact that

620
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,430
you care.

621
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,849
You and Mike are so invested, you know, and they won the lottery, those three boys, they're

622
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:28,849
just going to have them.

623
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,529
Well, soon find out, won't we?

624
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,609
Well, that's the confronting part, isn't it?

625
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:36,009
But I know that, you know, all the evidence is in it.

626
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,730
You're going to have your moments, but when you sort of invested as much as that, that's

627
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,490
about as good as you can do, isn't it?

628
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,430
There's going to be all the bumps and challenges along the way, but by being there and as you

629
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,430
said, intentionally carving out your life to make sure you're there, the fact that you

630
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,430
are, I hope because that's been it.

631
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
We've tried to do it.

632
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,430
We've tried to do it.

633
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,430
Yeah.

634
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,430
And we've tried to do it.

635
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,430
We've tried to do it.

636
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,430
We've tried to do it.

637
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,430
It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

638
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,430
Yeah.

639
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,430
Which occasionally go wrong horribly.

640
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,430
We've all been there before.

641
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,430
I didn't know you're a marriage celebrant.

642
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,430
Oh yeah, I am.

643
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,910
Geez, God, I do too many things, don't I?

644
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,910
I, yes, I am.

645
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:12,849
I, one of my best mates that I grew up with actually asked me to marry them and classic

646
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,730
me thought, well, you know, I'll just do the course.

647
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,930
It's not that simple.

648
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,890
Like it's a full year.

649
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,890
It's legal stuff.

650
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,890
It's all this.

651
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,890
It was ridiculous.

652
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,569
And I abused her for about 12 months through the process of it, but, and yes, ended up

653
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,309
doing it, which has been really great.

654
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:35,849
And now I mostly do it to, for people that I know and, you know, want it to be a relaxed

655
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,890
environment or, you know, have someone I'm marrying them that they're really comfortable

656
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,890
with.

657
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,269
But that's been really cool too, but it's probably going to slip to the side.

658
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,269
I think, I think I've bitten off more than I can chew.

659
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:49,829
Well, I can imagine you, you know, being brilliant a lot of things, but particularly that, because

660
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,890
that is an important day and everyone's been.

661
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,890
Yeah.

662
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:59,849
I've been to the ceremony where the, you know, the priest goes rogue, you know, don't, you

663
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:03,289
know, I've been to many of those weddings, not the day to talk about footy today.

664
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,990
I know there's a lot of footy people, please don't, but they can't help themselves.

665
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,369
And that, you know, the emotional day, I've seen that nearly spill over from time to time.

666
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,890
You would be absolutely perfect for that.

667
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,970
I'm looking forward to your answer to these questions, Stace, because you're so invested

668
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,849
in, and we are so grateful to, to, to be working with you day to day.

669
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,809
So, you know, these topics really well, but you know, I often think to myself, geez, I'd

670
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:27,809
find them hard to answer.

671
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:31,109
So I'm looking forward to hearing what your thoughts are.

672
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:33,930
Self-leadership, Stace, I can see that written all over you.

673
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,930
What does that mean to you?

674
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,269
Look, I think it means a few things when I think about it.

675
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:44,809
I think mostly everybody has a set of values that they live by and they can change over

676
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,990
time, I think, depending on what stage of life you're in.

677
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,849
But for me, it's being consistently disciplined in what I put out.

678
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:57,930
What I put into the world and what values that I attribute to being how I want people

679
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,430
to see me move through the world.

680
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,490
So that's probably one thing.

681
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,670
I think one of the biggest things for self-leadership for me is self-awareness and understanding

682
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,309
how you make people feel is a big one.

683
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:16,470
And just, you know, whether you're adding value to their lives and value to your own.

684
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,470
And there is something to be said for, you know, having to serve yourself before you

685
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,470
can serve others.

686
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,789
Which is not that easy, like I struggle with that as well, but I think if we, you know,

687
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:32,509
if I exhibit accountability for the things that I believe in most over time and I'm consistent

688
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:38,390
with it, then my relationships are really trusted, healthy relationships because people

689
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,250
know what they're going to get.

690
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,430
And I know what I'm going to give.

691
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,769
So for me, I think self-leadership is probably focusing on the things that you value most

692
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:49,470
and living them every day.

693
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,710
And being self-aware of when you're not.

694
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,450
Yeah.

695
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,650
It's such a brilliant answer, Stacey, and that's what I love about these conversations

696
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:02,509
because I just learn so much and reflect, so do I, and again, it comes back to so much

697
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:03,509
of your essence.

698
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,349
And, and one of the things we are trying to spread through this world is that thought

699
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:10,150
about how do we impact others positively?

700
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,150
Feels like a shift, doesn't it?

701
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,469
Feels like we were taught when we grew up about what you need to do around self-help,

702
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:21,110
all about self and everything was all about, I need this to have a better life and I need

703
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,110
more.

704
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:27,030
And I think that as soon as you put your focus a little bit elsewhere on to helping someone

705
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,130
else as you do instinct, you know, from the age of the youngest possible age, there's

706
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,889
a lot more joy in that, isn't there?

707
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,150
It's a stick and it's a learnt skill too, isn't it?

708
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,150
It's something you can learn.

709
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,949
It is a learnt skill, but I think people are happier when they're serving other people.

710
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:47,170
I do think it's a part of how to be happy in life is to make sure that you're adding

711
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,150
value to other people's lives, even in the smallest of interactions.

712
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,150
And that leads to, you know, you're going to be involved in a lot of different things.

713
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:56,309
that leads to you know what you do positively impacting others and you know i loved uh you

714
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:00,190
know listening and doing some homework before today and you could just see the photos of you

715
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,329
with your teammates or with your friends or on the podcast or every environment you're in we see it

716
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:10,409
every day with you at a leader as well that you live and breathe those values is that what you

717
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:14,309
think about about the impact you have on others oh darce i think it's probably the thing i think

718
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:21,670
about the most i think i live in a constant inner dialogue of how do i make them feel then how can i

719
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:28,050
make sure i'm adding value here and look i i was really lucky that i grew up a lot of things went

720
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:34,670
right for me i had two very invested parents that basically growth coached me through life

721
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:42,829
trusted my opinion on pretty much anything i had a coach susa farness who coached me probably 80

722
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:43,590
in my career

723
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,690
a college coach as well that was really fundamental in in the growth of me as a person but

724
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:56,530
susa farness in particular had a motto she lived by that is very easy to use as a filter and it's

725
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:02,329
that nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care you you can't have a

726
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:08,550
positive impact on people if they don't think you care about them so for me a lot of the things i

727
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,050
filter through are i just want people to know i actually care about them even if it's in a five

728
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:13,570
minute conversation i don't care about them i just want people to know i actually care about

729
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:19,269
them even if it's in a five minute conversation but i think it's also the the importance of

730
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:24,530
building relationships so strong that they can bear the truth is part of that and to have a

731
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:30,409
positive impact on people particularly if i'm coaching or leading them is really important that

732
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:35,809
that foundation is really strong so that we they can be pushed to meet their potential

733
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:42,530
and that's being able to tell the truth like honesty is having a positive impact particularly

734
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,550
i wouldn't have a positive impact on people if i didn't have a positive impact on them

735
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,329
honest conversation with someone if i hadn't created a foundation though either

736
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:54,789
but there was also the cost of that is time though to be able to be a great leader and

737
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:58,449
have a foundation of a strong relationship to have a positive impact the cost of great

738
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:03,570
leadership is time and it is it's the text it's the check-ins it's all the things that go in

739
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,449
creating that foundation there was also a book i read about 20 years ago and i flipped from

740
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:13,550
playing in college to coaching and i wasn't ready to flip but my coach was

741
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,090
dying of a brain tumor and had asked me to stay on and coach straight after college so i did

742
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,269
but i did i did a disservice to myself and to the players i think because i was very much in that

743
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:29,090
state of just do it like as a player i was like what are you doing just go and do the job i don't

744
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,530
get why you can't do it but i was too immature to do it at the time but i read a really great

745
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:40,010
book from donnie tony di cecco who was the usa women's soccer coach through the mia ham era when

746
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,550
they were changing the face of female sports and the title of the book was the USA women's soccer coach

747
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:49,349
still what i live by it's called catch them being good and it was just the simple act of

748
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:58,250
just catch people doing the good things more than what you want them to stop doing so now

749
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:04,150
if i'm giving feedback or coaching or trying to have an impact on people around me i focus on

750
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,829
telling them what i want to see more of rather than what i want them to stop doing so catch

751
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,829
them being good has been such a huge phrase in my life

752
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,949
but you know one of the things to having a positive impact impact i find myself having

753
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,269
incessant conversations with people about and particularly players about i don't feel

754
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:31,630
confident right now that's such a funny statement to me but i realized the reason why i never

755
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,690
struggled with that was because i was always in an environment where forgiveness was

756
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,849
around me and i was really cutthroat like to be fair i was a player that was

757
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,789
a see ball get ball didn't matter how i was going to get it i was going to get the ball from

758
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:55,989
someone but it put my team in at risk sometimes of fouls and situations and but i 95 percent of

759
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:01,849
my career i was in an environment where forgiveness was instant move on to the next one move on to

760
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,550
next one so it created a space of bravery for me and and forgiveness does create bravery it gives

761
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,210
people the ability to move through something so quickly that they're brave enough to do it again

762
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,550
so i think those few

763
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,449
pillars for me is what i try to stick with when i'm trying to have a positive impact on people

764
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:24,829
amazing wisdom there stace and i you know i love writing stuff down i love that you know from your

765
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,849
your coach you clearly had a massive impact such a brilliant line that isn't it no one cares how

766
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:34,570
much you know until they know how much you care it's just such a shift in sport around that you

767
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,989
know i've talked a lot about the era we played in there's none of that it's hierarchical and

768
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:43,550
you're the weaker where you're strong and you can cope where you can't and you know i think that's

769
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,849
a lot of us saw a bit of craziness in that and so it's such a healthier for you to have that

770
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,070
environment as you said that's there's a bit of good fortune in that isn't it having someone who

771
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:58,829
whole career college was a lot of discipline but it was a it was family as well but i i was always

772
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:04,510
in an environment where it was collaborating and care and there was a really strong foundation

773
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,789
underneath and clearly that shaped you and you pass it on and i love that you know catch them

774
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,469
being great it's such a brilliant thought isn't it and and i

775
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,989
see that you know i spent so much time in junior sport with the four kids and

776
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:23,269
it drives me insane is that the the negative coaching and and people don't know in fairness

777
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:27,909
they just you know some poor little you know kid misses a kick it's nine and the coach screams at

778
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:34,230
him and gets him off it's like no that's not you know as you said the celebration of the stuff

779
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,929
that's good but to to sum it up so clearly like that catch them being great celebrate the good

780
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:43,550
stuff focus less on the mistakes don't matter the snakes don't count at all it's uh

781
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:49,510
no brilliant um for you to share that i i really appreciate it curiosity is a word that

782
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,090
uh in fact i jumped forward um creating and sharing a vision i want to ask you about stace and

783
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,889
you clearly done that in so many areas of your life how have you gone about that

784
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:03,230
i've always thought of vision as creating a collective heartbeat within a group

785
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:10,429
because it's seems like a better foundation for me to work with and i think that's a few

786
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,449
ways you can create a vision but i think

787
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:20,590
before you can share one you need to co-create one because i've never been able to create a

788
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,929
strong vision or culture without co-creating with the people who are going to action it

789
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:32,349
so for me it's spending that time to understand why people are there and i think the challenge

790
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:37,409
of great leadership is everybody's why might be different but you've got to create a purpose and

791
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:42,550
passion that's quite similar in a way so sitting down and co-creating

792
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:49,550
a vision that can be seen i think is is one of those things whether it's the values of your team

793
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:56,750
and what that you want that to look like to the outside world but i think it needs to be a two-way

794
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,349
collaborative experience when you're sharing a vision for it to be actually powerful and actionable

795
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:07,469
and like i said i think the challenge is creating a cohesive set with people who are there for

796
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:12,670
different reasons and often it sounds crazy but you could be going to a world cup and my purpose

797
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,909
i could be i want to win a gold medal someone else's might be oh i just like to play with my

798
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:24,309
mates i don't really care if we win like it's it's bringing those few things together to create

799
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:31,650
a vision that's people can all live within is the challenge but i think doing that two ways

800
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,989
is the most important way to to bring that to life in in my experience

801
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:42,190
but and and that's just been us sitting with groups of people and asking them

802
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,550
who they are and why they're doing it and i think that's the challenge

803
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,769
why they're there and what their purpose and passion is and building it together

804
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:52,050
and as you said before you know showing that you care first regardless of um you know how

805
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:57,050
different your purpose might be and and and that's been the joy of one of the many joys of

806
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,269
working with you stace is just that you know you get that and you bring that to the table and

807
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:06,630
you know we've loved uh trying to create and share that vision with you around a leader as we said

808
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:12,110
before about inspiring those connections and creating a world of collaboration and you know

809
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:13,449
you're setting a high bar

810
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,969
so i hope we're doing it well enough to to not drive you mad at some uh at some point in time

811
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:25,389
um curiosity is a common word that we see stace and and it sort of defines a lot of leaders in

812
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:29,349
the way they think about their learning what does that mean to you oh god sometimes i wish i wasn't

813
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:37,130
so curious sometimes i fry myself wanting to learn stuff all the time but through through curiosity

814
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,650
and learning i think we give ourselves the capacity to create more and to kind of recreate ourselves

815
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,530
over time as well

816
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:53,010
but i also think it's really hard for me to be interesting and passionate and empowering and

817
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:59,869
um without constantly learning like to be able to have more conversations i mean i know when me and

818
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:04,570
you get together we have quite deep conversations like we go straight to things because we're always

819
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,610
living in a space where we're learning and wanting to what do you think about this what do you think

820
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:13,550
about that but i think stimulating my own growth allows me a greater opportunity to be able to be

821
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:21,230
a better opportunity to add value to people's lives and i i do live in a constant state where

822
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:29,150
i want to learn um and like i said before i have lived in a like i almost do research projects

823
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,849
through the learning sometimes about you know what the difference between good and great is and

824
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:38,769
what all those little obstacles are that people face but i think without it i would be really

825
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:43,550
boring i doubt it stay so i think that would be a good thing to do but i think it's a good thing to

826
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:48,590
be a very hard thing to call you boring at any point in time but no i love how you you frame

827
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,289
that again i had this conversation with someone yesterday and i talk about you know just how

828
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:57,769
privileged it is to sit down and talk to to you and and everyone in this format i've loved every

829
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:04,730
bit of it so what do you do with all those notes and i had to say quite often nothing but it's

830
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:11,829
shaping it's shaping and reinforcing you go your language today reinforces so many things that you

831
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:18,030
and i want to do better and i think that's an interesting conversation because you can jump

832
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:23,130
around with curiosity can't i'm all in on whatever it is you know i'm going to change tomorrow and i'm

833
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,409
going to do another course and you can hop from one thing to the next and and you know curiosity

834
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:32,710
is brilliant but do you sort of i think you get at world states where you know your foundations

835
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,650
are who you are and the curiosity layers and and you're open to it but there is a gap between that

836
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,489
and not really knowing who you are at the same time is that is that fair yeah i think it's fair

837
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,130
i do think it's fair but i think the most important thing is grabbing onto the things

838
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:53,650
that you connect with the most that are actually able you're able to bring to life and not everyone

839
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,429
can do everything they read even if they connect to it and not everyone has a platform to do it

840
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:06,610
either but i think it's it is important to be curious about things because there's a lot of

841
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:12,389
great stuff out there to be curious about for sure communicating uh with clarity and you do that

842
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,989
incredibly well and and as i said i you know i found myself um flying the wall on the podcast

843
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:25,289
last night watching that and and just seeing you with your mates uh you know made me smile because

844
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:29,010
you know you've got your own language which is brilliant is that you always do when you have

845
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,929
those close friendships but is it something that you've thought about in your sporting world your

846
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:38,429
business world communicating with clarity all the time particularly when you're coaching i think

847
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:42,190
in in sports and in other areas as well i think

848
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,230
important thing for me is getting to know people well enough to know how they like to be

849
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,670
communicated with because people are different now like it's not on a phone or face to face

850
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:57,829
some people don't like that it might be you know i remember you know leading players in this team

851
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:02,269
that needed me to go straight at them between the eyes just be better this isn't good enough

852
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:08,130
but then another person might need a different form of communication of let me give a positivity

853
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,090
first and then so it's i think it's about knowing how people want to receive communication

854
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,590
and make sure that's two-way i don't i don't think it can't it can't be one way um so learning

855
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:27,309
about the language they respond to best i think is important there but for me it's i just lean

856
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:34,409
on the truth always i always lean on the truth because if i would never want someone to wonder

857
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:39,630
if what i said was true or not or if i was just saying it to make them feel good but that goes

858
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,210
back to building relationships so strong they can bear the truth i think

859
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:49,869
that that's one of the most important things i lean on is truth i think for probably two hacks i've

860
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:55,929
had that i use on the daily almost is or particularly when i was doing you know

861
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:00,110
pre-game speech half-time you know even in meetings delivering things in meetings whatever

862
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:07,909
it was is delivery over content i used to spend so much time on the content i was delivering to

863
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:12,309
the team like my half-time speech my pre-game speech my this my that instead of

864
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:18,269
how i was delivering it to them and that's like passion body language all those things that go

865
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:24,469
into it is the cell i was watching literally darcy yesterday watching kevin hart talk about green

866
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:32,690
super powder but he was so um in great like i was so engrossed in what he was saying because of the

867
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,530
way he was telling the story yeah that i was like i need to buy that i didn't even hear what it was

868
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:43,550
about yeah it was just so captivating and i think we i i know i have spent way too much time on the

869
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:50,230
content and not enough time on delivery so when when i heard that i was like oh this is this is

870
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,070
what i need obviously the content needs to be good still but people are watching how you're giving it

871
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:00,289
to them more than what you're saying and look you know there's the little things like i don't give

872
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:06,130
more than three things in a half time or you know i don't give my kids more than one thing to do at

873
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:12,670
a time you know there's little ways to be clear and it's by not over speaking not over coaching

874
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:20,110
but also you know to just deliver something with a little bit of gusto and it kind of goes a long way

875
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:25,690
great advice all around um collaboration how important has that been for you oh god i think

876
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,969
collaboration is everything i think about getting my kids to school in the morning with collaboration

877
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:34,630
like well they're probably not collaborating but i think to be a great collaborator you need to be

878
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:43,139
self-aware and and it goes back to being aware of what if you're adding value to someone and one of

879
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,119
the one of the key mantras i live by in this space is to be self-aware and to be self-aware

880
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:50,900
is do i need to add value to that person's thought or do i need to shut up and that's

881
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,840
collaborating it's me understanding if i keep adding to someone's thought i'm going to steal

882
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,519
their thoughts not their thought anymore that's not collaborating so one of those that's one of

883
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:05,760
the the things um that i cling to for sure when i'm trying to collaborate with people

884
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,780
but i i do everything's a dance isn't it like us right now everything every conversation

885
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,659
is reading the room trying to collaborate in a way that make people feel really good

886
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:18,059
i know at a leader we use a quote in our collaboration

887
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,980
um dimension when we're talking about it and it's a benjamin franklin quote and matt

888
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,900
wadowitz actually uses it all the time too and it's called tell me and i forget teach me and i

889
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,920
remember involve me and i learn and it's a really great reminder of involving people in the process

890
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,480
and collaborating with them is how people learn best rather than just being told what to do and

891
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,119
we often skip those steps i think so there's some obviously some really great

892
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:51,300
um ways to collaborate but i think it is just god for me it's just knowing when to add value and

893
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,820
when to shut up i think you've got a great balance and a great perspective and a great way of um

894
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:03,559
of expressing exactly what you mean states it's uh it's great listening to it again who's been

895
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:09,260
the greatest leader in your life geez this is a loaded question actually um i think i've grabbed

896
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,780
from a million different places darth yeah i think you know my dad was the one who started

897
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:22,599
the it's just a game get over it so he gave me that message very young it's just a game no one

898
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:28,380
didn't die just play the game go home forget about it yeah and it was a massive gift to be able to

899
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:36,840
go hard walk off the pitch and be done to be able to switch off um and he he's a he's a unit like he

900
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,460
was rough you know he he played lacrosse too he played lacrosse and dirt biking footy got injured

901
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,940
you know he was an animal

902
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:51,280
he's very injured very young but built like a very you know i was i'm built like him the

903
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,139
physicality of being able to put your body through a lot comes from your dad yeah but he gave you

904
00:51:57,139 --> 00:52:02,199
that gift of perspective as well yeah he just never understood why people were just hanging

905
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:08,059
on to stuff it's just a game you know and it served me through my whole life yeah my mom was

906
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:11,619
probably the relationship she grew up with disability she was born with spina bifida

907
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:19,079
she had the ability to build relationships and you know have conversations and she's a beautiful

908
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:26,380
friend and um she made me uh appreciate my body i was you know built like a boy in a way i was

909
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,119
didn't want to wear singlets because my muscles were out i didn't and she was always the one that

910
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,019
was like what do you want your body in your body's performing for you yeah so just just the great

911
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:39,920
messaging from someone who couldn't do what i could do um and then i think probably another

912
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,119
one's my husband he's i've never met anyone that's got less ego than him everything's factored out

913
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:50,460
everything's perspective he sees a situation reads a situation just for what it is yeah

914
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:56,000
without any emotional connection to it which is an interesting skill so probably him and then

915
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,559
susa farness was probably my next most profound one we call her mally um she died obviously like

916
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:09,619
i said before two two years ago suddenly during a campaign but you know she she was the glue that

917
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:14,039
held australian lacrosse together the most decorated player and coach of all time and

918
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:15,119
she relentlessly

919
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:20,300
gave herself to the sport and i think she taught me what culture was how to build culture and what

920
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,679
it took and how much effort and how much time so she's the gift that keeps on giving i still go

921
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:30,800
back to jesus what would she do here what would she say there and all those things an epic

922
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,239
storyteller um and we're now living through her you know keeping her legacy alive with the suze

923
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:43,119
safanas foundation which her her got her dream was to not ever have finances involved in bringing

924
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,119
the best team together for australian women's lacrosse

925
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:52,260
and that foundation was um for the first time in the last world cup was fully funded because of her

926
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,800
foundation and her family's done a beautiful job of doing that so we're keeping that alive that way

927
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,960
as best we can yeah what a brilliant yeah amazing stuff isn't it to have that in your life isn't to

928
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,219
have a mum and dad i love people who reference their parents who are lucky enough to and i feel

929
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:12,000
exactly the same way and then as you said before to have that influence in your life and uh and a

930
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,119
partner mike is uh you know as um as brilliant as it's been and i think it's going to be a great

931
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:20,719
sounds as well is a real gift so people that want to support sport and and women's lacrosse how do

932
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:26,059
you get involved in the foundation oh the foundation is obviously you can google suze

933
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:33,159
foundation to to um do it in any way you can whether it's just sharing or um donating whatever

934
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:38,119
that is i think lacrosse in general the exciting thing is where june july we'll find out for certain

935
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:44,119
if it's in the 2028 olympics in la which is pretty massive pretty massive and looking pretty good

936
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:51,880
massive game yeah com games 2030 is pretty much locked in yeah uh so i think for us it's just that

937
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,219
putting that time into the grassroots of getting it in schools and getting in front of people

938
00:54:55,219 --> 00:55:02,079
there is clubs around the country obviously but it's um we're in the process of building to

939
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,920
now get into the it's a different format the games are different at olympics they've moved

940
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:14,360
it into more of a basketball style bit smaller a bit faster um so so that's interesting but we're

941
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,119
heading for big things in the future so i think it's a great thing to do and i think it's a great

942
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:19,159
i think so there's and there's a lot of opportunity in lacrosse with you know overseas scholarships

943
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:24,460
and you know you get country state trips all those sorts of things so it's an exciting time for the

944
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,079
sports are in a pretty pretty big building phase not beyond you to come out and play in los angeles

945
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:37,440
in 2028 the one thing you haven't done playing olympics um how good for for lacrosse and

946
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,099
there's going to be a massive result all around if you collaborate with anyone stays in

947
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:44,980
diverse areas of your life and we love we're so uh

948
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:50,420
uh rap that we get to collaborate with you but is there any one or anything that springs to mind

949
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,079
god this is a really hard question i didn't prepare for i do think i get to like collaborating

950
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,360
with you guys at elita has been an incredibly enriching experience for me there's probably a

951
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,039
few i'd be really interested to sit in a room with george mumford have you heard of george

952
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,619
i don't know george mumford he he wrote a book called the mindful athlete he was the right-hand

953
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,579
man to phil jackson in the era oh yes sorry yes yes and

954
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:19,760
was probably the first one to introduce mindfulness and you know how to create how to

955
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:27,199
develop your mind to be strong enough to withstand high performance challenge and all the critical

956
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,920
thoughts that come through so i'd be i wouldn't even need to talk to him i think i'd just like

957
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,019
to sit in the room and watch him actually interact with people to see how he gets them to perform in

958
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:44,480
a different way so probably him oh god there's a million to ask i couldn't even come up with him

959
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:51,559
all but i do think about him and his influence on on phil jackson as well and a lot of people around

960
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,940
the world have clearly watched the last dance and you got a look at phil jackson in that era and

961
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,380
one of my kids um young will was watching again i sat down the couch and i you know i don't normally

962
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:08,219
watch things twice too often but just taken by phil jackson and clearly um george mumford was

963
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:14,059
had a huge impact and he was big into spirituality phil jackson just the way that he was

964
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:21,639
and you know robin's going off the reservation mid you know playoffs you know doing world

965
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,820
wrestling you know events and coaches in that era just wouldn't they would have exploded and

966
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,500
and the press were like you know he's ruining your playoff series he's disrupting and phil

967
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,400
jackson just calmly said no he's not but i feel like he's ruining yours you know and i was like

968
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,460
it just took the air out of the well don't worry about it he's doing his role like

969
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,360
so ahead of uh ahead of their time in in every sense stay so i

970
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:48,960
