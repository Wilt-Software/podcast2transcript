1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,369
Being a leader for your children is one of the most important things we can do in life.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,690
But how do you know if you're doing a good job and what values are we imparting on them?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,079
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

4
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,699
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,620
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective.

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,520
And I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,960
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:01:08,120
I was joined by Steve Bidulph, the author of many amazing books, including Raising Boys and his latest Fully Human,

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,859
to discuss how we can learn self-awareness, not missing out on opportunities and looking at masculinity

11
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:14,700
from then to now.

12
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:24,459
So Steve is one of the world's best-known parent educators, a psychologist for over 30 years

13
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,319
and the best-selling author of many books, including The Secret of Happy Children, Raising Boys,

14
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,900
The New Manhood, 10 Things Girls Need Most, amongst many others.

15
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,140
His latest book, Fully Human, of Using Your Mind, is like his other books, simply brilliant.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
Couldn't recommend it more highly.

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,719
Steve's books are in over 4 million homes and have been translated in 31 languages.

18
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,719
Steve also has led and funded a five-year human rights initiative.

19
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:54,319
The CivX Memorial Project, Taking a Stand Against the Treatment of Asylum Seekers, Seekers Arriving by Sea.

20
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,519
He's also a patron of the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change.

21
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,200
And on any measure, it is an extraordinary life of leadership.

22
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,200
And Steve Bidulph joins me.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,780
Great to catch up with you, Steve.

24
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,420
Thanks for your time.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,860
Hi, Luke, and hello to everybody listening.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,939
Steve, I probably wanted to start at the beginning for you.

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,659
And I have heard you talk about this, but you were born in Yorkshire in the 1950s.

28
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:23,599
And I've heard you describe that a few times as, well, potentially the capital of bad parenting.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,099
Can I ask why?

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,919
Yes, well, the world capital of negative parenting, I think, was what it was.

31
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:38,039
And yeah, I mean, Yorkshire is a really, people are lovely and very warm-hearted.

32
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,780
But in those days, kids just got clobbered for everything.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
And also, it was normal to tell you that you were no use.

34
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,639
And so my dad would call me.

35
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,120
Which I thought was some kind of monkey.

36
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,520
But it was actually a halfpennyworth or something.

37
00:02:54,259 --> 00:03:02,099
And even when I came to live in Launceston in Tassie, where I live now, it was very familiar because it was a blue-collar town.

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,659
Everyone worked in the mill.

39
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,740
And people loved their kids, but they just called them, you know, you waste of space, you know, you're a piece of shit, you're no use.

40
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,020
That was how people talked to, like, two-year-olds.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,180
And they didn't mean it.

42
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,500
Kids didn't know.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,439
And so we got a bit interested in maybe we could change that.

44
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,240
Maybe it could go a bit better than that.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,180
Did you look back, Steve, and think that that maybe inspired your life in this space?

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,180
Because you are credited rightly with changing the language of parenting for certainly many millions in Australia and around the world.

47
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,080
Do you think your reflection on your own upbringing had a bit to do with that?

48
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,580
Look, it might have.

49
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,580
You never really know what's going to work out.

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
But I had a really nice dad.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And my dad could, he would play with us kids.

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:59,680
And he was part of this thing where you call the football pools, where you would take these football kind of predicting gambling sort of thing around.

53
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,479
And he would take them out for our whole neighbourhood.

54
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,719
And so I'd walk with him at night time while he's delivering all these footy forms to people's houses.

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
And he'd hold my hand.

56
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,180
And he was a huge guy, Luke.

57
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,099
He was 6 foot 11 tall.

58
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:14,580
Wow.

59
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,120
Picture that.

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,980
So I could barely reach his hand.

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,660
You know, I had to kind of lean up.

62
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,680
And I'm 6 foot 4.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,180
But he was the sort of dad that gets you on his knee and, you know, bounce you up and down.

64
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,019
Whereas my mum was a bit more posh and she was a bit more, she was, you know, kind.

65
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,980
But she wasn't into cuddles.

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,639
We had to teach her how to, you know, when we were growing up, we had to teach her how to do a hug.

67
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,620
She finally got to like it and relax a bit.

68
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,939
But in those days, people didn't cuddle kids very much.

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,720
It's amazing how far we've come.

70
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,420
But yeah.

71
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,899
And so I hope I've helped that recovery.

72
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:52,579
Yeah.

73
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,879
Well, I really want to delve into that certainly across the course of this chat about parenting and your influence on that.

74
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,980
I've just got this picture of a 6 foot 11 door-to-door salesman effectively in Yorkshire in the 1950s.

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,220
I mean, that is an enormous height in 2021.

76
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,120
But he must have been a literal giant.

77
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,779
Yes.

78
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,500
And he was a very shy man.

79
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,839
And when he was in his last couple of years, he was a very shy man.

80
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:26,740
A couple of weeks of his life, I remember he was in hospital and I was able to stay in the hospital with him, which was really great.

81
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,180
And one day he told me this story.

82
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,100
He said, two days after you were born, he said, when we got home, I put you in the pram.

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,040
I thought your mum looked a bit tired and exhausted.

84
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,639
I'll put you in the pram and I'll take you for a walk down the street.

85
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,620
And so little sort of three-day-old Steve bit off in the pram and this huge guy.

86
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:54,100
And he went around the corner into the high street where all the shops and everything were in this little rough little town in Yorkshire.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,759
And he said, little kids started running behind him and calling names, calling out stuff.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,439
And even the adults were looking at him like, looking like scowling.

89
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,639
They were scowling at him.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,579
And dad was on a lot of morphine when he told me this story and he was a little bit out of it.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
And he just sort of went quiet.

92
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,819
And I thought, oh, he's just kind of.

93
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,160
You know, going back into the morphine.

94
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,600
And, but just to check, I said, dad, what, what were the kids, what were the kids calling out?

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,360
What were they saying?

96
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,279
And he said, your dad's your mum.

97
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,600
And so they were kind of jeering at him for pushing a pram.

98
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,800
And it was just unknown in the 1950s for guys to do anything to do with babies.

99
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,259
And because he was very shy, he told me he just ducked down a little alleyway.

100
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:46,819
And he took a.

101
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,000
He took a shortcut and got, just went straight home again.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
He just couldn't, couldn't hack it being out there.

103
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,680
And this was one of the last things that he ever told me.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,199
And I sort of took on that.

105
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,399
He was kind of saying, look, as dads in the 20th century, we, we really wanted to be hands-on dads.

106
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,000
You know, we really wanted to have be with our kids, but it kind of wasn't, he wasn't allowed.

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,540
And today, Luke, your generation of dads, you go down the street, we're pushing the stroller.

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,759
Nobody even turns a hair.

109
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
Um, so we, we, that's a revolution.

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,060
We we've changed that and it's just, just one of the best things.

111
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,480
Yeah.

112
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,139
Amazing story, isn't it?

113
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:29,680
Again, you know, to confront a six foot 11 father and, uh, even a shy man to, to have that.

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm gonna find that just a, just a stunning, isn't as a, as a, probably a 21st century dad, you think of, you know, we've, uh, carried the kids everywhere and, and benefited from this change that you've had an enormous amount to, to do.

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,639
I want to jump from there, Steve, and talk about one of your latest themes.

116
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,740
And, and, and the term you use is super sense.

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,959
And on this podcast, we've been talking to a lot of leaders and it is a common theme that is coming up.

118
00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:01,480
I, I think of Kylie Watson Wheeler who runs Disney, and she spoke a lot about her best decisions have always come when she's tapped into that intuition or that gut instinct.

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,579
And you, you take that theme a little bit further and you say super sense is actually a little bit more than that.

120
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:12,259
And, you know, I love the story that you used to, to describe it with, uh, the story of, uh, of Andy Llewellyn.

121
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,360
You, you're able to share that with us.

122
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:13,959
Yes.

123
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,399
Um, for sure.

124
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:27,339
And just so for your listeners to understand super sense is, is the name that I use for what psychologists and cognitive, whatever cognitive science calls parallel processing.

125
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,200
And it's the other side of your brain, which, um, doesn't talk.

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,919
We think with a little bit at the front of our left side of our brain, but the right side of our brain is a big silent computer.

127
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,419
And it, what it does is it takes in everything around us and it looks for what doesn't fit.

128
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,500
And Andy was a patient of mine long ago in the 1980s.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,500
And she was a young mom and she was also a GP doctor, and she was.

130
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,100
In a car park in the middle of the day and a young man called out to her.

131
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:10,440
And she was by herself just coming back from having lunch with friends and, and he was well dressed the head of suit on, and he was a fair way away still.

132
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,860
And he was, she couldn't hear what he was calling them, but he, he sort of like, he wanted help with something.

133
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,360
He lost his.

134
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,559
phone or something like that and she was just on the brink of like putting her bags down and going

135
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,019
across to see what what he needed when she got this little kind of clinch in the bottom of her

136
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:31,980
belly in a bit of her stomach and and she just kind of had like a little mini panic attack

137
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,899
within like a microsecond she just jumped in her car locked the doors and skidded out of there

138
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:45,059
just got out of there thinking to herself you know what's what was that about you know the

139
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,519
poor guy she could see the guy in her rearview mirror you know so just standing there looking

140
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:56,000
kind of stunned and she got home she put it out of her mind that night the kids are in bed she

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,019
turned on the nine o'clock news a woman had been assaulted in the car park of her train station

142
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:11,659
by that young man and luckily he'd been interrupted and caught but it had happened

143
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:14,460
minutes after she'd been there and her husband

144
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:20,360
found her sobbing on the couch because she just realized she almost could have been killed and also

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,220
the complicated thing that your listeners will understand that because she didn't someone else did

146
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:35,279
um so it's called survivor guilt and but putting back her mental health she came she had a lot of

147
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,879
post-traumatic stress kind of things and she didn't just get back to normal she got past normal

148
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:53,480
what we realized was she'd been she was had an acutely aware of um intuitive gut feelings

149
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,419
that were able to literally save her life and the thing is that why i wrote about this and i gave it

150
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:07,820
the name super sense in the book is that everyone's got this and it's going all the time and so it

151
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,899
doesn't have to be a big dramatic emergency it's going in everyone listening to this right now it's

152
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:21,659
um giving you an emotional response to what i'm saying and what's going on it's not always

153
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,759
correct it's not always right but it's always got something to say and whenever you're faced

154
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,620
with a decision or a choice it's like this there's a whole supercomputer just sitting there

155
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,759
willing to give you a bit of a kick along if you want to have a listen you don't have to

156
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,559
take it on but if why waste that you know does that make sense luke it does yeah absolutely

157
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,039
resonates with me i think all the best decisions i've ever made in my life

158
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,460
and have always been on this deeper sense isn't it you don't know why but when you're

159
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,700
compelled to do something or the best work choices or you know desperate as a young

160
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,179
kid growing up to play sport for a living and you really could feel that you know tapping in and

161
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,259
then you know likewise the work in the media was coming from a really place i couldn't even

162
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:09,559
describe that i wanted to do it you know there was some links to my dad and and the work that

163
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,279
he did as well but you're right i think it feels like a lost art though steve i feel like there's

164
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,759
now and so much distraction from our phones and so much direct distraction from content we've

165
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,580
it's a timely reminder that that's there and it's not always right but it's not a bad place to start

166
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,600
yes and you're right it does you do have to kind of go quiet for a minute or so just to listen to

167
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,179
it and and if people are listening it the way you do it is you just go down the middle of your body

168
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,899
and it's it's it's it's kind of it's quite amazing it's called the vegas nerve and it goes right down

169
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,620
from your brain down the front of your body it wraps around your

170
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:51,059
lungs and your heart and down into your intestines and it's very important in sports people as well

171
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:57,879
to have this awareness they're coming back and so so if you go down in your gut there's kind of like

172
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,720
little movements and twitches and maybe it's contracting a little bit or it's opening up a

173
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,419
little bit it's a bit like the weather there's always some weather down there and if you just

174
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,059
listen to it you think oh you know i'm just talking to this person who's got this business

175
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:21,559
um something in my stomach just turned over sideways down there and i don't know what that

176
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,240
is but i don't think i'm going to sign on this dotted line right now you know and and you go

177
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,399
away and you have a think about it and after a couple of hours it just comes to you you know

178
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,639
this doesn't add up you know if i look at this and this but the thing is your super sense is already

179
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,779
there it knows it and and and then you you know like when you chose to move into doing media work

180
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:51,279
you go and you do your homework and you go and you get the information um but in your heart you

181
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,700
already knew that was what you were going to do and and the two things together is what makes you

182
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,580
strong yeah and i love the link to something else that you've also uh written in the book

183
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,600
there's a line that really jumped out at me and it's i'll read it back the idea that a lack of

184
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,840
self-awareness is the most crippling disability a human can have and i the question for me

185
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,879
on the back of that is can you learn self-awareness oh yes

186
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:21,059
um i mean it's it put it bluntly if assholes just don't know that they're assholes you know

187
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:28,299
otherwise they just wouldn't be and um um and we've done a lot of work in men's groups and um

188
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:34,460
and this idea when i wrote a book called manhood about maybe nearly 20 years ago now but still

189
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:41,399
around and one of the ideas in the book was you need a men's group um and it's not um you it might

190
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,039
include your regular mates but um it's kind of a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a

191
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:52,120
a place where you just talk honestly about your life and you talk from the heart and after some of

192
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,360
the men's groups that started from a result of that book are still going now people have been

193
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,820
meeting like once a week or once a fortnight with the same guys for for 20 years and so given how

194
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,580
busy we all are they must be getting something out of it and i think what it is is that people

195
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,820
talk straight and they'll say things to you and and and you'll just kind of like

196
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:21,320
burn with you know that's not true you know and they'll sort of sit and wait until you say is it

197
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,820
you know am i am i that bad and they'll say well you look you're on your fourth marriage you know

198
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,120
we we've met several of those wives they seem pretty all right to us you know maybe the problem

199
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,159
is you mervin you know and um and we can of course we can we can learn and otherwise where would you

200
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,820
be and and i'm i was lucky i i was quite socially challenged as a

201
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:52,120
as a kid i i'm quite a long way along the autism spectrum and i'm i married someone who was very

202
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,220
warm-hearted and if if if you're a bit autistic not very good in the heart department and you

203
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,539
marry someone who's very kind and and emotionally intelligent so it's a great team and and now

204
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:11,220
my wife's name is sharon and it's like she's in my head the whole time and even if i go against

205
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,000
what she would recommend i'm acutely aware you know i'm on my

206
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:22,879
own you know i'm out on the on thin ice and um and so i learned early on that i was quite often

207
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:29,559
my judgment as a dad was often wrong um and she would tell me as soon as we got home or we got to

208
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,440
somewhere you know she didn't embarrass me in the middle of it all but she'd say you know you really

209
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,000
got that wrong you know you were you were talking too loud you know and it wasn't their fault or

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,019
something like that and i just decided not to bother with being an ego you know part of

211
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:50,159
jumps up to say you know that's not true they just you know don't give me that i just learned

212
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:57,940
to not do that because i'd rather be a happy idiot than a one that just stuffs up all the time

213
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:04,259
and it is a bit hard to take feedback but it's just so much easier and then you know this is

214
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:09,299
this podcast is about leadership and if you're a good leader you'll listen to your team you know

215
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,039
and and you you hire the best people you hire people smarter than you and and then you listen

216
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,920
to them so much for me to jump into there steven i want to come back to uh to the autism spectrum

217
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,920
with you in a moment and and also you know your 42 year i think plus relationship with uh with

218
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,059
sharon and and that conversation has come up a lot a lot of the ladies we speak to talk about

219
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,180
feedback as a gift you know and giving and receiving feedback as a gift sally cap the lord

220
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,339
mayor of melbourne i think that was exactly her quote you know to give it as a gift to receive

221
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:44,900
it is a gift even though we often squirm and don't like it but i think just picking up on part of what

222
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,819
you said and on the book manhood and the influence that had on men's groups what a great legacy for a

223
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,759
start but also i think part of your life work feels have been around the topic of of getting

224
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,759
masculinity right and and you know there's another great line that you have for the world to survive

225
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,680
we need to get masculinity right and uh you also you know shared a really another personal story

226
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,819
that i thought was irrelevant of a friend growing up who who took their own life can you can you

227
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,019
speak about that in the context of masculinity and what you feel we need to do i've had a

228
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:21,460
a very useful kind of life experience because i work with large groups of people nearly all the

229
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:29,220
time so i would often find myself with about 200 mums for the day running a seminar with 200 women

230
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:36,099
and there was a thing i would do i'd ask them to um design the perfect man and usually i do

231
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:43,980
this straight after lunch and and they'd be a bit sort of sort of buzzy and and um and and i say

232
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,599
got a big whiteboard here you call out the qualities of the perfect man and there'd be the

233
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:57,099
couple of ribald comments to start with you have to get those out of the way um but then they would

234
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:04,160
get very earnest and and they start calling out things like you know kind and loving and open

235
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:13,140
hearted and reliable and trustworthy and strong and you could tell in look in the way that they

236
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,180
were speaking out

237
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,339
and looking at people's faces that they were describing some of the things that they didn't

238
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:25,319
have in the men in their life you know a woman says reliable you know like that's an issue for

239
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,859
her and i'd cover the board with these and then i'd do this trick which i was they were the words

240
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:37,039
were coming i was putting some on the left and some on the right side of the board without

241
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:45,039
explaining why and what it was was that actually there are two completely separate groups

242
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:51,740
qualities so loving and kind and patient and fun those are kind of what you could call heart

243
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:58,319
qualities um it definitely you know everyone wants the men around them to have a good heart

244
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:07,440
but that isn't enough you also need the backbone qualities and by backbone you mean true to their

245
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,460
word they'll hang in when it gets tough you know if the wife gets gets sick and struggles with

246
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,039
health for a year you know if the wife gets sick and struggles with health for a year you know

247
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:20,140
or so he doesn't just bugger off with somebody else and if they say they'll do something they do

248
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,200
it and so you have to have a heart and backbone and if you if people listening to this um if you

249
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,559
think of the men you know you'll know some men who've got loads of heart really warm really

250
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,880
affectionate just can't count on them you know maybe it's a problem with alcohol or something

251
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,519
but they just they're not staunch and and there'll be men who are very strong and very trustworthy

252
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,640
but they're just boring as whatever because they can't talk about their feelings and and

253
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,400
they don't kind of get close to their kids and things like that and so it's the combination

254
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,240
that works i was always warm but i had to learn backbone 1950 style of man which is still around

255
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,019
um often running large organizations emotionally their wives would tell me this and she said he's

256
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,460
a good man you know but you can hear in that tone he was a good man

257
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:21,779
but you know it's like being married to a log of wood he's got no spark and um you know it's going

258
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:28,140
to bed with a log of wood it's not much fun and so the kind of masculinity that we're wanting to build

259
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,579
today and which is you know i can see in you and in your generation there's no doubt of this

260
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:39,619
um you're affectionate if you if you're sad you'll say i'm sad if you're scared you say

261
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:43,519
jeez i was scared you know remember that that surfer that was nearly

262
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,700
shark a couple of years ago forget his name mick fanning yeah i mean that's right mick and

263
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,099
um and his mates were like running into the water and they interviewed one of his when

264
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:58,900
he finally came into view again and he was still on his board his best friend said oh you know

265
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,960
jeez i was just i was scared witless you know i've lost my mate yeah and he just said that

266
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,980
straight to camera 30 years ago he wouldn't have done that he wouldn't have admitted that he had

267
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,660
you know that he loved his his best mate and what you know was scared for him

268
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:22,700
and so that kind of man is the reason that's good is that the feelings are out there and they're

269
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,059
gone and this is one of the things in the new book that emotions are meant to be out there and they

270
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:33,960
go um if they don't you know and this is why we hate it when people used to get redeployed to

271
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,539
afghanistan and things like that is it adds up and you get this cumulative backlog of emotion

272
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:44,480
and that's the kind of man who who one day

273
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,680
just just explodes and there'll be people listening to this who had a dad like that he would

274
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,859
he would build up over weeks and weeks and weeks of frustration with things and then he would just

275
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:04,240
blow and we know punch walls and hit people and and and it's just terrifying and so the reason

276
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,180
we want open-heartedness is so that you know where you stand and it's no big drama you know

277
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,960
everyone's sad because grandma died and everyone's just sad and gradually come out of that and it's

278
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,720
not it's just normal it's does that make sense yeah absolutely it's a great story of of backbone

279
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,640
and heart isn't it the mick fanning story as you said it's your mates jumping in and swing towards

280
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,539
a shark to save your mate without even thinking about it but at the same time being able to say

281
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:37,779
i was terrified you know and and you're right it's it was when you think of it in that way it uh it

282
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,160
is a great story and and and you're right i'm

283
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,000
i think our generation have learned that not small part to some of your thoughts i think as

284
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,420
well and now it's expected steve now that the the landscapes change you know for males and area it's

285
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,920
it's uh if you're not hands-on and you're not you know maybe i'm being a bit naive in the circles

286
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,579
that perhaps i talk about and perhaps it is naive because i did maybe want to jump from there

287
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,079
to another incredible study that that really had a profound effect on me when i when i read it

288
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:10,019
steve and and you talked about a study in the 1990s from u.s health insurer and and an amazing

289
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:10,140
way of doing that and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

290
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,960
link between adverse child experiences which i think you probably need to explain just how

291
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,519
significant they are at some level and then health outcomes for life and look i was shocked

292
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,440
really to to hear that sort of evidence it's uh a profound uh a profound study can you share it

293
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,880
with us yes this is something that i was blown away by when i came across it it's now quite

294
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,920
well known in psychology that the kaiser health insurance company is an enormous health insurance

295
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,220
company in this i think it's probably the biggest and they set up some some weight loss programs

296
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,720
across the country because they want if people lose weight they stay fit and then they don't

297
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,420
need healthy they don't need all these health bills and so they enrolled tens of thousands of

298
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:01,619
people and then about half the people had dropped out of the program after about a month and so it

299
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,660
was a multi-million dollar program and it looked like it was failing nobody was staying the distance

300
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,779
and so they did a survey of

301
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,859
the people who dropped out and because it was anonymous and just maybe because the people

302
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:20,119
doing the study just thought let's have a go at this they asked them a lot of questions like

303
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:26,920
um were you ever sexually abused as a child and and and things like that or did you know did you

304
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,460
have a parent who died or a dad did you know did anyone drink did anyone commit suicide in your

305
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:39,759
family pretty personal questions they discovered a very high correlation of child sexual abuse

306
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:45,539
i forget the exact incidence but in that population it was something like 60 of the people

307
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:53,500
and now about this time i was working training psychologists uh here in tasmania in the in the

308
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,500
1980s and 90s and we were discovering the same thing that amongst our trainees probably two

309
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,960
thirds of the women and maybe a quarter of the men had been and these were people who were

310
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,700
qualified social workers and psychiatrists and things like that had been sexually abused

311
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:18,059
as children and so this very widespread thing and and so they created this scale there's these 10

312
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,460
questions and they're in the book and it's really good to go through the scale did people hit you

313
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,819
when you were growing up um were you were you ever neglected like you didn't have enough to eat or

314
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:35,519
warm clothes and things did anyone go to prison in your family um and so pretty severe things

315
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,599
and 60 of everyone in the normal population

316
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:47,759
is one of those um and something like 38 has got two of those now those are quite severe things

317
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,259
and so what we say in the book is basically being having a traumatic childhood

318
00:26:52,259 --> 00:27:00,859
is normal and we were so bad at parenting in the 20th century families were so hammered by all the

319
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:08,279
wars and everything a normal happy relaxed childhood is really unusual and my wife sharon

320
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,400
had four

321
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,200
had four of those 10 items in her family and um and what they were interested in was of course

322
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,640
there was terrible health consequences of that people tended to get cancer three times more

323
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,200
likely in that category um now some of that was smoking and drinking but even when they

324
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,400
controlled for that it was just the sheer kind of long-term stress that was written into their

325
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,279
bodies yeah what what uh you know horrific data to extract and i suppose uh as you said the lifelong

326
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:39,759
health consequences of that were terrible health consequences of that people tended to get cancer

327
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:45,720
and again it leads to me using that lens through through parenting and you know you've written

328
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,700
you know so many books about raising boys raising girls i suppose it's a it's a simple question that

329
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,559
may not be that easy to answer on the back of last time i spoke to you i spoke to you about

330
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,599
parenting guilt for me which is trying to get the balance right wanting to be around and maybe being

331
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,680
at work longer than you expected and you missed the kids one night and you said let yourself off

332
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,099
the hook you know that the fact that you care and think about that is actually you know a positive

333
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:14,680
you know you're saying that's actually uncommon in some ways in the in the past what is the art of

334
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,740
being a good parent then in your mind the one that that we've already been talking about which is

335
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:28,880
kids have this built-in thing that the the right side of their brain is organized to read facial

336
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:37,140
expressions and even a little baby newborn prem baby in a in a humidity crib they study a little

337
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,759
premature baby mom and dad come to look in through the window and they're like oh my god i'm going to

338
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,599
the glass you can picture that moment they're like this fish tank with a little kitty in the

339
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,579
middle and mom and dad looking either side they and they track the baby's eye movements

340
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:55,119
the baby looks from mom's face to dad's face back to mom's face again what's it doing it's

341
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:01,940
picking up the emotional tone of the of the adults you know we say a baby doesn't care if

342
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:09,640
they're born in a a mansion or in a tin hut they don't care about that but they really care about

343
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,279
is mom and dad love each other and mom and dad love me because that's what their survival depends

344
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:25,220
on and so so they read our faces and if if we're my daughter used to say my daughter's a young

345
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:33,440
professional now but when she was a teenager she would say where are you you know you you your

346
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,519
body's here where's your brain because she was very sensitive to the fact that i i was a stressed

347
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:48,119
out you know rush about sort of guy and and so i'd be you know it's kind of you're right quality

348
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,180
time with kids you know this terrible illusion we have this you're right we'll do quality time now

349
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:58,660
you know um my brain's sort of caught back with something that went wrong earlier in the day and

350
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,559
something someone said on social media or something i had to do in a couple of days time and i wasn't

351
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,720
present and present you know you didn't this is how

352
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:15,259
this is what love is you know you know someone loves you when you have their absolute full

353
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:21,619
attention and the trick of this is very interesting this is why i wrote fully human all around this

354
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:30,500
topic that you can't be present with someone else unless you're present with yourself and so the

355
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:38,680
first step is going down the middle of your body checking out where am i at you know and what that

356
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,740
will do is it'll come

357
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:49,220
you down or or it'll make you notice how you're not calm like we have a a reflex um luke that was

358
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:56,140
comes from when the from the stone age which was our main enemies when we were kind of big apes

359
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:03,000
getting around was animals that would go for the jugular you know there would be tiger cats and

360
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,460
whatever and they would always go for the neck because that's the best place you're going to

361
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,740
bring down a prey animal you grab them by the by the

362
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,980
neck so we have a reflex where our shoulders come up around our side of our neck people

363
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,579
this thing can't see this but your picture your shoulders come up around your ears like that and

364
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:27,680
that's a stress reaction and so if if you're stressed you're most often you'll feel it in

365
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,819
your shoulders and in fact your shoulders will start to ride higher and higher up

366
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:35,180
sort of like you're going to try and block your ears with your shoulders and if you if you check

367
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,599
out your body you know say you get home and you're sitting down with your kids you go

368
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,440
down in your body even in the car just walking up the driveway and you'll notice wow you know

369
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,720
my shoulders are really uptight and and my my breathing's really fast and and as you notice

370
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,480
that this is the beautiful thing about it will automatically start to self-regulate

371
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,460
and even hear me then just do a breath as i thought about it you know like ah

372
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:08,420
and and you'll start to calm down and so when you look in your kids eyes they'll see dad's really in

373
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,740
there you know and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

374
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:17,420
the lights are on the occupant is home and so they'll feel calmed down by your presence and

375
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:24,099
that you that they're a priority for you that's all you have to do you know and the next thing

376
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:28,660
they'll be wanting to play in the backyard or they'll be wanting to tell you that something

377
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:36,380
happened at school but you're already there they feel loved they feel attended to um and we're in

378
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,579
society that wants to steal our time

379
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,819
to get you know we don't have to fight tiger cats anymore we got to get our sword or our spear and

380
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:55,380
fight off time thieves yeah so many great stories to tell us thinking of a study quite another quite

381
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,900
horrific state i think in the 1920s in an orphanage where they did that experiment with

382
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,839
babies that they hugged and cared for and looked in the eyes and gave attention to and the other

383
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,539
group they literally didn't look at they fed them they kept them warm and they put them back

384
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:09,720
down and they were able to get them back and they were able to get them back and they were able to

385
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,359
but gave no attention and no and those babies literally started to die within a within a few

386
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:21,519
years it was that dramatic that clearly they had to stop the experiment but it was weeks before

387
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,720
you know as you said the survival depends on on that that love and that attention which we all

388
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,319
get distracted from don't we in our lives we're there but we're sitting on our phone or we're

389
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,359
sitting next to one of our kids but we're not you know being present as you said it was a

390
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:46,230
great way to break it down there's another passage that i

391
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,130
i loved and i just loved but also wanted to get your thoughts on and i might read it back to you

392
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:56,250
if that's okay um to look at the basic facts you're right the 40 rate of marriage breakdowns

393
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,450
the seemingly intractable problem of family violence the recent epidemic of anxiety in young

394
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,509
people growing suicide problem even among prosperous and successful people all these

395
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:10,449
things shout to us that something is amiss if only one in 50 people had a psychiatric illness

396
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,750
it would be plausible to blame your brain or a chemical imbalance balance but the figure is one

397
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,710
in five or more

398
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,849
we have to look at other explanations that the problem is not with our brain or our bodies but

399
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:27,929
the way we live so what is the problem steve with the way that we live okay well i think

400
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:35,469
there's a couple of things and and this is on my website i put this like a banner across the top

401
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:45,469
this quote that um that hurry is the enemy of love and that when we're rushing say if you're

402
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,210
in a family or if you're in a family and you're in a family and you're in a family and you're

403
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,289
working as a team or even if it's an organization and people working as a team

404
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:57,989
if you're in a hurry then the little fine-tuned connections don't quite work um you but if it's

405
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:03,210
a family say anyone of your kids says something and and there isn't really time to pick up on

406
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,969
what they said it sets off a little something ticking in your body but you there wasn't time

407
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:12,230
to follow it up you know and then next time you see them it's you know it's not quite the

408
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,110
opportunity and and then six months down the track there's this

409
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,590
huge problem that happens with them because let's say they've punched somebody at school

410
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,969
or stolen something or um in trouble with with the police or something like that and

411
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:34,650
it turns out that that's made up of you know 20 little missed opportunities and so you know the

412
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:40,030
big nightmare for corporate parents and a lot of parents listening to this is is very high

413
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:46,070
incidence of drug addiction and drug abuse in affluent um kids um and there's only one

414
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:52,630
of um drug addiction that we know of one one risk factor that holds up and it's got nothing to do

415
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:58,110
with income nothing to do with which suburb you live in or who your friends are it's lack of

416
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:05,550
parental time and so we work hard you know to send our kids to good schools or to to have

417
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,070
opportunities and take them on fantastic holidays and get them good teeth you know and things like

418
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:16,070
that um if that all doesn't really stand up very well if they end up in a in a

419
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:25,030
house somewhere or or taking heroin down the cross or something and so in term in sheer investment

420
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,929
terms it is better if you know once a week you take your teenage daughter out for a coffee

421
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:36,090
and you know on a sunday morning and have have pancakes and coffee and have a chat to her

422
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:45,989
that you and your son go camping or vice versa these and and um and have the time to unpack

423
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,050
um how are we going husbands and wives have these conversations how are we going that is is is our

424
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,690
life the way we planned it now there's a single example of this i really love because i always

425
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:05,449
i was aware of the brevity of time which is that tens of thousands of people read in one of my

426
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:12,030
books the idea of taking a year off and going around australia in a four-wheel drive that

427
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,769
the middle part of high school is a complete waste of time

428
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:23,550
kids and i have this on on the authority of seriously important school principals

429
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:30,969
mid-secondary school is a waste of time but even if they're in primary it's it's um take a year

430
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:37,230
off as a family and go and do something so you have so you and you'll put your family back

431
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:43,130
together again that will become the year that everyone looks back on as being magic when we

432
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,909
went to the you know we went to ningaloo you know and we

433
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:52,889
um we got bogged at uluru and and you know we went to tassie and nearly froze to death and

434
00:37:52,889 --> 00:38:01,050
and the kids will just they just love that stuff no structure mom and dad hanging about you know

435
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:08,329
reading harry potter to each other in the by a candlelight um this is what families are made for

436
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:14,150
we're not made for we're not a money-making house building machine we're we're there to create

437
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,210
memories of absolute joy and we're not made for we're not made for we're not made for

438
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,809
and so so when we're gone i mean you're one of the fittest men in australia luke so this isn't

439
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:29,289
and you're in you've got probably 60 years ahead of you um but but i'm i'm getting on a bit and so

440
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:36,250
i'm thinking you know when i'm gone i want my kids to smile when they remember me big smile you know

441
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,550
and and have really specific memories when we and dad did this and me and dad did that

442
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,989
and that they feel deep down this sense of peace when they think of of

443
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:53,789
me and their mom and so we can we can give them that is in their muscles and nerves of their body

444
00:38:53,789 --> 00:39:03,090
the feeling of being peaceful and content even in you know hardship and struggle um yeah so

445
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:08,590
thanks that's a great question thank you well it's a great answer and i was thinking of uh

446
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,190
one of my really close friends who actually interviewed in the podcast uh craig ellis who's

447
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,110
gone on to found the extraordinary business circle

448
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,570
triangle but uh him and i were great mates from sport from the age of eight and his family did

449
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,429
that year you talked about they him and his two brothers and they went around australia as both

450
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:30,449
his parents were school teachers i think i heard every i felt like i did that year he spoke about

451
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:34,889
it so often all the way through to this day it had that big an impact on him and he's got this

452
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:40,369
great sense of curiosity and adventure and travel all built on the back of uh you know that brilliant

453
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:46,190
experience as you said so you might have inspired uh that family as well i think uh from times go

454
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,289
past i heard you pick up and and in the book also you talk about you identifying as being on the

455
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:57,269
autism spectrum and it seems to me steve to be something that i hear that a lot more i've got

456
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:03,190
lots of people around me uh it's a word we know a lot more about now and it is a broad spectrum i

457
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:09,210
think sometimes severely misunderstood steve you think of and and clearly at the at the really

458
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:14,889
traumatic end there's there's families that have kids to function daily is a real challenge but a

459
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:16,210
lot of the families and the kids and that i've been talking to for a long time have been

460
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:22,289
growing up seem to have a part of their brain turned on a bit like you in a really unique way

461
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:28,369
that has this incredible empathy and this incredible caring nature i mean at what age did

462
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:33,110
you realize that that you were on the spectrum somewhere and can you relate to what i'm saying

463
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,650
i know it's harder than just that but it feels as though we've misunderstood this thing called

464
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,750
the autism spectrum and if we do more there's a genius there as well is that is that a fair thing

465
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,190
yes it is to answer that

466
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:54,250
i was i wasn't diagnosed till i was in my mid-50s and um and it was just like a like a whoa

467
00:40:54,250 --> 00:41:02,670
that explains everything you know from um being a little kid in school to um just because what it

468
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,489
was was just not knowing how to read the signals and i joke about i said there was a lot of really

469
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:12,610
nice girls who went unkissed because because i just didn't i just wasn't reading the signs you

470
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,210
know and um um and my wife says that's

471
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:26,730
it's a very good thing um but it's hard and it's it was tough and and the human race felt like it

472
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:32,829
was a place where you didn't belong and so it's brilliant that this is now recognized um people

473
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:37,710
come up to me after talks and say i'm so thankful that you that you'd said you know kind of

474
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:45,190
identified as autistic because we've got a kid and you know we worry about them and so on and

475
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:54,789
the good thing about it is that i think the human race is diverse for a reason that we had to you

476
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:00,150
know the stone age was a tough place and we and we were there for half a million years and we were

477
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:06,130
actually very good at surviving and working in teams um human human beings lived in groups of

478
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:12,650
about 25 people who all loved each other and someone who's on the spectrum is very useful

479
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,070
because they they they don't have a herd instinct

480
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:23,730
and so everyone else will just go along with something because kind of it's a bit of a herd

481
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,429
thing and the person who's autistic will say wait a minute is that even a good idea um

482
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:34,889
um the famous um autistic woman whose name eludes me she said if it wasn't for

483
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:40,030
us aspies human beings would still be living in caves talking about their feelings

484
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:45,929
it's it's a hospital who said you know what about disease you know what about now why don't we build

485
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:52,809
a shelter here you know and there's other ways to do it and so um i like neurotypical people

486
00:42:52,809 --> 00:43:00,010
and um and i've learned to join in i can be in front of 800 people in a room and i know everyone

487
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,869
in the room is that emotionally i can do that you know i've jumped over normal but i still take me

488
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,869
out of my comfort zone and i'm very awkward if i'm at a party i have to go and have a little

489
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:16,170
quiet lie down after about 20 minutes it's just too much you know um

490
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,570
i can do it but it's hard work and i think my kids would have often said i just i wish we had

491
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:27,750
a normal dad sometimes because i you know i was just learning as i went the gift in that

492
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:33,789
was i was writing books as i went you know when i figured something out i'd write it down i'd put

493
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:39,849
it into a framework and and the new book the fully human book is really my life framework

494
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:46,130
for the whole business of being a human being and i had to do that because i needed a manual myself

495
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:52,750
lots of people go pretty well but if they suddenly lose the plot they're at they're

496
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:59,530
completely at sea and that's where we whereas aspies can maybe be of help yeah before i uh i

497
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,190
go through um some questions that i've been wanting to ask and have been asking a range of

498
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,230
leaders and and your leadership in the in the space of of parenting in the space of raising

499
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:15,130
children is worldwide uh legacy that i'm sure you're incredibly proud of and i want to get

500
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,030
to that but just

501
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,989
something you said before you've jumped over normal in a room of 800 you just said that you

502
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:25,409
can pick up the feelings of almost all those people individually what what did you mean by

503
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:31,869
that did i get that right yes i well doing shows became very organized i had the best i had the

504
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:37,010
best sound engineer in australia um helping me to with my with the sound equipment of my shows and

505
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,630
things like that and we would always set up the theater with the lighting so that i could see

506
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,210
every face in the room and we would never go over 800 people because that was my

507
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:52,789
maximum um you can't see you can't see further than that um without binoculars or something

508
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:58,909
and so i could i just would notice who was struggling um in in the the raising boys talk

509
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:05,130
which we still now do online and people um schools get it online instead as a recording

510
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:12,309
there's always one or two people crying in the room and the stories are powerful and um people

511
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,690
used to get up and leave from that talk and

512
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,769
i think oh and it was always men and i think oh they're just sick of it or they've you know got a

513
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:26,329
meeting or their phones rung um but i talked to the ushers at the back of the theater afterwards

514
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,489
and saying you know the three guys left you know what was going on and say they say yeah he was

515
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:37,429
he was bawling and and i thought well that's you want to touch people but you don't want them have

516
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:45,630
to leave the show you know that's not a very good result so we put a lot more jokes in and a lot

517
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,210
more you know a lot more jokes in and a lot more jokes in and a lot more jokes in and a lot more

518
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:52,630
you know you get to a tough spot we just turn it around make it funny again um so that people

519
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,030
could handle it but you're doing group therapy with 800 people and you have to look after them

520
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:04,250
and i learned from people who are wonderful at that and they and they they it's it's about caring

521
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:10,050
you care about everyone in the room um and you try you know with eye contact and just like a

522
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,329
tilt of the head in their direction to say is this making sense to you you know and and um and you

523
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:22,849
an audience home and I know people listening who lead us I don't know how to lead a big

524
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:27,650
organization but I'm just wondering if that's possible that you if how would every person

525
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:32,329
there feel like you cared about them and that you saw them you know that you literally saw them

526
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:36,429
yeah that's a it's an interesting thing you say Steve we we hear from a lot of the sporting

527
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:42,150
coaches that that is a language that the the 21st century coaches are using now to say

528
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,789
I ought to find something in these players who can frustrate me and let me down sometimes

529
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:51,889
something in them all that I love literally that wasn't a language our coaches used in the era that

530
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:57,250
I played they were a touch more direct than that so they're talking and some of the coaches go

531
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,170
around at the start of the day and make sure they physically make physical contact with everyone in

532
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,550
the organization I know that's one of your passions as well Steve is that idea of touch

533
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,809
means an enormous amount to the health and particularly when you've got alpha males in

534
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:11,889
sporting environments going around doing it it's a great

535
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:12,130
you

536
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,789
new chapter of new of new leadership so Steve what I wanted to ask you we've we've got this

537
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:22,409
thought some of the work we're doing in business I'm in and passionate about and we teach school

538
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:27,130
teachers around collaboration and connection and leadership and we're seeing through the work at

539
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,929
Aleda a lot of consistencies in what makes great leadership and to have someone like you who's

540
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:39,190
spent his life in this space of parenting and raising children specifically and other areas

541
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,090
as well combined with other people in sport and corporate so

542
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,349
you know take as much time and I want to ask a range of questions on leadership and I'm

543
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:51,530
interested to get your thoughts and the first one is around self-leadership what do you think of when

544
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:58,989
I ask you about self-leadership yeah I think that there's a concept in the in the fully human book

545
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:05,710
of what's called the four-story mansion and in a absolute brief form it's the fact that

546
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:11,750
human beings have got levels to them or layers to them we've got our body we've got our emotions

547
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:21,309
got our thoughts, we've got our kind of antenna out into the cosmos. And those layers are very

548
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:27,690
often at odds with each other so that what we're doing isn't what we really think we want to be

549
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:35,869
doing or we really feel right about. We teach people in the book to just shuttle between the

550
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:40,329
levels, you know, go down in your body, check it out, come up to your feelings and check it out,

551
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:45,570
go up to your thinking and so on. And what you'll notice when you do that, it's like you've

552
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:52,590
suddenly turned on all the lights inside the building of your mind. And the disconnections

553
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:59,050
will start to be kind of glaring. And so, I'll ask my audiences, I'll say, you know,

554
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:04,610
does your life stack up? You know, do these layers stack up? And they'll start to realize, look,

555
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,869
you know, there's a whole thing I'm doing, which I don't want to do anymore.

556
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:16,150
A friend I've got who's not a friend, or I'm never going to take my child to that carer again.

557
00:49:17,409 --> 00:49:25,690
And it comes from turning the lights on. And so, after a while, you know, there are people who

558
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:32,230
every layer of them stacks up. They're doing what they feel like, think is right, and sits

559
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:38,050
comfortably in their skin, and even spiritually kind of fits with their view of why we're in this

560
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,449
world.

561
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:48,010
People are outstanding. If that person walks into a room, everyone on some level is aware of them.

562
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:55,869
They stack up. And they don't have to lead in a sense of motivating people, because people just

563
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:01,750
want to be like them. You know, it's like, can I hang around with you? And you'll hear that about

564
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:09,110
some teachers and some school principals, people, you know, and some matrons of hospitals, people,

565
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,309
they want to work in your hospital.

566
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:18,010
You know, how do I do it? I want to teach in your school. We have an automatic radar. A little

567
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:29,550
one-year-old child can tell a person with integrity. A dog can tell. And so, it's, yeah,

568
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:31,010
stack yourself up.

569
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,590
Brilliant analogy, Steve. I love the idea of the four-story mansion. I'm glad you brought it up.

570
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,650
And it is the two key ideas you touch on. We touched on super sense and the four-story

571
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:39,969
mansion.

572
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:45,190
I think to use your own words again, just to briefly describe the way you gave it in the

573
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,690
book, an easily grasped way of navigating the multiple levels of your mind, getting the work

574
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:54,269
together instead of, as they often do, tearing you apart. The idea is so simple. It can be learned

575
00:50:54,269 --> 00:51:00,650
by a five-year-old, so profound that it can help even the most damaged adult. And you really do

576
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,949
need to purchase the four-story mansion and, sorry, purchase a fully human, understand the

577
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:10,269
four-story mansion, because it is, it's a profound way of thinking in a really crystal,

578
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:15,969
clear way. And it certainly resonated with me in a profound way on self-leadership. It does feel

579
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:21,510
like the combination of your life's work. The second part for me was about your thoughts on

580
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,090
positively impacting others in your environment. How do you go about doing that, Steve?

581
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:34,110
Gosh, I think, again, it's like your attention is the most valuable thing you can give.

582
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:40,289
Everyone's struggling. People get really shocked, you know, when I wrote in the book about the

583
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:45,369
struggles that I'd had, you know, when my friend committed suicide and that you've referred to

584
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:52,929
before and things like that. Assume that everyone around you is struggling and that they would

585
00:51:52,929 --> 00:52:01,469
benefit from some quiet time and some attention. And even on a non-verbal level, the fact that

586
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:07,230
you check in with them, that at least you're not causing any problems to them, you know.

587
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,929
So you can ask that question. You can say, look, am I doing,

588
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:16,530
am I doing what you need me to do as a boss? Am I the kind of dad you need me to be? You know,

589
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,690
you have a teenage daughter and she's doing a few things you're not happy with.

590
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:27,469
You know, choose your moment. It's a lot to do with the timing. Choose a moment where if this

591
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:31,949
is deep water, you can go to deep water, you know, so you don't ask it as you go out the door.

592
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:39,389
You know, you and her sitting in the rain because the game's been cancelled or something like that.

593
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:45,389
And say to her, I'm not sure that I'm being the kind of father you need me to be.

594
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:53,090
And she'd probably be really shocked. And it might take her a while to come back to that.

595
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:58,989
Or she might have a list. Yeah, you're right. I've got a list. And then it's like,

596
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:06,630
you better be ready to hear it. And yeah, we had a story of a girl who went on a holiday with her

597
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,710
dad. And this girl had slept with seven or eight different boys.

598
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:15,130
She's still in high school. She was in terrible shape. And we went on a holiday together. Her dad

599
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:20,769
had enough sense to know, you know, we've got to get away together, have some time. And she just,

600
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:25,750
something came up like a little trigger and she just blew him out of the water with all the times

601
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:31,769
he had failed her, you know, promising to show up for a concert and not showing up and, you know,

602
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:38,610
being rude and getting drunk at a party. And she had a list and there was nothing he could do except

603
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,050
um,

604
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:46,610
to it, you know, and say, you know, you're right. You know, you're, you're, I'm, I'm ashamed and

605
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:54,349
you're right. And I failed you and I want to do better. Um, and kids are very forgiving. People

606
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:58,849
are forgiving. They can handle imperfection. They, they, they know what it's like to be,

607
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:04,030
to struggle so they can handle that. Yeah. What a, what a profound story. I think,

608
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:10,010
you know, with my three boys, I've got three boys and, uh, the oldest is 18, uh, a couple of weeks

609
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:14,210
ago. My daughter's 16. So she's the one girl in the family and it's a, you know, completely

610
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:19,449
different experience as you know, and I've written about and, and you're right. I get direct feedback

611
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:24,610
from Sienna and in a profound way, she knows exactly what she wants and can articulate that.

612
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,730
But those moments when you do get her one-on-one and like, and she's driving at the moment,

613
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:32,030
it's a great chance to be in the car with her because it's just the two of us. And,

614
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:37,130
and you often find that there's an opportunity to have those profound, I can't say I've had that

615
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,849
one quite, but, uh, but that's inspiring.

616
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:45,389
That is a profound way to impact others in your environment. We talk a lot in the leadership

617
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:49,650
space about creating and sharing a vision. Have you got some thoughts on how you've gone about

618
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:58,269
that? I think this is, um, perhaps the only thing that, um, that's your responsibility as a leader

619
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:04,010
is, is I know when we built the, when we built the refugee Memorial in Canberra, uh, it took about

620
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:10,250
five years and it was, uh, um, seven or eight people who worked on it that whole time.

621
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:16,889
And, and we, Sharon and I funded it. And so we had one staff person, um, and they're everyone

622
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:21,369
else's volunteers and they were, they're all wonderful. And, and as I said, they were all

623
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:28,929
smarter than me in different ways, but my job was to, to remember why we were doing it. Um,

624
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:37,630
which was to, um, to honor the lives of 350 people who drowned in a boat and the boat,

625
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,769
it was 20 years ago that this boat set sail.

626
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:44,590
Mostly women and children. And they were on the boat because we had their husbands

627
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:51,789
in Australia and we wouldn't let them reunite their very cruel policy about that. And I wanted

628
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:56,710
Australia to see what 350 lives look like, because if they died in a jumbo jet crash,

629
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:04,369
that would have been a big deal. But anonymous refugees in a boat sailing to Australia was not

630
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:08,949
much news after a couple of days. And I, I would, I was really angry about that. I wasn't going to

631
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,309
let that go by.

632
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:19,269
And so the vision was we are going to make an honoring of those lives. And so when we had to

633
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:23,590
fight the government over building this memorial, I said, I don't care. You know, if we fight the

634
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,889
government, we'll be in the headlines and the people will be remembered. You know, if John

635
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:33,530
Howard doesn't let us do it, um, that'll be that memorial. You know, the government was too ashamed

636
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:40,269
for us to, to, to honor those names. Um, and by holding the kind of true North,

637
00:56:40,329 --> 00:57:10,030
perhaps a small, you might say,

638
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,090
It doesn't even matter if we fail miserably.

639
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,869
And sometimes I really thought we would.

640
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,710
You know, it was a long struggle.

641
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:19,829
We gave it our best shot.

642
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,969
You know, it's like Bilbo Baggins in Lord of the Rings.

643
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,570
You know, you just did what you could, you know.

644
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:27,949
Yeah, an amazing legacy.

645
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:32,469
164 children drowned in that tragedy, mainly Iraqi and Afghani refugees.

646
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:38,030
And as you said, unfortunately, the news cycle, you move on.

647
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,530
And for you not to allow that to be the case, you know,

648
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,929
you're living a great life and you've got many things you could do.

649
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:49,070
It's an incredible piece of leadership that I know you must have put an

650
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:52,150
enormous amount of not only your own money but your own reputation

651
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,170
and effort behind.

652
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:57,190
So what a profound thing to do, to have that memorial now permanently done.

653
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,050
I know you had to fight for it to be a permanent legacy,

654
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:00,690
but congratulations.

655
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:03,469
Yes, it's right there on the lake shore.

656
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,829
If you go to Canberra, go and visit.

657
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,429
It's a very inspiring place.

658
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:09,489
It's a 300-metre long memorial.

659
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,130
It's just beautiful, yeah.

660
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:16,170
Curiosity is something, another dimension of leadership we talk about, Stephen.

661
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,090
I feel like your mind is incredibly curious.

662
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:19,730
Do you think about that?

663
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,530
And is that in terms of your own learning and your own development,

664
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,710
how do you approach that?

665
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:29,670
Now, these questions assume that I've really sorted out Luke

666
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:33,449
and I don't even know about that except I get this kind

667
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:35,329
of little boy excitement about stuff.

668
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:36,329
I've been learning about the brainwaves.

669
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,210
I've been learning about the brain just lately

670
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,449
and how it's got two completely separate halves

671
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:46,769
and one half focuses on the worm that you want to eat

672
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:48,909
if you're a blackbird or something and the other half

673
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:52,250
of the brain is thinking, yeah, but what if there's a cat

674
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,250
in the bushes, you know?

675
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,090
And so I find this fascinating and so I'm reading all these neuroscience books

676
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:01,210
which are pretty hard to read, but I just want to get

677
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,150
to the bottom of this.

678
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:06,050
And so that's, I think, something that is just a little kid digging

679
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,710
in the garden for worms, you know?

680
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:11,570
It's the same little kid that I was in Yorkshire, you know, in 1953.

681
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:17,309
I'm just playing in the mud and feeling just really happy

682
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:19,610
and looking up at the clouds every now and then.

683
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:23,989
And, yeah, so maybe the message is just enjoy yourself, you know.

684
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:30,150
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, those guys, they were just mucking about,

685
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:35,090
you know, let's see what we can do and look how well it brought us.

686
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:35,389
Yeah.

687
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:36,349
Well said.

688
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,090
And they are questions without notice, Steve, so your answers are profound.

689
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,170
You know, clearly we talk about communication with clarity as well.

690
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,690
Is that something that resonates with you?

691
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:50,750
Clearly through your work you've communicated with millions of people.

692
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:53,590
Is that the way that you communicate effectively?

693
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,949
There's a thing I do with writing.

694
00:59:56,869 --> 01:00:02,469
If someone in the street comes up to me and says one of the books

695
01:00:02,469 --> 01:00:05,369
has helped them, which is one of the nice parts of my work,

696
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:09,530
people come up and they say, you know, your book really helped my husband

697
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,550
or something like that.

698
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:15,409
And the second thing they say is it's a really easy read.

699
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:21,309
And the way I write is a bit like if you're making a table

700
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:22,590
and you're planing the table.

701
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,909
You just keep planing until it's smooth, you know.

702
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:28,289
You just keep sanding until it's smooth and until it's just effortless.

703
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,530
But there's another thing, which is I have a pretty ordinary brain

704
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,050
and so I can't do complicated.

705
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,349
You know.

706
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:38,349
You know, if I could do complicated, I could impress all the academics

707
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:41,429
and, you know, make a fortune and everything.

708
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,349
But it's not.

709
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:44,389
I'm simple because I'm simple.

710
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,610
And the brilliance is in the simplicity, Stephen.

711
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:53,530
It's a great compliment, I think, isn't it, to say maybe it sounds

712
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,510
like a backhanded compliment.

713
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,030
It's a great read and I got it and I understood it because that's how I felt.

714
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,670
So many things I wrote down from Reading Fully Human,

715
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,250
it's exactly how it felt, you know, the way you described it,

716
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,250
which was great.

717
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:08,489
It's brilliant stuff that you could practically apply to your life.

718
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,030
So it's a great school that you've got.

719
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:13,730
I don't think it's – the genius is in the simplicity for me.

720
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,750
The final dimension we talk about is collaboration.

721
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:20,070
And without answering it for you, I'm thinking of –

722
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,789
it seems like an incredible partnership, you and your wife, Sharon.

723
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:25,789
You know, 42 years, I think, I read you've been married.

724
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,690
It seems like that collaboration at home is big.

725
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,789
But do you think about collaboration extensively?

726
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,130
Yeah, I think.

727
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:37,969
I think what characterises it with Sharon is we still sometimes

728
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:42,409
get completely lost and I just don't understand where she's coming from

729
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:46,110
or she thinks I'm completely out of my tree.

730
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:52,289
And the only way we know to deal with that is one way is to take a break

731
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:58,989
if we're like just can't get it right, have a bit of space.

732
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:01,989
But the other way is to kind of come back and just keep talking.

733
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,869
And sometimes we often drive to Hobart.

734
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,630
We're in Launceston.

735
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,349
We drive to Hobart.

736
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,230
So it's nearly three hours from where we are.

737
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,889
Most of our great conversations have been on that journey

738
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:16,730
because three hours is about what it takes to really get down

739
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,650
to the bedrock of something.

740
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,409
That's where we decided to go live in England.

741
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,550
That's where we decided to have a second child.

742
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:28,070
You know, that's where we decided to, you know, that I could use our money

743
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,530
to do different things.

744
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,889
And so collaboration.

745
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,570
It feels like hard work.

746
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:38,869
It's much easier to just look, I'll do it my way.

747
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:39,809
You know, it's easier.

748
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:47,510
But if you want results, two brains are better than one every time.

749
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,769
And so you put the time, you know, teaching, you want to teach your kid

750
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,690
to fasten their laces or how to do the dishes.

751
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:57,690
That's going to take some time.

752
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,570
You know, it's quicker to just do them for them.

753
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:01,570
But.

754
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:07,489
Get a kid that can cook, you know, you're, that's a lifetime, you know,

755
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:09,809
so it's, it's worth a bit of effort early on.

756
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:10,230
Yeah.

757
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,190
And I will said, you know, think about my own home front again,

758
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:17,849
when you say that, you know, the 14 year olds say he's got this passion

759
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:21,690
for, for cooking and self, you know, he's quite amazing and it's,

760
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,329
it's great to see maybe, you know, first, second, third, we start getting

761
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:31,869
it right, maybe by the third or fourth time, but a final question that I've been

762
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:34,809
asking, um, all the leaders that I've been speaking to.

763
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:38,489
And again, a question without notice there, who is the greatest leader

764
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:39,489
that you've had in your life?

765
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:41,369
Okay.

766
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,739
Not when he comes to mind straight away, but I was always impressed with

767
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:52,980
Gandhi, um, because of course I didn't meet and Martin Luther King for the

768
01:03:52,980 --> 01:04:01,719
same sort of reason that, um, they had no enemies, Gandhi said that he, he

769
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:03,159
could kick the British out.

770
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:06,099
Of India because he kind of liked them.

771
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,679
Um, and, and he'd go to England and then there's pictures of him with all these

772
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:17,260
women who wove the cloth in Lancashire and, and this skinny little guy with

773
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,980
this little nappy on, you know, remember the pictures of Gandhi and there's all

774
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,739
these women with their hair in rollers and they're just giggling and carrying

775
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:26,400
on with, with Gandhi, you know, and the next thing he's kicking the British

776
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,139
empire out, but he was absolutely committed.

777
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:30,260
And Bob Brown is the same.

778
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,079
I've talked to Bob Brown about this and.

779
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,239
He doesn't hate anyone.

780
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,380
He just thinks some people a bit, a bit lost, you know, no, I find that really

781
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:45,599
hard, you know, I hate quite a number of Australian prime ministers in, in, in

782
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:51,280
order and, and, and I was a street kid and I was raised on hating and it's hard

783
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,679
to, so I admire those people because they don't hate anyone.

784
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:57,260
They think, look, this person just a bit lost, you know, we can, we'll

785
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,440
bring them around in the end, you know, they'll, they'll get it.

786
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,559
They'll get climate change.

787
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:01,880
They'll get, you know.

788
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:02,920
Whatever it is.

789
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,179
And, and so, so people don't feel the enmity.

790
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,440
Um, it's a bit irresistible when someone won't let you be an enemy.

791
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:12,159
Yeah.

792
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,400
And, and it was going to be the last question, but the followup, you know, to a

793
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,960
Gandhi type leader of, you know, as you said, to, to use peace with that amount

794
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:25,460
of power, with that enemy and the pacifism and, and, and what that did and

795
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:29,320
influenced, you know, followed by, you know, tens and tens and tens of millions

796
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,019
of people, do you have the positive glass?

797
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,599
Half full that the leader will emerge like that?

798
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,719
Is there one around, you said, you know, the frustration with political

799
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:40,239
leadership at the moment is, is that even possible?

800
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:41,079
Do you think going forward?

801
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,599
Look, I don't know.

802
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,320
It's, it feels like it doesn't come from politics that, that politics doesn't, um,

803
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,699
funnel down the right kind of people and push them to the front.

804
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:56,380
Um, so I think what we need is a lot of independence in the next election.

805
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,179
Um, we have some fantastic independence in, in here in Tasmania.

806
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:01,860
Um.

807
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,440
People, and you have on the mainland as well, people who are just in it for

808
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,260
their values, um, not for ambition.

809
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,179
And I, so I think if we're going to be a healthy country, we, we might have, um,

810
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:20,780
couple of dozen independents and they'll vote depending on what's right for the

811
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,420
country, not what's the party line.

812
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,579
And sometimes it'll be this way and sometimes it'll be that way.

813
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:31,000
And so I think the, the dinosaur parties, perhaps the day is done, um, and we'll

814
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,300
have.

815
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,940
We'll vote for people, um, who we actually like, um, you know, that you're glad if you're

816
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,019
glad to see them, if you're glad to see their face on the television, it's a pretty good

817
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:42,360
gauge.

818
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,619
You know, they come on the telly and your heart lifts.

819
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:51,440
Um, that's a, you know, not many who do that at the moment, but there are some who do,

820
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:52,780
and they're mostly independents.

821
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:55,460
Profound way to, uh, to think about that as well.

822
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:58,940
Uh, Steve, uh, as I said, I, I have, there's so many more questions.

823
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,039
Hopefully, uh, we could maybe do this again another time because.

824
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,880
Uh, did promise you that there was a time limit in the interest of your time as well.

825
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,320
So thank you that the book fully human couldn't recommend it anymore.

826
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,480
A new way of using your mind is the full title.

827
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,219
And, uh, it's brilliant.

828
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:19,059
It's a simple genius as, uh, as, uh, Steve gave you a great insight into how he writes

829
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:19,739
and how he thinks.

830
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,079
And, uh, thank you for sharing that on leadership.

831
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,699
You've had such a profound effect on so many, uh, of our generation and how we parent, how

832
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:26,480
we think about it.

833
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,480
Um, and you continue to do that.

834
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,639
It's always a great pleasure to, to speak to you.

835
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:31,460
Thanks for your time again.

836
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,039
Thanks.

837
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:32,840
