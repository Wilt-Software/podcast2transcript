1
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,900
I think first and foremost, it is about turning up for you.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,419
I think there's a lot to learn in all of us trying to lead a balanced life.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,519
I've asked the question, who's got the control panel here?

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,579
Like, I want to control myself right now.

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,699
Yes, you have to understand yourself, but you also have to understand them.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,940
That's why it's important to ask questions.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,899
What a great privilege it has been to sit across from so many inspirational,

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,579
unique, different leaders from diverse backgrounds throughout the year,

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,939
all with their own unique leadership story.

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,240
At Leader, we know that there are consistent dimensions of what great leadership looks like,

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,259
and we'll cover them all across the next seven episodes.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,759
And I'm really keen to start with this idea of self-leadership.

13
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,939
We know it's very difficult to lead others unless you've got a strong sense

14
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:53,920
of what self-leadership means to you and this idea of leading yourself well first.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,359
On every Empowering Leaders episode, we hear from people at the top of their industry,

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,420
whether that be from the world of sport, from business, education, arts, or social venture.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,260
And when it comes to the dimension of self-leadership,

18
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,739
we knew we were sitting on an absolute goldmine of wisdom

19
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,439
from the selection of guests you're about to hear from.

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,400
We have the incredible Andy Kelly, one of Australia's leading music label directors and managers,

21
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,140
and such a fantastic person, Andy, in every sense.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,219
The remarkable Umrah Omar, a Kenyan humanitarian and community conservation strategist,

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,760
and the founder of Safari Doctors, and what an inspiration Umrah is in every sense.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,359
So, right, Eddington joined us.

25
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,040
throughout the year, highly distinguished Australian businessman, community leader,

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,859
former deputy chair of News Limited, and was the CEO of British Airways

27
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:45,959
before moving on to incredible roles across so many different areas.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,939
Let's get started with another inspiration, and that is Hugh Van Kylenburg,

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,120
the founder of the Resilience Project and the Imperfects podcast.

30
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,519
I'm seeing my psychologist once every two weeks at the moment,

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,259
and with the challenges we've got in our family at the moment,

32
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,460
I've been finding really...

33
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,560
really difficult of late, and I've been saying to her,

34
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,659
I'm doing this stuff, and there's the exercise that keeps me...

35
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,580
Exercise is the big thing for me, plus performing with our live tour,

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,759
but I noticed even those things weren't starting to really have the effect I wanted them to,

37
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,479
like they weren't, you know, whenever I exercise I just feel so happy,

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,620
or performing so happy, or journaling and gratitude, empathy and mindfulness stuff,

39
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,580
and I've noticed in the last few months it hasn't quite been...

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,759
it just hasn't been working the way it usually does,

41
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,620
and that's made me panic a bit and go, oh my God,

42
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,280
if these things aren't working, where am I at now?

43
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,439
But she said, you've just got to drag yourself towards these things right now,

44
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,860
and the wheel will turn for you, but you've got to keep dragging yourself towards this stuff,

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,120
so I don't think I've really answered the question,

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,000
but I know that no matter where you are, we're all on the mental health spectrum somewhere.

47
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,900
Some people are sitting at the top, and life's great, and some are down the bottom,

48
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,479
but if you come back to this stuff, the research says if you practice gratitude,

49
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,439
which is where you pay attention to what you've got,

50
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,599
you don't worry about what you don't have,

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,439
you can practice empathy, which is when you put yourself...

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,800
in someone else's shoes, and you look for compassionate action from that,

53
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:17,360
and if you practice mindfulness, just being wherever you are,

54
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,099
the only thing that is really happening in our world is what's happening right now.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,139
Those things will have a positive impact on your mental health.

56
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:27,340
Those things will help you to experience more joy,

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,259
and even... I used to say this from a place of privilege,

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,599
which I was just so happy, no problems in my life.

59
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,060
Life was great. Come on, guys, do this stuff. It really helps.

60
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,960
I'm now saying it from a place of life's pretty tough at the moment,

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,599
and I know this stuff is going to get better.

62
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,080
It's going to get me through, even if it doesn't feel like it is at the time,

63
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,300
I could have kept dragging myself to the treadmill,

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,780
dragging myself to the gym, dragging myself to my journal,

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,520
dragging myself to breathwork, whatever it is, and the wheel will turn.

66
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,680
And do you feel that consistency is the key?

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,680
And like a lot of people, when it gets stressful,

68
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,639
it's almost the hardest time.

69
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,900
You say drag yourself to the treadmill.

70
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,340
Absolutely.

71
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,159
Hard to write in your journal when you're feeling shit.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Hard to be mindful when there's chaos going on on whatever front there is.

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
And do you think sometimes we kid ourselves a little bit when we go,

74
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,259
it's not working, but if we actually write down,

75
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,500
we go, I may have let that slip a little bit more than I understood.

76
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,120
Does that make sense?

77
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,180
Yeah, and it's so hard when you're not feeling good.

78
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,139
It's so much harder than when you're feeling good.

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,060
You have a good day and think, gosh, shit,

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,220
things are going pretty well for me at the moment.

81
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,579
I might write a gratitude journal.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,579
That's not hard.

83
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,180
It's good for you.

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,860
It's good to do it.

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,519
But when you are really up against it and you've got some stuff really going wrong

86
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,100
in your life, stuff that you may not be able to control,

87
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,819
which makes it even more challenging at times,

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,819
that's when it's hard to, you know, fuck doing a gratitude journal.

89
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,920
I'll have a beer.

90
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,579
You know?

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
That's like who's in control of you?

92
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,160
Like who's controlling you?

93
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,220
Like who is in control?

94
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,439
But it's like just if you're looking at a couple of options,

95
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
which is staying up later, having a beer,

96
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,660
or journaling and going to bed early,

97
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,060
or doing the stuff that makes you feel good,

98
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,220
if you're taking the option that you know in that moment,

99
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,839
like I know this isn't the right thing to do,

100
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,779
but I'm going to do it anyway.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,399
You just ask yourself the question,

102
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,819
who's got the control panel here?

103
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,899
Like I want to control myself right now.

104
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,120
I think often I think I do so many analogies around running,

105
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,420
but as a runner, you'll have those days where you get up and you're like,

106
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm not feeling it today, but you do it anyway.

107
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,800
And it doesn't, it's not as quick as you usually go,

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,199
but you've got the miles in your legs and you go, well, I've done that.

109
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,279
It wasn't my best, but I dragged myself there.

110
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,279
I've sort of got that approach to everything right now.

111
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,819
This idea that success leaves clues is a term I use every week on this podcast.

112
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,139
And we've seen these traits of different leaders,

113
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,199
and I'm fascinated with you because you're such a deep thinker and so articulate.

114
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,319
The idea that it's hard to lead anyone else without a sense of self-leadership

115
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,920
is something we talk about a lot.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,420
What does that mean to you, self-leadership?

117
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,639
Oh, self-leadership.

118
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,399
I have thought about this because I hear the term come up,

119
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,060
a bit throughout a leader.

120
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,699
Self-leadership, I think self-leadership is giving yourself,

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,199
it's like protecting your energy and giving yourself space to think about

122
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,420
what is best for you, understanding that that will also be best

123
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,379
for the people who are around you.

124
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,740
And I think the tendency for a lot of us is to see a spare hour

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,480
in our calendar and fill it, or see a spare afternoon in the calendar

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,560
and just fill it and go, oh, I could do this then, I could do this then.

127
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,699
We go from one thing to the next.

128
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,100
And the more, in the last few years that I have protected those,

129
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
like just have nothing to do, I think more creatively.

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,779
I think about, I end up thinking about the people around me.

131
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,480
Like I think about our podcast team, I think about the Resilience Project team.

132
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,639
And I think about what's, what I need to do for myself to be in a good place.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
And I prioritize that stuff.

134
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,160
I think that makes me a better leader.

135
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,699
The more time, ironically, the more time I have off, the better leader I am, I think.

136
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,920
It's a brilliant answer.

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,959
And I haven't heard anyone go there before, isn't it?

138
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,279
Around, yeah, allocating that free time.

139
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,279
And my mind was going to that analogy of the, give yourself the oxygen mask first

140
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,480
on the plane because you can't save the infant next to you.

141
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,120
Is that, is that?

142
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
I think so.

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,220
I remember, I can't remember, like protect your energy has been a big thing

144
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,600
for me in the last year or two.

145
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,939
Cause I've burnt out, I think 2019, 2020, I burnt out three years in a row.

146
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,540
I got to November and I was really unwell.

147
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,139
And I wouldn't say it was like a,

148
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,480
I wore it as a badge of honor, but I was like, well, I've given everything this year.

149
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,420
I've gone so hard.

150
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,959
But then when you go so hard like that, you're not the only one who suffers.

151
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,839
Like the people that you love most in your life suffer,

152
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,360
the people who are closest to you suffer.

153
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,439
So my partner, my kids and the teams that I, I love my podcast team.

154
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,220
And I love my resilience project team.

155
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,959
They suffer too.

156
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,439
And I think we forget that sometimes.

157
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,540
And so I managed to work out a way of like, I'm protecting,

158
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,660
but my overall thing is protect your energy.

159
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,800
And to do that, protect this time.

160
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,779
So I've got in my calendar and I've got,

161
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,480
there are four people who have access to my calendar and can schedule stuff for me.

162
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,139
And I've just got Hugh not available.

163
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,720
And there's big chunks that go for the next two years.

164
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,139
I've already got them just out there and I'm not,

165
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,019
they're not allowed to touch them.

166
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,980
I know they can't touch them.

167
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,100
And it's not, I'm being lazy.

168
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,600
It's like, I am, Billy Slater said the 2022 series,

169
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,019
Save Origin series.

170
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,839
He said to the players really early on camp, he said,

171
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,540
you only have one energy pool.

172
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,959
I said, you've got one energy and we've got a game in 10 days time.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,860
And I want you to remember that the time you spend on social media,

174
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,000
worrying about what fans think,

175
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,680
the times you spend reading what the paper says,

176
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,240
the time you spend in this 10 day camp,

177
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,319
I want this to be about protecting as much energy as possible.

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,560
He didn't say protecting energy.

179
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,379
He said, I want it to be about understanding you have one energy.

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,459
It's not like you can go, well,

181
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,139
I'll just lie on the couch and give those energy to social media and have

182
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,600
energy left for the game tomorrow night.

183
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,360
So you've got one energy and I want you to be very focused on keeping it as

184
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,059
full as possible.

185
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,120
And that really spoke,

186
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,580
to me not about state of origin.

187
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,120
That was not for me.

188
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
It was just, yeah,

189
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,639
I only have,

190
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,120
I only have one energy.

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,179
And I think to myself,

192
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,159
I can do all these talks and I can run during the day and then I can come

193
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,240
home and have energy for the family,

194
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,799
but you only have this one energy.

195
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,519
So my running is,

196
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,779
is the analogy of running is like I'm a sprinter and with sprinters,

197
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,480
it's like it's preparation for races is trying to have as much energy as

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,759
possible.

199
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,340
So you don't smash yourself in the wake,

200
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,779
letting up to the training.

201
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,059
You,

202
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
you're really clever about it and you taper.

203
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,899
And it's almost like,

204
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,039
I'm sort of tapering for life now.

205
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm like,

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,940
if I want to have energy at the end of the day for the kids,

207
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,179
which is the hardest part of the day,

208
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,940
I can't do four talks.

209
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,600
I can't run.

210
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,259
I need to have time where that,

211
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,240
that to me is like,

212
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,700
I know it,

213
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,460
it doesn't sound like self-leadership,

214
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,399
but my version of that is it's like,

215
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,879
look after yourself,

216
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,860
leave a lot of petrol in the tank for the people around you.

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,940
I think basics are just really important for me,

218
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:32,919
like self-leadership,

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,220
like,

220
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:33,580
um,

221
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:35,720
eat well,

222
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:36,840
exercise,

223
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:37,940
uh,

224
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,120
every day and try and get enough sleep.

225
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,019
And,

226
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:41,659
uh,

227
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,100
that's it.

228
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,700
And do those things consistently,

229
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,639
um,

230
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,580
do the basics consistently.

231
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,919
For me,

232
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,580
it makes me feel really,

233
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,139
um,

234
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,000
up to it,

235
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,500
up for the task and,

236
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:56,460
and to be clear headed,

237
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:56,940
I guess,

238
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,179
because,

239
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,519
you know,

240
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,419
every day you're absorbing,

241
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,360
you're absorbing people's anxieties,

242
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:03,879
their,

243
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,419
their difficulties,

244
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,299
um,

245
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,500
and,

246
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,059
and to not spend my free time absorbing too much,

247
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,159
like social media,

248
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:15,399
TV,

249
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:16,500
you know,

250
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,059
um,

251
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,200
of course I do,

252
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,519
you know,

253
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:18,720
like,

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
of course I'll watch something or whatever,

255
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,539
but not too,

256
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:22,340
not too much.

257
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,179
I'm conscious of like,

258
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't need to pick up my phone and check Instagram every two hours.

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,480
Like I'll re I'll read the news at the start of the day and the end of the day.

260
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,740
I'll make a conscious effort.

261
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,580
I don't need to know.

262
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't need to know what a local council bus does going on.

263
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,399
I don't,

264
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,279
I don't need to know it.

265
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,440
It's too much information.

266
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,240
So that's it for me,

267
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,919
like pretty straightforward,

268
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,500
which is sounds easy,

269
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,240
but in the rock and roll industry that that must have taken some courage to be

270
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,740
able to,

271
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,279
and the peer pressure must have been enormous.

272
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,759
As you said,

273
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,600
it's an industry where it's the rock and roll lifestyle,

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:55,960
isn't it?

275
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,379
So to be someone that's like,

276
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,519
I don't need to do that,

277
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,279
um,

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,440
takes incredible leadership.

279
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,679
It's a,

280
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,620
it's a great story.

281
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,539
We're really passionate about the impact people are conscious of having on others.

282
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,740
And I want to ask you the question,

283
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:06,840
is,

284
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,379
is there one piece of leadership advice that you've taken on board that you

285
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,159
share regularly?

286
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,320
Is there something that comes to mind on that front?

287
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,299
I think it is.

288
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,940
I don't know if anyone gave me the advice or it just came over time.

289
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,539
Like,

290
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,870
well,

291
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,789
maybe again,

292
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:26,710
it's really simple.

293
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:28,370
Luke.

294
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,850
It's like,

295
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:30,049
have fun.

296
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,830
Are you having fun?

297
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,870
Like if you're making music,

298
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,470
is it fun?

299
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:35,429
Are you having fun?

300
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,950
And always ask yourself,

301
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,610
why,

302
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,710
why am I doing this?

303
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,889
Like the whole thing when we all get caught in the minutia of what we do every day and

304
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,149
we get frustrated and,

305
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:47,269
um,

306
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,070
nah,

307
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:49,009
I mean,

308
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:49,769
of course we're going to get for it.

309
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:50,470
So I'm not saying,

310
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,809
you know,

311
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,690
I'm a Buddhist monk,

312
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:52,950
you know,

313
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,330
things annoy me and,

314
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:54,929
and stuff,

315
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:55,769
but,

316
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,330
but to just strip it back,

317
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,269
just keep it really simple.

318
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:01,629
We don't need to overcomplicate what we're doing.

319
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:02,009
You know,

320
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,570
like if I'm operating to remove a tumor from someone's brain,

321
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,909
I suspect that is pretty complicated.

322
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:14,309
But if we're trying to put some music up on a streaming service and sell some tickets,

323
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,009
is it fun?

324
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,250
And why,

325
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,090
why are we doing it?

326
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,289
And that's,

327
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,350
that that's it.

328
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,190
It means so much to me because it's a reflection of when we look at a seed,

329
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,009
if you look at a seed,

330
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:29,669
it's like this,

331
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,549
just this tiny little something.

332
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,929
And then what people come to see is when they're eating the fruits of it.

333
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,649
And when you're like,

334
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:37,830
you know,

335
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,289
you have a tree or a bush and it's like,

336
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:39,789
Oh my God,

337
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:40,509
this is amazing.

338
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,009
But you're like,

339
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,129
actually it started as a seed.

340
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,950
And what,

341
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,090
what is the seed that defines us?

342
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,850
And not being overwhelmed by thinking of,

343
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,049
okay,

344
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,190
we have to become this huge mango tree or this huge bush,

345
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,269
but just being focused on nurturing that small seed.

346
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,470
And then so many things come together,

347
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:58,470
the weather,

348
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,990
it's the weather coming together.

349
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,669
It's the soil.

350
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:03,710
So that's how we are as humans and in the work that we do.

351
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,389
And for me,

352
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,529
that's what really helps me not get too overwhelmed,

353
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,289
overwhelmed about what we're doing.

354
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:09,970
It's like,

355
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,370
do your part and then the rest will take care of itself.

356
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,289
And that's what happened with Safari doctors.

357
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:16,289
That's what's happening.

358
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,169
That's what happens with raising kids.

359
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,970
You don't get a manual told,

360
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,250
okay,

361
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,190
this is how your adult would look like.

362
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,730
Therefore do this today,

363
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,350
this tomorrow.

364
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,129
So that's the philosophy around that consistency.

365
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:29,169
It's because of,

366
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:30,669
you have to pace yourself,

367
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,990
knowing that what you're a part of is much bigger than yourself.

368
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,049
So just do your part.

369
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,429
And you mentioned raising kids and you're a mother.

370
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,269
And do you take that same approach to you that you're really just in,

371
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,250
in every day you can do small things.

372
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,570
And hopefully at the end that you've made the contribution you want to your

373
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,009
own family.

374
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:48,330
It's because,

375
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,809
you know,

376
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,250
you trust in that DNA,

377
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,909
what makes you up and you do what you can because,

378
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,570
or else it's kind of,

379
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:54,850
you know,

380
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,429
like moving countries.

381
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:56,889
Someone's like,

382
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,149
you know,

383
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,990
so what's your plan?

384
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,409
What are you,

385
00:13:58,649 --> 00:13:58,850
you know,

386
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,490
in five years,

387
00:13:59,529 --> 00:13:59,850
three years.

388
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,769
I know there's something bigger that this is a journey off.

389
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,070
And sometimes you can define what your,

390
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:07,450
where,

391
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:07,870
you're headed.

392
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,789
Sometimes you just open trusting that the steps that you're taking in your

393
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,710
leadership journey,

394
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,009
in your parenthood journey,

395
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,330
in your workspaces,

396
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,889
that it being open to what's unfolding and trusting that you're,

397
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,269
you're wired to go through that on my end,

398
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,610
more severely though,

399
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:27,370
I is like,

400
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,230
I have a serious allergy to injustice,

401
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,950
like super allergic to that.

402
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,490
I'm talking,

403
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:37,009
I will not be quiet.

404
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,970
And I think for me,

405
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,509
that's what pushes me to kind of,

406
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,950
maybe it's almost like proving a point that,

407
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,250
you know,

408
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:45,629
you say whether it's like,

409
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:45,809
Oh,

410
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,350
as women,

411
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,269
you can't or shouldn't be able to do this.

412
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,710
I'm like that invoke some serious self-leadership to prove otherwise.

413
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,529
You're talking about,

414
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:54,750
Oh,

415
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,169
you know,

416
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,850
talk about race.

417
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,269
You talk about nationalism,

418
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,769
you bring it.

419
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,330
But for me,

420
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,889
it's like really puts up that fire.

421
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,750
And especially in like seeing it for the next generation,

422
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,690
because I feel like we're,

423
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,309
we're almost in that phase of,

424
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
it's no longer about aspiring,

425
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:17,350
but about transmitting before then checking out and being like,

426
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,590
okay,

427
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,529
you've done what you've done.

428
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,090
So also the young,

429
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,590
the next generation is really inspiring.

430
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:28,529
It drives me to have that push of,

431
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:28,850
okay,

432
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,590
we need to pass that baton on.

433
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:33,909
You need to be on top of your stuff.

434
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,330
You need to be that role model.

435
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:36,590
You need to explore,

436
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,830
find the boundaries.

437
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,929
Yes.

438
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,309
You have to understand yourself,

439
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,649
but you also have to understand them.

440
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:47,230
That's why it's important to ask questions because when you ask questions of

441
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,730
people,

442
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,909
you begin to understand them as well as the issues.

443
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:51,750
Um,

444
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,690
but I think leaders need to be comfortable in their own skin in many ways.

445
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:04,289
And for someone like me that came from sport as well as the classroom,

446
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,190
you know,

447
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,429
I think I learned more,

448
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,049
about leadership on the sporting field than I did in the classroom probably.

449
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,070
And I think I'm not unusual in that sense.

450
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,129
So,

451
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,809
um,

452
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,309
the other thing you have to,

453
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,029
if you're going to lead in a business sense or in a sporting sense,

454
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,289
you better really understand the industry or the game you're involved in.

455
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,330
I think the best leaders are passionate about the,

456
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,169
the business they're in or the sport they're in or the business of sport.

457
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,730
They're passionate about,

458
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,649
they think about it in the shower in the morning.

459
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,590
They don't sort of pick it up at nine o'clock and put it down at five.

460
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:47,230
And they're constantly curious about understanding the new things that are coming in.

461
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,730
So,

462
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,629
you know,

463
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,129
aviation when I retired was very different to aviation when I joined.

464
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,750
Technology had changed,

465
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,850
aeroplanes had changed,

466
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,850
but the way in which we use it systems had changed remarkably.

467
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,690
No,

468
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,109
we'd gone from people booking a flight on the telephone to doing it online.

469
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,369
I mean,

470
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:06,710
there were,

471
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,970
it was constantly changing and you've got to stay abreast of those changes.

472
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:19,029
We are really privileged to have many of the guests that you hear from the empowering leaders podcast who are part of our leader connect program.

473
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:27,430
We bring together groups of five to six people from around the globe from unique and diverse backgrounds who come together to learn and to connect and to share.

474
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:34,349
We are really passionate about what happens when you connect great people together in a really trusted environment.

475
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:36,289
We'd love to tell you more about it.

476
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,410
Head to elitacollective.com and book a discovery call with us today.

477
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,190
We are super proud to be working alongside one of the world's great learning institutions,

478
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,670
Victoria University as our support partner in 2025.

479
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,569
No one sees you like VU.

480
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:54,230
Victoria University is uniquely you.

481
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,230
We see a lot of great synergy between the world of Victoria University and our passion for the world of a leader and the empowering leaders podcast.

482
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:04,150
This episode is also proudly brought to you by temper mattresses,

483
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,730
adjustable bases and pillows.

484
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,269
The difference is temper.

485
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,829
The next group of guests all speak of how self leadership has driven them to the highest levels of success.

486
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,410
We're going to hear from Reggie Butler,

487
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,849
the founder and CEO of performance paradigm,

488
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,190
one of the world's most respected leaders in connecting teams and developing great people.

489
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,829
Kirsten King joins us,

490
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,529
the founder of fluid form Pilates,

491
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,230
a brilliant success story in her own right.

492
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,490
But let's first go to James Tonkin.

493
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,369
Oh, I am a sport Australia hall of fame legend and perhaps best known.

494
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:35,430
Okay.

495
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:44,750
As one quarter of the awesome foursome that won world titles in 1990 91 98 and Olympic gold in 92 and 96.

496
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:50,190
The Olympic village is the example to the rest of the world of what is possible.

497
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,809
You've got every race,

498
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,089
color,

499
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,549
creed,

500
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,230
religion in there.

501
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,250
And because of something,

502
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,289
and in this case,

503
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,670
it's sport just bringing everyone together and it doesn't matter.

504
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,170
Christian,

505
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,670
Muslim,

506
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,029
black,

507
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,450
white,

508
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:03,690
you know,

509
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,349
whatever you cry,

510
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,369
or maybe the Ukraine,

511
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:07,849
Russian things might be a bit of tension,

512
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,349
but,

513
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,630
uh,

514
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,210
you know,

515
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,089
because of something,

516
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,049
it brings that whole world together and it's,

517
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,210
it's a fantastic example.

518
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,869
And I do think that there is a lot to learn from the history of the games.

519
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,470
Um,

520
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,369
if you ever get the chance,

521
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:25,690
Luke,

522
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,630
the Olympic charter is fantastic.

523
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:34,630
And there's a notion of Olympism and it's the joy of sport that everyone loves.

524
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,730
Um,

525
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,809
that everyone should be able to participate in,

526
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:44,430
but it's also striving and leading a balanced life of mind,

527
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,730
body,

528
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,349
and soul.

529
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,509
So academics for the mind,

530
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,630
athletics for the body and arts for the soul.

531
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,529
And this all came out from the games in antiquity,

532
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:54,829
you know,

533
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,210
what is it?

534
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,109
Two and a half thousand years ago,

535
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:02,390
seven 76 BC was the first games and long winded answer.

536
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,930
But.

537
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,750
Back then when you died,

538
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:12,230
the only way you would ascend to the gods was if you'd led a balanced life,

539
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,789
a little bit of those three components.

540
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,750
And you look at the way we live now,

541
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:23,269
and we're so fixated on one aspect and it might be sport like I'm a footy player.

542
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,630
I'm a row and that's all I do.

543
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,289
And I don't do,

544
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:25,490
you know,

545
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,589
I don't have any context or anything else in my life.

546
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:32,750
And so I think there's a lot to learn in all of us trying to lead a balanced life.

547
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:32,910
Um,

548
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,890
and it's not a third,

549
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,170
a third,

550
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:34,549
a third,

551
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,450
and it'll float around.

552
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,390
But I think it's really important to have other things in your life.

553
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,190
If you're working,

554
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:46,549
learn a language or an instrument or do an event where you actually need to train for it.

555
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,910
Not like a two K fun run,

556
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,549
but something where you've actually got to put some time into it.

557
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,130
And I think having other things in your life and having,

558
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,329
having that balance is really,

559
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,130
really important.

560
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,490
So,

561
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,849
and that was a couple of thousand years ago.

562
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,609
The Greek philosophers were onto this job.

563
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,769
You retired on your 45th birthday.

564
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,809
And in a grueling sport like that,

565
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,930
you can see why I'm watching teenage girls burn out because of training at 16 or 17.

566
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,329
But you had that perfect build up and Olympic cycle was four years and you just seem,

567
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,690
you know,

568
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,650
the Olympic ethos,

569
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,029
wasn't it?

570
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,089
You take your time off.

571
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:19,529
You take,

572
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:19,730
yeah,

573
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,430
we take a year off after every Olympics,

574
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,150
full year off,

575
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,809
full year,

576
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,309
sometimes jump in a boat,

577
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,930
not jump in a boat,

578
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,950
go and do,

579
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,190
you know,

580
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,089
we're staying active.

581
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,049
We're doing to play footy,

582
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:29,650
um,

583
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,849
ride your bike,

584
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:31,109
bike,

585
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:31,890
go surfing,

586
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,170
you know,

587
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,750
running,

588
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,250
stuff.

589
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:34,210
But then,

590
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,650
but then you're fresh,

591
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:37,130
fresh to go again.

592
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,829
You're keen to get back on the border and,

593
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:39,190
and,

594
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,490
um,

595
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,869
and reengage with it again.

596
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,109
And,

597
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:41,410
you know,

598
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:47,269
we talked to the swimmers and they were so scared of missing a session because they thought we'd lose the feel of the water.

599
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:47,849
It's like,

600
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,210
you're bloody world's best swimmer.

601
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,549
You're not going to lose that skill overnight.

602
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,410
Just take a break.

603
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,009
And,

604
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:54,250
uh,

605
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:55,009
but I think that,

606
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:01,329
and that's being brave to back yourself and,

607
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:01,750
um,

608
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:02,210
again,

609
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,710
balance.

610
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:03,369
You know,

611
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,589
if I wouldn't have gone six Olympiads,

612
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,329
if I'd gone all the way through it,

613
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:07,809
no way.

614
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:08,470
Yeah.

615
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,450
So taking those breaks along the way and resetting and refreshing,

616
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,890
ready to go again.

617
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,130
Yeah.

618
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm a pretty positive person.

619
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:18,130
I think,

620
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,490
uh,

621
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,690
you know,

622
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,089
rowing is the ultimate team sport.

623
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:22,750
I mean,

624
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,109
in footy or netball,

625
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,670
you can have people out on the wings that aren't having a great game and the team can still win.

626
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:27,789
And,

627
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:28,329
but that,

628
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:30,730
that can't happen in the boat.

629
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,829
Um,

630
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:33,869
and we got to the point,

631
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:34,470
I guess,

632
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:34,829
you know,

633
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:35,190
however,

634
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,430
it's such a long career.

635
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:36,809
You,

636
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:41,009
we were probably doing things or I was probably doing things that didn't realize what we were,

637
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,950
what it was,

638
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,130
but then toward the back end of your career,

639
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,710
you realize,

640
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,829
oh,

641
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:44,970
wow,

642
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,109
that's actually really good behaviors and you're luckily doing the right thing.

643
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:52,589
And I think I can describe it,

644
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,069
uh,

645
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,569
by saying that,

646
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:56,849
you know,

647
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,369
when we finished up my,

648
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,710
so drew rowing with drew,

649
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:02,849
in Athens,

650
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,309
my goal in,

651
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:11,849
in rowing with him was to row in such a way that allowed him to perform at his best.

652
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,970
So zero self-interest,

653
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:23,049
like I could sit in the boat and row as hard as I possibly could and tear the side of the boat off and make it so uncomfortable for him that he couldn't perform his best.

654
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:23,630
But if I go,

655
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,690
how can I run such a way that allows him to absolutely nail it?

656
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,069
And if he reciprocates,

657
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:29,849
yeah,

658
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,150
I mean,

659
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,809
that is the ultimate team.

660
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,470
And that is the ultimate in selflessness.

661
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,930
I think that's the ultimate in leadership.

662
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,150
Take the ego away,

663
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,650
take the self-interest away of your next promotion.

664
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,750
What can I do to help my team absolutely thrive?

665
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,029
Yeah.

666
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,650
And if they thrive,

667
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,269
yeah,

668
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:48,970
again,

669
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,869
the byproduct is I'll probably get that promotion instead of worrying about the promotion.

670
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,490
You'd go and get your team absolutely up and thriving.

671
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,170
What I'm saying to make a stronger human connection,

672
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,809
you should,

673
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:07,410
you want to know what a person's priorities are so you can be supportive of the priority.

674
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,269
You're still going to get other things done,

675
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,470
but we're not.

676
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,509
We're transactional at best.

677
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,210
I believe this and I don't want any listeners to hear this out of context,

678
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,210
but we,

679
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:23,829
most of us are selfish first.

680
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,430
Like when we wake up,

681
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,609
we have a list of things to do,

682
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,269
whether written down or in our head of things.

683
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,509
We need to do to make our day better of things.

684
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:37,170
We need to do to get things done through other people.

685
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:41,509
And we start with us and then somewhere in the middle of the day,

686
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:44,089
if something dramatic or traumatic happens,

687
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:47,529
we'll pay attention to somebody else's thing that they need.

688
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,049
But most of us are selfish first.

689
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:55,049
When I am talking about what I need leaders and companies to start to figure out how to do

690
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,450
is how can you wake up and be centered on what other people need as a part of your day to day life?

691
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:00,670
Yeah.

692
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:00,769
Yeah.

693
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,150
Part of your daily routine still do what you need to do for you.

694
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:06,910
But in parallel,

695
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,509
can you think about who am I going to help today or this week or next week?

696
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,309
How can I be supportive of somebody today or this week or next week?

697
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,390
I didn't say don't pay attention to your own list and your own priorities,

698
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,930
but we need to start to add other humans to our,

699
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,849
our planning phase of our days,

700
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:27,390
our weeks,

701
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,009
our months.

702
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,309
And you'll see a very slight shift,

703
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:38,089
toward people are caring about one another in a different way now because you did it on purpose.

704
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,130
It was intentional.

705
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,630
You woke up.

706
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,990
I got a leader who said this to me,

707
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,170
says,

708
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,490
Reggie,

709
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,049
you know what I wake up and I do on Mondays.

710
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,509
Now I ask people on my team,

711
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,250
what do you need from me this week?

712
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,930
I don't ask them about their weekend,

713
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,690
their weekends for them.

714
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,849
Why would I encroach on that narrative?

715
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,750
I asked them,

716
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,470
Hey,

717
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,210
let's get started.

718
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,509
What do you need from me this week?

719
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,650
And people get to take it.

720
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,029
They tell me what they need.

721
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,650
Will they still talk about their weekends?

722
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,130
Maybe,

723
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,789
maybe not.

724
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,869
I don't need to use that as the entryway to get to know somebody.

725
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:09,170
So I said,

726
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,130
what do you need from me this week?

727
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:11,049
You know what happened,

728
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:11,450
Reggie?

729
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:12,890
People started telling me,

730
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,490
Hey,

731
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,569
uh,

732
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:17,569
I've got a doctor's appointment with my son on Thursday.

733
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,950
There's a really big meeting.

734
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,150
I was supposed to be a part of,

735
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:23,529
I'd like to see if there's a way I can have somebody take my place.

736
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,829
They would have never asked that question.

737
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,210
If the leader hadn't led with,

738
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:30,630
how can I help you this week?

739
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,029
Think about that.

740
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:32,750
He said,

741
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,069
somebody else on my team went,

742
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,910
uh,

743
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,789
sons or daughters,

744
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,509
um,

745
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,509
got a special celebration happening at their school.

746
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,670
I have never been to one of them.

747
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,569
I would love to go.

748
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,809
It happens to be tomorrow.

749
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,890
And I didn't put in time off.

750
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,150
I didn't tell anybody,

751
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,609
but you were asking me how I can be helpful.

752
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:53,329
That would be helpful.

753
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,089
Now those,

754
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,210
both of those sent sent seemed personal.

755
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,029
Remember work,

756
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,329
family,

757
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:57,509
health,

758
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:57,950
spirituality,

759
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,430
community.

760
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,089
Those were both family related.

761
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,130
Somebody else in this person's team said,

762
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,849
you know what?

763
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:07,349
I need you to extend a deadline because I'm not going to make it by

764
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,269
Wednesday and I'm telling,

765
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,009
I'd rather tell you,

766
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,809
ask me what can be helpful is can you move some things out of my

767
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,809
way and help me prioritize so I can either meet the deadline

768
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:19,829
or can you extend the deadline again?

769
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,730
That person's prioritization was work,

770
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,369
but that leader would have gotten none of those answers had he not

771
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,809
repositioned his framing for interacting with his team.

772
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,430
For something as simple as Monday morning catch up.

773
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,910
I think first and foremost,

774
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,349
it is about turning up for you.

775
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:39,710
You know,

776
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,349
you are in my role as a leader.

777
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,490
I'm very compassionate,

778
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:45,569
caring,

779
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,549
supportive.

780
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,589
Um,

781
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,950
so in order for me to fill everyone else's cup,

782
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,289
my cup needs to be filled up and don't get me wrong.

783
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,769
I'm not always great at it,

784
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,769
but you become aware really quickly.

785
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:01,750
When you're starting to be depleted,

786
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,869
whether that's in your workplace or at home,

787
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:05,410
you know,

788
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:05,950
I'm not,

789
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,930
I'm not only a leader at fluid form.

790
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,250
I'm also a leader at home.

791
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,369
I've got three young girls and I want to be the best

792
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,349
possible role model I can to them.

793
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,130
So I thought I have two leadership hats and that can be,

794
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:18,670
you know,

795
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,289
draining and fatiguing as well.

796
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:21,190
Um,

797
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,230
so for me,

798
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,529
you know,

799
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,130
making sure that movement is part of every day for me,

800
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,990
whether it's 15 minutes,

801
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,230
you know,

802
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,089
at home,

803
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,410
whether it's a class in one of the studios,

804
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:37,390
I'm making sure I'm having time just to think,

805
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:37,990
you know,

806
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,829
to think about,

807
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:39,609
to dream,

808
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:39,990
you know,

809
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,349
about that big picture stuff,

810
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:45,609
because that really motivates you when you're dealing with the day to

811
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:46,450
day.

812
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,150
Uh,

813
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,109
I think making sure that your dream is constantly there and you're

814
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,029
thinking about it is so important and not being so hard on

815
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:54,869
yourself.

816
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,869
I think we are just as human beings,

817
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,170
just so hard on ourselves.

818
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,549
These days from,

819
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,789
you know,

820
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,150
the access of social media and everything that is thrown at us and what we

821
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:11,430
see and the pressures we just need to be more compassionate to our own

822
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,130
self.

823
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,670
And if we need that time out to have it,

824
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:15,569
you know,

825
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:17,930
you need our eldest daughter,

826
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,569
Charlie,

827
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,390
she graduated from primary school.

828
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:20,730
Um,

829
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,650
it was like a fanfare.

830
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,390
There was so many activities on and,

831
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:25,869
you know,

832
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,809
I was trying to juggle work the entire week and it was just,

833
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,430
at one point I was like,

834
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,630
okay,

835
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,869
I can't go to work on Wednesday.

836
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,269
I've got too much on.

837
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,210
And,

838
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,490
you know,

839
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,089
I I'm always really honest with my team guys.

840
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,369
This is what's on with Charlie.

841
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,730
Can't make it in.

842
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:40,990
Call me if you need me,

843
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,250
but I'll see you on Thursday.

844
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,789
And just knowing that I had that time for her and didn't

845
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,809
have to worry about anything on that day,

846
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,210
it just allowed everything else to continue to flow.

847
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,650
Cause it's all about flow,

848
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,190
you know,

849
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,730
find your state of flow and stay in it.

850
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,390
When you can.

851
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,809
And how brilliant is that for your team that you've just shown them

852
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,609
that family comes first by taking that action.

853
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,690
And as the leader,

854
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,329
no matter how busy work was,

855
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:11,150
I'm having that day because that is the most important thing in

856
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,529
my life.

857
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:13,170
And that allows them to be able to ring you one

858
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:13,890
day and say,

859
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:14,529
Hey,

860
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:14,970
Kirsten,

861
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,150
I really need this day and know that they're going to

862
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,990
be supported.

863
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,789
And that's,

864
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,190
you know,

865
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,710
how great culture starts and continues.

866
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,089
Huge.

867
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:25,230
Thanks to all the guests featured in this episode,

868
