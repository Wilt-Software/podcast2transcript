1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,250
As soon as I start talking, I'm like, be Max Gorn.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,910
And then it just, it flows.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,089
So important for me to use this opportunity to communicate, to translate.

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,289
I think it is really about having sort of clear, concise messaging.

5
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,510
I want you to hit these three target points.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,949
We're all sticking to these three talking points.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,070
Well, I've been lucky enough to record so many engaging conversations with remarkable leaders,

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,010
or what I think are engaging conversations, in the past year.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,390
And covering the keys to their success.

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:38,030
2024, our audience have had a front row seat to conversations that reveal

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,630
how success leaves clues, featuring guests from across the globe

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,170
who are at the top of their game.

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,890
At Alida, we understand the consistent dimensions of brilliant leadership,

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,270
and we love exploring them in this special series.

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,789
The art of communicating with clarity is an individual skill

16
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,890
and one worth honing with practice and good advice.

17
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,969
Every week on the Empowering Leaders series,

18
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:00,890
our conversations stretch.

19
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,829
Across different fields, people from the world of sport,

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,489
business leaders, champions of education, social venture, and the arts.

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,329
And this episode, we've curated what we think is a remarkable group of individuals

22
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:17,170
who take communicating with clarity seriously and explain exactly how they do it.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,090
You'll hear from Paul Watterson, the founder and chief executive officer of Australian Venue Co.

24
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:27,409
and a serial successful business investor in everything he does.

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,230
Australian football icon Max Gorn joins us.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,109
A seven-time All-Australian,

27
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,290
Premiership Captain of the Melbourne Football Club,

28
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,849
and regarded as one of the game's greatest ever ruckman.

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,069
But let's get started with Dr. Troy Flanagan,

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,250
Vice President of High Performance at the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,909
Troy is a sports physiologist with a remarkable background in sports technology development

32
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,450
that includes a PhD in aerospace engineering.

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,230
I think the first thing that comes to my mind is I'm the guy who interprets all the

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,790
technical jargon and gives it to the general manager and the owner.

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,870
And so I take,

36
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:07,109
complex medical jargon about a particular injury and I walk upstairs and say,

37
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,069
okay, here's what's going on with his knees.

38
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,169
Don't, don't, don't.

39
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,009
Actually, the U.S. ski team taught me this.

40
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,569
In any situation, you need three talking points.

41
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:22,270
And as simple as that sounds, like we would have an incident or a new sponsorship or,

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,469
you know, an athlete that's achieved good results or perhaps underachieved,

43
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,150
they always used to meet as a group, collective group and say, okay,

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,949
this has happened.

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,090
These are our talking points.

46
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,710
Everyone on that message.

47
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,509
You can say other things, but I want you to hit these three target points.

48
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,729
If anyone from the media, anyone from the organization,

49
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,229
we're all sticking to these three talking points.

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,030
And I've really taken that forward.

51
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,270
You know, if something's happening here with the Bucks,

52
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,270
I always get the group in and say, okay, this has happened.

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,030
You know, we've got a significant injury.

54
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,330
Here are our talking points, if anyone asks.

55
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,030
Because people will come and ask for information.

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,650
They'll come and ask for information from all different angles.

57
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,409
And, you know, that's certainly in good stead.

58
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,030
And you're talking the highest pressure situations.

59
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,310
You go back to an NBA championship playoff and one of the most high profile athletes

60
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,810
in the world has a knee injury.

61
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,770
Every person in your city wants to know about that knee injury.

62
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,150
And what are you doing, Troy?

63
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,490
How do we get Giannis back on the court?

64
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,270
So again, is it just, here's the three things that we're working on.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,310
Let's stick to that communication.

66
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,110
Does that work under that extreme pressure as well?

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,750
It really does.

68
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,509
And one of the things that I look back on in my time in Australia is the best medical

69
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:40,870
professionals, like Peter Harcourt and all those guys, you know, they're always so calm

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,949
under pressure, like just all sorts of stuff would be happening.

71
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:47,090
And they were just absolutely calm.

72
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,990
Like surgeons, you know, when things are going wrong and they're just so cool and calm.

73
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,409
And that's what I try and if you actually see me in a game, like behind the bench, you

74
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,129
know, the whole crowd is roaring.

75
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,590
And I'm just sitting there.

76
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,590
I'm just sitting there.

77
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,129
And I'm just sitting there calmly, not so much inside, but developed that skill over

78
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:10,490
10 years of, you know, and everything is happening in the gut, wrenching stress of winning an

79
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,550
NBA championship.

80
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,930
You know, it's kind of at the end of COVID, which adds a whole nother lay of stress.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,170
It's taught me to be calm in really chaotic situations.

82
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:26,709
And I think that married with clear communication is has been one of the keys to success.

83
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,430
And even when we've got Dr. Rivers now.

84
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,430
And he's he's a great guy.

85
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,470
Yeah.

86
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,569
He's a great guy.

87
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:35,709
assistant coaches and they're like we can't believe how calm you are in in a injury crisis

88
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:42,149
and you know i've had a lot of them so maybe it just washes off these days but that's something

89
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,990
that has taken years to develop you know i thought i had it after a couple of years but

90
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,370
you know it still get to me the stress would still get to me and and then after about five

91
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,829
years in the nba i'm like it's washing over now i don't i don't feel it anymore and now after 10

92
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,550
years it's i think i've got it got it mastered i love you described that's a skill you went after

93
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,009
and worked on and a mastery of wanting to be that way how important has collaboration been to you

94
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,269
yeah i think it's really the key to success if i talk just nba i think in the past in the nba

95
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:19,389
you know the medical staff and performance staff are over in that corner and coaches are over in

96
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,670
that corner and you know that's coaching and and that's medicine and i i think the really

97
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,310
progressive

98
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,810
you

99
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:32,310
I think world-class teams now are inviting the performance and medical staff into coaches

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,550
meetings there and you know to listen to hear what the coaches are saying directly about the

101
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:43,250
players and taking that information back into that preparation you know i think really the key

102
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,670
to our success or one of the keys to our success has been the inviting nature of the different

103
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,629
groups in the organization and has taught me a lot of how important it is when we've been

104
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,310
successful and when we haven't

105
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,170
it's been awful little and so so we're always striving to you know form those partnerships and

106
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,209
the gm and the coach and i we always say it's a partnership we work in a partnership

107
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:15,490
and and we say that word a lot you know we're partners in this and um that i think that sets

108
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,870
the tone i think it is really about having sort of clear concise messaging and i think being

109
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,189
conscious of all types of communication i think

110
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,790
people sort of typecast talking as communication but it's just as important to be really actively

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,389
listening so that's where i do have to really pull myself in and say just put the phone down

112
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,029
and concentrate on the person in front of you look at their body language look at what they're saying

113
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:48,149
to you look at where the challenges are and try and work through and sort of solve those and i

114
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:54,790
think the other thing is being very clear and decisive on your messaging we've done a there's

115
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,290
a lot of studies out there that show that there's a lot of studies out there that show that there's a lot of

116
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,189
when you meet someone new what you do within that first sort of you know 30 seconds to a minute

117
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,810
is really important about getting your message across so that's the other thing i really try

118
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,389
and focus on when i'm in a meeting or meeting someone new for a half an hour or an hour just

119
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,610
go in and really understand what are the key messages that you want to get across and do it

120
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,089
within the first minute or so because if you can do that and you still got their attention then

121
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,509
hopefully something comes from it

122
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,990
the best version of yourself is the best leader that they can be so not trying to be someone

123
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,990
you're not always reflecting on what you could do better but then also making sure that you're

124
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,089
your best self we do this we do this thing at the club that i've lived and died by now i've i'm i've

125
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:49,310
got a whiteboard at home so jess hates this she wants to be all just on your phone fam cal like

126
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,529
everything goes in the same and calendar but i hate using my phone as i've just said so i've got

127
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,290
this i will all whiteboard as big as this wall

128
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,029
that has like a month up there and i'm a visual person i love seeing it all there

129
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,990
but i set up my week to be the best version i can be so i know on monday

130
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,149
i need to go in the beach at some time have a sauna i need to have uninterrupted time with my

131
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,029
kids i need to read a book and i need to write in my diary and then what i need to do tuesday all

132
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,410
the way to thursday friday you've heard is no phone and that's set up my week and i do that

133
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,430
every sunday night i set my week up and that allows me to be the best version of me and then bang

134
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,290
when i'm the best version of myself and then i'm the best version of myself and then i'm the best version of

135
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,730
me come the time that's let's say it's midday till five i'm at the club on monday i've delegated

136
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,009
that time around it to be the best version i can be at 12 till five as a captain i think the way

137
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,450
people communicate might be the thing that we hear the most that people really have a strategy

138
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,090
on that we've heard about you know your discipline with your phone but if you've got a mantra in the

139
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,129
way that you communicate in the role that you've got uh so the the journal so i've got sort of

140
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,289
everything in terms of the last time i spoke to someone

141
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:01,029
if i'm speaking to them again um so i've got everything written down like you said we're

142
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,370
we're both visual people so it's written down um so i've got that to look at before and look at

143
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,210
after to reflect but i tell myself every time i go into especially hard conversations obviously

144
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,250
hard conversations the easy come the the positive conversations are fine but you walk in and just

145
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,629
before i start i'm like be max corn which is i mean like i said it's harder than you think it is

146
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:26,070
because um it can be quite challenging with the different stresses and anxieties in the world but

147
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,350
as soon as i start talking about be max corn and then it just it flows the harder conversation

148
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,990
isn't necessarily that hard we are really privileged to have many of the guests that

and pillows the difference is temper our final two guests both speak to how communicating with

160
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,370
clarity has helped them to live a life of great success we're going to hear from rachel gunn

161
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,830
better known as ray gunn the australian professor and break dancer who we spoke to just a couple of

162
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,529
days before she flew to paris to compete in the 2024 olympic games where she became a global

163
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:53,889
sensation but first let's go to wayne holdsworth a father and a husband who's bravely shared the

164
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,090
story of his son who died by suicide

165
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:02,289
after experiencing online bullying and extortion a heartbreaking story that touched so many people

166
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:07,529
it's a story that i generally think everyone needs to listen to but we know conversations like this

167
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,649
may be triggering and difficult for many people so please if you are experiencing some challenges

168
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:18,090
call lifeline 13 11 14 if you're affected by this conversation we can make a difference

169
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:25,250
tiktok in a day that's right exactly done that's over yep and and i think with with him for an

170
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,529
it's not about the money it's about the power and that reminds me of a person that

171
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,309
you know terrorized his race way back and we know who adolf hitler was and i really

172
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:42,509
i really worry about that style of person infiltrating australia with the power that

173
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:49,529
he has however we now have an opportunity we know as australians that this exposure

174
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:56,289
is killing our young folk we have no no difficulty in understanding that there's a direct relationship

175
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:03,850
with what they're being fed the algorithms that are underpinning and and then the actions that

176
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,549
particularly young boys and young girls are taking you know through eating disorders through sexual

177
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:17,590
extortion through bullying and so we as australians have to say to the government enough is enough

178
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:25,149
you have to make a call on what our kids are allowed to do you tell them that they have to

179
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,289
wear a seat belt in a car and they have to wear a seat belt in a car and they have to wear a seat belt

180
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:31,769
in a car you tell them that you can't drive until you're 18 you say they can't drink until they're

181
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:41,309
18 although some do why don't you why don't you make a law that says that kids under 16 cannot

182
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:49,129
be exposed to this and if it needs to be 18 so be it because if the government does that and i know

183
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:55,029
whippers doing a really good job in lobbying um the kids be kids are doing the same thing there's a

184
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,289
joint select committee

185
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:01,389
set up in Canberra that I met last week. Some of the people that are involved in that, the

186
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:07,330
chairperson of that, they all agree that this has to happen. Well, bloody do it. Get it

187
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:13,149
done in August and get legislation in November and save our kids because there will be some

188
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,210
kids that are clever enough to get around it and they'll work it out or Zuckerberg will

189
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,210
sort something out. But if we can at least save 50% of those kids and make it easier

190
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,690
on the parents. So the parents aren't the bad guys. It's the law.

191
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:33,309
I was home last night and the conversation still every night, 17 and 13 year olds still

192
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:38,049
there. The phones get locked in another room. You fight to get them off them. I've got active

193
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,929
kids that are healthy and doing a whole range of things, but it's something that I have

194
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,769
people say to me, just take them off it. And they are always people who aren't parents.

195
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:47,070
Correct.

196
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,350
Who don't, this is where their whole connection, it's like asking them to cut an arm or a leg

197
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,649
off is what you're effectively doing.

198
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:52,950
Yeah.

199
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,870
Remove themselves from their whole community. What we need is some guardrails. Now we're

200
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,289
fighting hard on the home fronts. All of us, we're not asleep at the wheel here as parents,

201
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:07,909
but as you said, you know, Seatbelt saved tens of thousands of lives because we needed

202
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:13,549
legislation to do. There is no downside. Whippers campaign to get the 36 months and the age

203
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,029
limit up is an absolute no brainer.

204
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:22,889
We can go further on this, do zero damage and only have the upside. And I think we just,

205
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,590
we can't afford more tragedies like this. They're happening far too often, Wayne. And

206
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,750
for you to, as you said, take the path of education, you know, more strength to your

207
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,230
arm on this.

208
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,450
Yeah. Thanks, mate. Look, you know, the figures, there was 801 people that took their own life

209
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:45,330
in Victoria alone in 2023. There were 299 people die on the road. So it's two and a

210
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,610
half times the number of people died on the road, took their life compared to die on the

211
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,590
road. And 50 people drowned. So incomprehensible.

212
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,809
Comparison. And when I was growing up in the mid seventies, there was a campaign, declare

213
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:06,389
war on 1034 because it was 1034 people died on Victorian roads that year. And now it's

214
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,389
down to 299. As you said, Luke, we're the first country, our first state in the world

215
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:16,210
to introduce compulsory seatbelts, drink driving laws, better roads, better vehicles, better

216
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:22,889
education. So it can be done. We have to do it because our kids,

217
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,669
are becoming, they're so precious and to lose them because of things that we're in

218
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:35,049
control of. It's not as if they've developed a rare form of cancer or they're in a car

219
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:43,470
accident and it's unavoidable. This is avoidable. And we're lame as citizens if we don't force

220
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,730
the government to make a difference and to change it.

221
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,570
They'll look back on our generation and shake their head and say, what the fuck did you

222
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,289
guys do?

223
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,610
And the language is there on purpose because the solutions are there. And I have to mention

224
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,190
this beautiful, extraordinary person, Zoe Kalar, who's created We Are Right. I don't know if

225
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,110
you've come across it. It takes out the anonymity. So immediately 90% of the hate is gone. It's

226
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,450
social media for good. It's putting that 135 billion US from Zuckerberg back into the hands

227
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,090
of community. It's only positivity in there. They could switch off the hate and the algorithms

228
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,909
tomorrow, but they keep you on those apps.

229
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,509
With anger, because they know that's what keeps you and they jam advertising at you

230
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,529
to make more money. We can pull that back. Government, spend your digital advertising

231
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,570
on We Are Right. Let's get the community voice coming through. Let's legislate to up the

232
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,769
age limit, which is a no-brainer. Let's have an education program that you're doing every

233
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,990
single day, teaching families how to deal with this better to save lives. It's an incredible

234
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,929
contribution you're making, Wayne. I know it's heartbreaking to even think about it,

235
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,009
think about what you've been through, but I didn't meet your beautiful young lad, mate.

236
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:01,710
I wish I did, but I feel like he's going to save a lot of people, mate.

237
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:11,029
Yeah, yeah. I'm doing what I do now to create a legacy for him and to use his death as a

238
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:18,730
catalyst to do more in this space. I've been out now to see just over 1,500 people, normally

239
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,849
in the after hours, because I work Monday to Saturday in basketball.

240
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,210
I'm full-time, and my board have been really supportive to allow me to do what I need to

241
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:34,109
do to help the community. When I talk to people about the signs, it's new to them. When I

242
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:39,029
talk to them about the statistics, it's new to them. One in five people here in Australia

243
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:46,309
have suicidal thoughts. We talk about fitness in the footy field. We see someone limping

244
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:52,930
into the change rooms, and Christian Petrarca coming off the ground. That's had so much

245
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,829
exposure, because it was such a horrific injury, because we can see it. But mental fitness,

246
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:05,109
we can't see it. But I want people to ask, not only, how are you going, Christian, you

247
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:10,809
know, physically, but how's your mental fitness going? And if he says, shit, it's at about

248
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:17,849
five or six now, we need to talk to him more. And we need to be talking to people that have

249
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,829
got mental challenges, and to be able to support them through that.

250
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,789
And know what to do. You know, 12 people have come into my office alone. You know, big

251
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:36,630
basketballs. You think that are impervious to this. They've come in crying. You know,

252
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,950
I have to tell them to sit down so I can get level with them. You know, and they're in

253
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,410
a world of pain. But if I can do that, and then I refer them on to someone that can help

254
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:52,430
them, they multiply that by 20 and 40 and 100, and then we're fighting back. And so

255
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,390
my program called Smack Talk, so if anyone wants to jump online and book a session, it's

256
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,009
free. I go out to anywhere in Victoria. I'm going to New South Wales and Queensland on

257
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:10,650
weekends to educate people, sporting groups, corporate groups. And I'll talk to mums and

258
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,089
dads about the signs, about having good listening skills, about the statistics. Just trying

259
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:16,990
to make a difference, mate.

260
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,789
It's so important for me to use this opportunity to communicate.

261
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,970
To translate breaking to as big an audience as possible, because this is such a unique

262
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,009
moment. And also as a breaking, as part of the breaking community, you know, we learned

263
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:39,890
a lot of lessons from the early 1980s. There was not enough of an emphasis on what this

264
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,470
dance and culture was about. The term breakdancing being used is an example of that. You know,

265
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:50,650
it was used to describe a few different dance styles and didn't really take into account

266
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,170
the whole culture behind breaking.

267
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,150
So this is such an important opportunity for us. You know, with the visibility, we want

268
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,369
to have the explanation that goes alongside it of this is a culture. This is a culture

269
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:07,849
that started in the States, African-American and Puerto Rican kids. But we've also had

270
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:14,410
a scene here in Australia since the late 1970s. You know, there's many what we call OGs, you

271
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,930
know, like around still that would be able to tell some amazing stories of what the scene

272
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,309
was like in Sydney or Perth.

273
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:30,029
You know, Melbourne, et cetera. So it's really important to use this opportunity to communicate

274
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:35,230
what I think are the really important aspects of breaking at this time. Yeah.

275
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,250
Right. You mentioned earlier that you're turning up to competitions. There's 56 males, you

276
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,509
know, fully masculine and putting it out there. You're the sole female. That takes a fair

277
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,450
bit of courage, but I'm assuming collaboration has been a big part of how you've been able

278
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,869
to work your way through.

279
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,670
How important has the collaboration part been for you?

280
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:04,190
It's totally important. Breaking is a social dance as well as a competitive dance. So I

281
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,589
wouldn't have been able to do all that I've done without the support of my crew, which

282
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:15,710
is kind of like a self-made team, if you will, who always had my back at every competition

283
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:22,190
that I went to. You know, so these were intimidating situations that I was in only because I was

284
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,950
the only girl.

285
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,329
And only because I, you know, felt so different. You know, sometimes it'd be a bit in your face,

286
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:33,170
but not in a dangerous way. And it just was really nice to have their support always there.

287
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,450
The other way that collaboration is, of course, so important in breaking is because of the way

288
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,569
that we learn and the way that we train. So I only went to a studio for maybe about a year

289
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:48,710
to learn the basic techniques of breaking. The rest of the time, I've just been at my

290
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,930
training sessions with my crew and I would work on key skills or moves.

291
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,170
And I would, you know, work on going into the circle and practice. And my crewmates

292
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,950
would teach me. They would teach me because they've all been breaking, you know, a decade

293
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:07,990
at least longer than me. And they would teach me different moves and skills. And so it is

294
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,089
a very collaborative culture, very social, very collaborative. The knowledge is shared

295
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:17,430
and you're in this together. The same, you know, on the dance floor when you're battling,

296
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,910
there is that social exchange as well. So you are constantly kind of,

297
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,910
thinking about others as you're dancing. It's not just a solo activity.

298
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,910
Huge thanks to all of our guests featured on this episode. Dr. Troy Flanagan,

301
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,789
Leads Clues episode, we've put together the tips and strategies told to us by leaders across the

302
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:52,150
globe on how they positively impact people every day around them. If you enjoy listening to the
