1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,960
What a great privilege it's been recording the Empowering Leaders series and witnessing

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,980
these incredible moments unfold when you sit across from such a unique group of inspiring

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,800
leaders delving into the intricacies of their success.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,719
And in 2023, I hope you've felt like you've had a front row seat.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,460
I certainly have, to conversations that reveal how success leaves clues, featuring individuals

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,500
who've mastered their craft in a variety of different fields.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,179
At Alita, we recognize the consistent dimensions of brilliant leadership and the patterns that

8
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,920
emerge, and we're continuing our special series here where we explore them all and share them

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,259
with you.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,079
Every day, we see the superpower of collaboration, unlocking opportunities for people that they

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,619
could only have dreamed of in the past.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,799
Each week on the podcast, our conversations span diverse industries.

13
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:55,399
We love speaking to people from sport, from business, from education, from the arts or

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,060
social venture.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,100
Thank you.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,460
And in this episode, we've collected...

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,420
We've collected insights on collaboration from a small group of our guests who joined

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,280
me to share their wisdom, experiences, and leadership lessons, starting with the remarkable

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,739
Rochelle Courtney, the founder and managing director of Share the Dignity.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,879
Especially when you come to big global problems like what we're trying to fix, I think collaboration

21
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,840
is everything.

22
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,060
So we collaborate with three and a half thousand charities because we couldn't actually get

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,480
the period products to the woman who's living on the street or fled domestically.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,879
So it was really important for that collaboration piece to happen.

25
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,359
And then our volunteers collaborate with that charity and then make relationships with them.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,099
But we've even done that on a global scale.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,659
We held a global period poverty forum here in Australia with people who've been working

28
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,019
in this space around the world.

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,180
Never before have they all been brought together to try to work out how could we eradicate

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,799
period poverty around the world.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,700
So collaboration is our middle name.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,260
It is.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,980
About everything that we do, because we can't solve these problems on our own.

34
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:05,799
And I always think that 10 heads thinking about a problem is better than one.

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,699
In the same vein, we are passionate about collaboration.

36
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,500
We have a leadership business, a leader connect, and we connect leaders from around the globe

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,479
and so fascinated and passionate about collaboration.

38
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,159
If you could collaborate, Rochelle, with anyone on anything, is there a name that springs to

39
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,479
mind?

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,199
It might be in the Share the Dignity space.

41
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,819
It might be in another area of passion.

42
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,439
Is there someone that springs to mind?

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Brene Brown.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,639
I just, I mean, I've read everything, but for me and for a lot of women, there is such

45
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:43,419
a, you know, that whole piece around being in the arena and, you know, not thinking that

46
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:48,900
you are good enough to be where, you know, I will stand on the stage and accept an award

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,080
and I will absolutely be on the inside dying because I don't believe that I should be there.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,379
This imposter syndrome, no matter how much I try to overcome.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,479
And it is a real thing for women.

50
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,840
And I would love to work with her further on, not me, but all of our volunteers and women

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,439
in general.

52
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,400
Jeff Dimmery is CEO of Alinta Energy and one of the key people leading Australia through

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,639
the energy transition.

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,960
If I had one sort of desire, it would be to see collaboration on a global scale.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,080
So I'm talking about politics, unfortunately, now.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,180
And we kind of let East and West get in the way of one another.

57
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,520
I mean, I'll go out on a big limb here, but I don't think the US is going to invade China

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,280
anytime soon.

59
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,219
And I certainly don't think China is going to invade the US or for that matter, Australia.

60
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,280
And so I wonder about how much money gets spent on things like submarines and defense

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,060
and whatnot.

62
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:56,080
And, you know, whether we not be better investing that $360 billion in the energy revolution

63
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:56,979
that we're in.

64
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,639
And that needs to take place, you know, rather than protecting our borders, let's all work

65
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,819
together and save the planet.

66
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,659
If you want the ultimate collaboration, that's it.

67
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,639
Tara Winkler is an extraordinary Australian humanitarian and co-founder of the Cambodian

68
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,620
Children's Trust.

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,939
Her work in Cambodia has helped to shine a powerful light on the ineffectiveness of our

70
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,019
current model of international aid.

71
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,120
Collaboration is the backbone of everything that we do, local collaboration that is.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,500
And that was a real big challenge through COVID because everything that we do is done

73
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,800
in co-creation, in collaboration with the wider community.

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,839
That made it really difficult to do through COVID with all the lockdowns and things.

75
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,800
It's all done through collaboration with the wider community.

76
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,740
In the spirit of collaboration, and I love asking this question, in the space you're

77
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,600
in, have you thought about if I could collaborate with that person or that organization in any

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
area of your life, Tara?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,399
Clearly.

80
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,860
What the work you're doing is the passion that jumps out.

81
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,180
Has there been someone that you've thought that would be an ideal boost to the work that

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,480
you're doing?

83
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:05,959
Dream collaboration.

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,899
I mean, honestly, anyone really, like all the dreamers and rebels and renegades and

85
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,480
people who believe what we believe and willing to kind of collaborate and help us make it

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:25,459
possible, build a more fair, egalitarian world, I'd welcome any collaboration because it's

87
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:25,899
not.

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,199
It's not something that we can do alone.

89
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not a job for one person or one organization.

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,980
It is going to take an army of people to create systems change on that scale.

91
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,819
So the more, the merrier.

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,639
And I think sometimes we think that, you know, a job like that is kind of a utopian fantasy.

93
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,680
But, you know, if you think back through civilization, all of the major changes that were, you know,

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,639
democracy, the end of slavery, vote for women.

95
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,040
And gay marriage, they all, once upon a time, seemed like a utopian fantasy, so.

96
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,540
Coming up, you're going to hear from one of the most successful Olympians of all time,

97
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,980
Olympic swimmer Tracy Stockwell and Ivan Cleary, the coach of the Penrith Panthers, fresh from

98
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,720
a triple premiership success that is worth hearing more about.

99
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,779
I really loved hearing from Michelle Courtney, from Jeff Demery and from Tara Winkler and

100
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,959
their unique perspectives from different worlds.

101
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,899
Tara founding the Cambodian Children's Trust.

102
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,959
Jeff with his passion for the.

103
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,100
Landscape of energy in Australia and Michelle Courtney with Share the Dignity, quite remarkable,

104
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,720
but all passionate about how collaboration can take your efforts to a bigger, sometimes

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,800
global audience.

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,560
And in order to take on big challenges, the nature of collaboration really has a huge

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
impact when you get it right.

108
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,620
At Alita, we are really passionate about creating a world of collaboration, inspiring

109
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,639
connections and bringing together these diverse leaders from different backgrounds around

110
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,620
the globe to share, to learn, to connect.

111
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,600
We would love you to check out Alita Connect, our signature program.

Head to alitacollective.com.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,199
You don't have to be a global head of marketing for an international company or a superstar

114
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,540
coach to be part of Alita Connect.

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,620
We would love to book a discovery call, have a chat to us, and we'd love to share your

116
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,579
leadership journey with you.

117
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,319
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand

118
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,740
for their ongoing support for the Empowering Leaders podcast.

119
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:25,620
We know that getting a good night's sleep is a pattern that we see in all great leaders.

120
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,860
Temper is a mattress like no other.

121
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:28,959
Check it out today.

122
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:33,100
The next group of guests will speak to how collaboration has played a really vital role

123
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,579
on their path to success.

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,540
Let's go first to Olympic swimming legend Tracy Stockwell, one of the most successful

125
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,420
athletes in US sporting history.

126
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:49,240
I had noticed that women's sport wasn't really recognised as much back in the early

127
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,079
90s and the opportunities for girls and women weren't great.

128
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,639
And I had been involved in women's sport for a long time.

129
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,360
I was involved in America with the Women's Sports Foundation to try and raise the profile

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,759
of women's sport as well.

131
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:08,180
So we kind of got together and created Women's Sport Queensland and create more opportunities

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,379
and awareness about women and girls in sport because they were performing beautifully and

133
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,319
but just not getting the recognition.

134
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,540
And I think the papers and the media were giving more recognition to dogs and horses

135
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,620
than they were to women at the time.

136
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,379
And we tried to.

137
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,939
You know, work really hard to to change that and found a lot of good men who supported

138
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:36,580
us, whether it was corporate or through the media and often men with daughters who appreciate,

139
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,779
you know, they think, well, oh, this might be my daughter that might have an opportunity

140
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,639
if we do the right thing here.

141
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,240
So I think that was a really good strategy.

142
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:54,679
And so I've always loved trying to give back to sport because it gave me so much and really

143
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,480
proud of that.

144
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,019
And, you know, still catch up with lots of our founding members of Women's Sport Queensland.

145
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:08,059
And now you look at Michelle Payne, the in Rio, the women's teams doing so well, the

146
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:15,539
cricket team, the women's AFLW, the NRLW and how the opportunities for women have really

147
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,200
increased, which I'm really proud and like to think that we had a little bit to do with

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,399
that.

149
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,419
Collaboration is another thing we see people really value now more than ever and understand

150
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:25,620
the value of it.

151
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,000
How important has that been for you?

152
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,019
Oh, I think very important.

153
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:35,039
I think we're not, you know, alone and you can always do things better, I think, with

154
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,620
others.

155
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,399
And it also helps to have that support and people maybe sharing a different way of doing

156
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,279
something and coming up with a good outcome for everyone.

157
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,519
I think so.

158
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,759
And I think I'm pretty good at that.

159
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,259
I think and maybe I don't know if it's a female thing or but just mediating.

160
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,259
And monitoring and wanting.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,639
I'm a bit of a pleaser as well, I think.

162
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,240
So wanting to get a good outcome and making sure everyone has their say and then, you

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,580
know, bringing people together and coming to a common, you know, path.

164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,159
So I think that's very important to work together.

165
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,120
And as I said, I think Mark and I work together well as a team, whether it's in raising our

166
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,240
kids or running a business or our sporting ventures.

167
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Ivan Cleary is an icon of the NRL and head coach of the Penrith Panthers.

168
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:37,379
He's just led them to secure a trilogy of premiership victories in 2021, 22 and 23.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,120
How important has collaboration been for you?

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Everything.

171
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,440
Yeah, everything.

172
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,059
I love that style.

173
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,279
I love getting people's opinions.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,559
I get it.

175
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,840
You know, at the end of the day, most of the buck will stop with me on most things.

176
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,000
If not all of them, honestly, even though you're delegating all that at the end of the

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,039
day, like, as I said before, the performance of the team, that's with me.

178
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:00,659
That's on me.

179
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,759
But I love getting people's input.

180
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,620
You know, I love getting different views.

181
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,519
And then for me to be able to, from that, go, okay, this is where we're going to go.

182
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,399
I just think it's, I think that's one of the great things about coaching.

183
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,639
That's actually how you learn.

184
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,940
You just pick up little nuggets from people you least expect.

185
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,240
You know, it could be like an intern or something.

186
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,419
It could be anyone, you know.

187
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,639
And I just feel that's, yeah, I feel that's an essential part.

188
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,000
It's easier when you get older, I think, because it's easier to be a little insecure from time

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,379
to time.

190
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:36,519
And you feel like, oh, if I'm supposed to be the head coach, you know, like, I'm feeling

191
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,419
like this guy knows more than I do, or he's smarter than me, or, you know, that takes

192
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:46,299
a bit of time to be able to get over, I reckon, and just, you know, be able to, I guess, establish

193
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,539
that maturity and confidence.

194
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,000
And I feel like at the moment, I'm certainly at a better place there to be able to, you

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,759
know, collaborate properly.

196
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:59,820
I love listening back to Tracy Stockwell and Ivan Cleary, their unique success stories.

197
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,519
Tracy is one of the most successful Olympians of all time.

198
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,139
And Ivan Cleary, he is carving a path of success in the NRL like we've never seen before.

199
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,740
They both spoke about raising awareness through collaboration and shared vision and the possibilities

200
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,159
of getting to a point you hadn't thought of before, embracing collaboration early on and

201
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,720
not waiting until you feel like you have enough experience or confidence.

202
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,080
Huge thank you to all.

203
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,179
Thank you.
