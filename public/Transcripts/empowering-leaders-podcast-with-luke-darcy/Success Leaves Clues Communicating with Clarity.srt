00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,269
Felt like a great privilege to record so many engaging conversations with remarkable leaders

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,089
in this past year, uncovering their keys to success. In 2023, we'd like to think that we

3
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:20,170
gave you a front row seat to conversations that reveal how success leaves clues featuring guests

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,910
from across the globe at the top of their game. At Alita, we understand the consistent dimensions

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,010
of brilliant leadership and we love exploring them in this special series. The art of communicating

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,210
with clarity is an invaluable skill and one worth honing with practice and good advice.

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,969
Every week on Empowering Leaders, our conversations stretch across different fields from sport,

8
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,090
business to education, social venture and the arts. We love the diversity of thinking

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,329
and bringing that to the table each week. In this episode, we've curated what I think is a

10
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,670
remarkable group of individuals who take communicating with clarity very seriously

11
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,869
and they have a unique way of explaining why it works so well for them.

12
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,869
Starting with...

13
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:05,790
Susan McLean, Australia's foremost expert in the world of cyber security.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,250
Hopefully with clarity. It's interesting. One of the things I say when I speak to young people

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,129
is that, and I'll say at the start of my talk, I'm going to be blunt. I'm going to be direct

16
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:26,469
and there is no wriggle room in what I say. And for me, that's important because I need to share

17
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:32,250
really important facts and especially when I'm talking about laws. If I give any audience wriggle

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,909
room, I'm going to be blunt. I'm going to be direct. I'm going to be direct. I'm going to be blunt.

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,909
I know what they will do. They will twist it to suit them or they'll twist it to what they want to

20
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,730
hear. So then that's a failing as well. So if you leave my sessions confused, then I failed. So no

21
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:53,150
wriggle room. Here it is. Is it always fair? No. Is it factual? Yes. And you cannot expect any

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,069
person, particularly young people, to make or even try to make a good choice if they haven't

23
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:02,109
been given the facts. It's like saying, read this book, but we're going to test you on a different

24
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,409
one.

25
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:09,169
And hope for the best. And the cost of harm to young people that get themselves into situations

26
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,969
on the internet, get targeted, et cetera, is enormous. And we all have to do more to make

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,909
sure that, for me, every adult has a responsibility to try to keep all children safe online so that

28
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:27,569
children don't get mixed messages. It's like the good cop, bad cop parent. The child will go to the

29
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,030
good cop to get the lollies, but they won't ask the bad cop parent because they will say no. So

30
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,810
it's the same thing. You want them to get the same message from school, from home, from the sport

31
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,969
club, the co-curricular activity, from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, because consistent

32
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,169
messaging works.

33
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,150
Rod Campbell is a firefighter, a football coach, and a father of five who has dedicated his adult

34
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,110
life to helping people. Rod has created an education program called Learning Life Through Sport

35
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,849
that tackles bad parenting behavior in junior sport across Australia,

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,330
and the world. Yeah, I think you need to keep the message really simple,

37
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,990
but you need to be clear and concise, and you need to inspire high standards. So high standards

38
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,229
aren't only applicable to the highest level. High standards we can apply at any level. So you need

39
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,889
to have that about you or part of your makeup, so you have high standards when you're teaching. But

40
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:27,969
again, letting your passion and enthusiasm flow in specifically because I'm from a fire service

41
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,009
background, so as a station officer. So communicating with clarity is critical,

42
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,469
because they could be life and death situations. So an example of that would be you have a crew

43
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:42,689
working with you. You might go into a fire situation. So you'd explain, you discuss the

44
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,050
method of how we're going to control this situation, and then you discuss that with your

45
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,849
team. But then as you task them, you'd identify the task and then get them to repeat that task

46
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,669
back to you. Okay, so we've got absolute clarity on what we're doing. And then when they go in,

47
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,949
we know that they can perform that task or are aiming towards that goal. So that clarity,

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,289
it's super important in emergency services. So I guess that's where I learned that. But

49
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:13,569
when you talk about communicating with clarity, so in the road safety space, a little bit different.

50
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:18,470
So it'll be the key messages. So in RAP, the Road Awareness Program, we'd have the key messages

51
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,629
of, you know, you get to choose the risk, you don't get to choose the consequence. What we do

52
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,889
know is that most people will take what they feel emotionally away from that presentation,

53
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,610
and that'll give them the passion to go forward and want to be part of it. But what messages will

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,009
they remember?

55
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:37,110
So that consistency of that same saying. So we might say that saying 20 times during a

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,449
presentation, and it might be the one thing that they go away with. So keeping it simple,

57
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,569
reinforcing the message and understanding that people aren't going to take away lots of messages,

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,610
they might just take away a few. And if they take away the main ones that are going to empower them

59
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,970
to change their behaviours, they're really important. So that reinforcement of the message.

60
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,089
So I say to the parents, this is the new paradigm we're coaching under. These are the three values.

61
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,009
And in relation to respect, your children will no longer be able

62
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,310
to argue an umpire's decision. We'll teach it at training, we'll teach the reaction,

63
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,069
and I will never argue an umpire's decision as a coach. Can you guys support me? I'm talking to

64
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,910
the parent group now. Can you support me in doing this? Well, the parents look over at their kids

65
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,050
that they love, and they're looking over at me, the coach that hopefully they'll respect,

66
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:22,509
that's trying to bring good values to the game. Well, they're not going to say no in front of

67
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,730
their kids. So they make a commitment to their children who they love. They make a commitment

68
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,089
to the coach who hopefully they respect. They're also making a commitment with their cohort of

69
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:31,990
parents. They're also making a commitment to the coach who hopefully they respect. They're also

70
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:37,389
not going to say a word about umpire's decisions. So now we're all on the same page. So the coach

71
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,649
who, that's his job to coach, he's actually coaching the whole team. He's coaching the

72
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:45,750
kids and he's coaching the parents. And this is just one area of it. But I can tell you in four

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,550
years of coaching this same team, we have an unbelievable relationship with the players and

74
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,069
the parents. But my parents, they police that. I don't police their behavior. They know that's what

75
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,089
we're about. They want to be honest to their kids and they want to be honest to the coach.

76
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,610
So they're all supporting it. So we don't have issues from our parents. Honestly,

77
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:08,629
we don't, mate. And this can be taught. It's a taught behavior and we need to take that

78
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:20,319
responsibility. Richard Goida is the former CEO and managing director of Wesfarmers,

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,019
Australia's largest private employer. He's currently the chairman of multiple listed

80
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,160
companies and a key business advisory to the World Economic Forum.

81
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,519
I think I've, you know, there's been a journey, Luke. I've learned to be a bit more direct with

82
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:42,459
people without, hopefully without being sort of rude and impolite. So I can have very direct

83
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:50,160
conversations with people with, you know, whether it's Alan or Gil or Meg or directors, because I

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,399
think that clarity is important. Do I enjoy sitting down with someone and say, I think you did a

85
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:02,139
really rubbish job? No. You know, I don't know who enjoys that stuff. But have I learned to sit

86
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,680
down and say, actually, you know, you could have done that better. And these are what I,

87
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:11,839
you should have done. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was 20 years ago. And it's a

88
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,639
skill I think you sort of have to develop. But also, you know, I've also, I've had feedback

89
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,779
along the way that people have felt they weren't getting enough feedback from me. And I was shocked

90
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,980
when I got that feedback. I thought, oh, gee, I'm pretty good at that. And then I reflected on it

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,660
and said, actually, no, I'm not. I'm bloody hopeless at it in the circumstances I was

92
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,579
talking about. So yeah, hopefully I'm a bit better. It also comes with relationships,

93
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,360
I think. Once you, once you build trust with someone, you can have that much more direct

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,079
conversation. Coming up, we're going to hear from Australian lacrosse legend Stacey Morlang,

95
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,060
one of the most successful people in the world of real estate, Nathan Parris. Fascinating hearing

96
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,579
from him. And Hall of Fame NBA coach, George Carr. Really enjoyed hearing from Susan McLean,

97
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,199
from Rod Campbell and Richard Gorda, all from unique backgrounds. And they talk compellingly

98
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,680
about the thought of pulling no punches when delivering really crucial

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,480
information, the clarity required in an emergency, choosing your audience wisely,

100
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,079
and the time it takes to feel comfortable being direct. At Alita, we are really passionate about

101
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,819
creating a world of collaboration, inspiring connections, and bringing together these diverse

102
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,920

103
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,980
collaborate. We would love you to check out Alita Connect, our signature program. Head to

107
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,480
Nicholas and his team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand for their ongoing support of the

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,840
Empowering Leaders podcast. We know that getting a good night's sleep is a pattern that we see in

109
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,539
all great leaders. Temper is a mattress like no other. Check it out today. Really looking forward

110
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,399
to this next group and hearing them speak about how communicating with clarity has helped them on

111
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:10,519
a path to great success. Let's go first to Jeff Dimery, the CEO of Alinta Energy, a unique leader

112
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,519
in his own right and one of the key people passionate about leading us through this next big

113
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,799
energy transition. Keep it simple. I mean, we're very fortunate as leaders today with the

114
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:28,740
advancement in technology that we have. So the means to communicate, visuals, use a lot of

115
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,940
visuals. There's an old saying, pretend you're talking to intelligent 12-year-olds.

116
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,320
That's not meant to be demeaning to people, but the reality is that when, for instance,

117
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:46,759
if I'm giving an hour-long presentation, I've got to focus really, what are the three or four things

118
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,799
at the end of that hour I want people to remember? And make sure that you're clear about that,

119
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,700
you talk about it, you tell them you're going to tell them about it, then you tell them about it,

120
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,279
and then you tell them what you've told them, effectively. And like I said to you, Luke,

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,720
we've had the same strategy for 13 years. Our people get it now.

122
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,980
Um, and, and that's the value of consistency. Now, like I said, we'll play around with

123
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,320
the execution of that strategy and the emphasis within the strategy of what we're doing at a

124
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,720
point in time. But, um, we always need to be, um, true to ourselves and what it is that we're

125
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,500
trying to do, because it's at that level that our people understand what we are trying to do.

126
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,679
Stacey Morlang-Sullivan is an Australian lacrosse legend who still holds the NCAA

127
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:34,740
World Cup title. She's been a member of the Australian Lacrosse League for over a decade.

128
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:41,299
Division One record for the most goals in a game. She's a business owner, the co-founder of

129
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:46,659
Show and Tell, the online women's lifestyle brand, and co-host of their brilliant podcast.

130
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:54,100
All the time, particularly when you're coaching, I think, in sports and in other areas as well. I

131
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,799
think the most important thing for me is getting to know people well enough to know how they like

132
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,960
to be communicated with, because people are different now. Like it's not on a phone or

133
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,539
face-to-face. Some people don't like that.

134
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,320
It might be, you know, I remember, you know, leading players in this team that needed me to

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,100
go straight at them between the eyes. Just be better. This isn't good enough. But then another

136
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,919
person might need a different form of communication of, let me give a positivity first. And then,

137
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,120
so it's, I think it's about knowing how people want to receive communication and make sure that's

138
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,779
two-way. I don't, I don't think it can't, it can't be one way. Um, so learning about the language

139
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,340
they respond to best, I think is important there.

140
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:44,299
But for me, it's, I just lean on the truth always. I always lean on the truth because if I would never

141
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,679
want someone to wonder if what I said was true or not, or if I was just saying it to make them feel

142
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,580
good. But that goes back to building relationships so strong they can bear the truth. I think that

143
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,679
that's one of the most important things I lean on is truth. I think for probably two hacks I've

144
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,740
had that I use on the day-to-day, I think it's one of the most important things I lean on is truth.

145
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,080
Bailey almost is, or particularly when I was doing, you know, pregame speech, halftime,

146
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,820
you know, even in meetings, delivering things in meetings, whatever it was is

147
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:20,159
delivery over content. I used to spend so much time on the content I was delivering to the team,

148
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,460
like my halftime speech, my pregame speech, my this, my that, instead of how I was delivering

149
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,179
it to them. And that's like passion, body language, all those things that go into it is the cell.

150
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,740
I was watching literally Darcy yesterday, watching Kevin Hart,

151
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:44,500
talk about green super powder. But he was so engrossed in what he was saying because of the

152
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,340
way he was telling the story that I was like, I need to buy that. I didn't even hear what it was

153
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,840
about. It was just so captivating. And I know I have spent way too much time on content and not

154
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,879
enough time on delivery. So when I heard that, I was like, oh, this is what I need. Obviously,

155
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,980
the content needs to be good still.

156
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,360
But people are watching how you're giving it to them more than what you're saying.

157
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,139
And look, you know, there's the little things like I don't give more than three things in a

158
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:19,120
halftime or, you know, I don't give my kids more than one thing to do at a time. You know,

159
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:24,480
there's little ways to be clear and it's by not over speaking, not over coaching,

160
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,100
not over complicating, but also, you know, to just deliver something with a little bit of

161
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,879
gusto and it kind of goes a long way.

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,200
Nathan Paris is the managing partner of Emerge Capital, an independent real estate advisory firm

163
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,200
that has executed more than $30 billion worth of transactions over the last 15 years across

164
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,419
Australia, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. When you can actually crack through that and that

165
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:04,659
becomes the way you're operating rhythm, your efficiency goes through the roof. It's like a

166
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,480
vertical curve.

167
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,399
Because you're not trying to have to explain things. You say what you mean. If you're not

168
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,200
saying it fast enough, you'll be sped up to get to the point. And then we thrash out. We will

169
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,139
rigorously debate. If you weren't part of our organisation, you'd find that it was almost

170
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,720
offensive the way that we talk to each other. Not in terms of language, but like, what do you mean?

171
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,220
That doesn't make sense. You know, say what you mean. And then what happens is this just this

172
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,340
beautiful sort of cycle of ideas comes out of it.

173
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,320
And it gets tested at a rapid rate. And then all of a sudden, you've got a solution. And so it's

174
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,279
that it's not for everyone. But those guys that are in the team that can, can handle it, thrive in

175
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,639
it. And then they create that culture for the next generation to come through the organisation,

176
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,240
because we're literally plucking kids out of universe.

177
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,200
George Carl is a former professional basketball player who went on to become one of the youngest

178
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
head coaches in the world.

179
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:15,860
In NBA history, with a career spanning almost five decades and 1175 wins, the sixth highest of all

180
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,399
time, he was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame in 2022.

181
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:27,639
Well, you've got to be, you've got to be tough minded and caring at the same time. You know,

182
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,179
whatever you coach and whatever philosophies you have, they're fundamentals. And how you make them

183
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,000
teachable, acceptable.

184
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:46,080
And committed to is the beginning of coaching. We're teachers. We are mentors. We are psychologists.

185
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:54,759
But we are also friends. I don't think the old school of dictator, angry man, angry woman,

186
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,980
boot camp type of mentality is going to win anymore in coaching. Our players today are smarter.

187
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,279
They're wiser. And they more they know more stuff.

188
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,659
And then we know when we started to coach, when we started playing. The window of learning how to

189
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:22,919
motivate, how to inspire, how to connect, how to get out of the way, how to allow the process of a

190
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,779
team to come together. I think the best wisdom I had is what I said at the beginning of the show.

191
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,960
I mean, I've always believed in communication. But now it's more than communication. It's

192
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,340
connection. It's communication. It's communication. It's communication. It's communication. It's

193
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,820
connection. It's not only connection with the one-on-one between coach and player, but the

194
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:49,600
connection between what you are selling or what you are coaching to the team. Do they accept your

195
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,100
philosophies? Do you accept your demands? Do you accept your fundamental demands? And also,

196
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,200
do they accept your punishment? How you push them? How you push a button?

197
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:12,160
One of my favorite things is a pat on the back and a kick in the ass is six inches apart.

198
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,859
And that is so true in the game of sport. Some guys, they don't want to be kicked in the butt.

199
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,359
Other guys, that's all they want to be, is kicked in the butt. Everybody likes a pat on the back.

200
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:33,319
But when they go hard at them, when to be demanding, and knowing when to push those buttons

201
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,039
over a six-month period.

202
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,220
That season is probably as important as anything.

203
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,079
Love listening back to Jeff Dimry, the CEO of Alinta Energy, and his unique thinking,

204
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,519
Stacey Borling, who's joined our leader team. Nathan Parris is a brilliant individual and

205
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,099
NBA Hall of Fame coach, George Carl. And you can see the patterns emerging. Connection

206
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,079
is the new communication with something that I picked up a lot across the year.

207
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,259
Tailoring communication styles to effectively connect with individuals was something we heard

208
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,660
a lot about, and the benefits to culture.

209
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,880
It thrives on clear and candid exchanges. And when you don't get clear communication,

210
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,200
people fill in the gaps, often in a negative way. And the power of simplicity, that you need

211
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,279
to be able to condense your message in a way that isn't too complex, that people can remember and

212
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:25,339
then act on in a positive way. Huge thanks to all the guests that featured on this episode.

213
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,819

215
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:34,900
season, we're going to be talking about how to connect with people. So if you're interested in

216
