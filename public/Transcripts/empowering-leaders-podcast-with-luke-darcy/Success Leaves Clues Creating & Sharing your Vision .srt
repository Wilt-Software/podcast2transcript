1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,109
My vision is segregation is a scar on the community in which we live.

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,990
So I went away and I thought about, actually, what do I want to see?

3
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,609
And that became the vision.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,589
You're not going to get any help if you can't tell people what you want to achieve.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,329
So I kind of think vision is pretty important.

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,489
As long as you have that foresight to go, I want to get to that, it gave me a bit of drive.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:30,489
I always feel the great privilege to have sat down across from so many inspiring leaders in 2024 on the Empowering Leaders podcast,

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:37,429
talking about all the ways that success leaves a clue with people often at the top of their game in their chosen field.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,130
At Alita, we know that there are consistent dimensions of what brilliant leadership looks like,

10
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:44,850
and we're covering them all in this special series.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,990
We know that the ability to create and share a vision in a way that has impact is a very valuable skill,

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,009
but it's a skill within reach for anyone who puts their mind to it.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,149
Each week on the Empowering Leaders series, we hear from people across all industries,

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,250
whether that be from the world of sport to business.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,429
Education, social venture, and the arts.

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,569
And when it comes to the dimension of successfully creating and sharing a vision,

17
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,349
we have hand-selected a phenomenal group of people you're about to hear and learn from.

18
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,530
We'll hear from Andy Friend, one of the most respected coaches in world rugby,

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,290
former head coach of the Brumbies, Australian men's rugby sevens,

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,549
and he's recently launched Performance Friend,

21
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,870
a consultancy business supporting highly scrutinised leaders across their fields.

22
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:30,250
Kurt Fearnley joins us, the incredible Australian in every sense,

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,650
a wheelchair racer, a Paralympic gold medalist,

24
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:39,090
who also famously crawled across the treacherous Kokoda Track without a wheelchair.

25
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,090
A remarkable Australian in every sense of the word.

26
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,450
But first, we're going to hear from the legendary Nick Natanui,

27
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,250
whose legacy as an Australian rules footballer is as significant as anyone in the modern era.

28
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,409
The overall number two draft pick in 2008 of Fijian heritage,

29
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,709
went on to be a three-time All-Australian, a two-time West Coast Eagles best in Ferris,

30
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,709
and played without...

31
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,930
I've always been a big one on, you know, having a vision or having a goal,

32
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,710
and that probably is derived from my sort of mentors as a kid.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,189
Like my local youth worker, Tony Maracci, was a big one.

34
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,370
He used to take us out and teach us the right way on, you know,

35
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,449
he used to show us what's going on.

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,969
You know, there's guys doing drugs or, you know, doing bad things in the corner just down the road,

37
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,949
but there's a pathway to go and, you know, do what you want to do.

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,189
And myself, Chris, and Michael Walters, we all sat down and wanted to buy a...

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,909
our mum's houses.

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,650
That was our goal.

41
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,969
So having that vision to, you know, it was almost...

42
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,009
I thought it was unattainable.

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,750
I thought, you know, this is a bit far-fetched, man.

44
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,550
Like I just want to be able to pay...

45
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,930
help mum pay this week's rent and rent, not buy a house, you know, firstly,

46
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,370
but having that end goal and there's no straight line.

47
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,129
You just, you know, you're always diverting and there's ups and downs,

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,349
but as long as you have that foresight to go, I want to get to that,

49
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:53,889
it gave me a bit of drive.

50
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,969
And, you know, that's sort of what I do now.

51
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,710
I have a vision of what I want to get to.

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,069
And I think the biggest thing is understanding that,

53
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,150
you will fail at times.

54
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,969
And if I'm not going to get there, at least I've given it my all

55
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,449
and I knew I was doing the right things to put myself there.

56
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,930
I think I'd be more upset with myself if I didn't do that

57
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,710
and I fell short because I'd just be, you know, just floating through.

58
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,909
So having that vision has been big and sharing it as well

59
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,069
and letting people know what I'm about and what I want to do, you know,

60
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,669
helps open doors and helps you get to where you want to do

61
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,810
because people out there are willing to help.

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,669
So did you...

63
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,889
Sonny Walters and Chris Yaron,

64
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,689
there's kids talk about wanting to be successful enough

65
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:34,909
to buy your mum's houses to give them that security.

66
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,389
That's an amazing thing for kids to talk about.

67
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,169
Oh, it was awesome.

68
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,830
And it was our, you know, Frank Caviccio,

69
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,830
who was our junior coach and his wife Sharon

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,189
and Antonio Miracci, those guys, they put that in their heads.

71
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,990
They said, guys, you know, you can do what your cousins

72
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,370
or your mates are doing down the road and have an okay job

73
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,789
or you can be the first people.

74
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,069
And it was not only...

75
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,870
It was bigger than just buying a house for our family.

76
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,469
It was more being the first person in your family to buy a house.

77
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,229
That was a big thing.

78
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,310
No one, you know, no one in my whole family had been to university.

79
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,770
No one had bought a house ever.

80
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,949
So to be able to do that, and I got to do it, you know,

81
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,689
in my early 20s was...

82
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,810
That was bigger than any footballing moment, anything.

83
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,250
I still get into those boys because I got to do it first.

84
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,350
You know, I said, you just boys say, but you didn't say it properly

85
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,529
or your clubs weren't paying you right.

86
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,170
So I...

87
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,870
No, it was always something proud.

88
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,069
And, you know, once we'd all ticked it off, it was awesome.

89
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,730
Amazing.

90
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,470
So for me, I get the most pleasure from that.

91
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,649
Yeah.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,990
I'm so thankful that I was given a goal or a purpose to do it.

93
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,170
And now in life, I get the same thing, you know.

94
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,110
Like I said, it just gives me purpose to do what I do every day.

95
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,709
And I think footballers in particular should have that, you know.

96
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,050
Whether they want to buy a house for their family or buy a new car,

97
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,149
there's always a reason why you play.

98
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,089
Finding your why has been a big thing for me for so many years.

99
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,149
We're interested in vision and, you know, setting a vision is one thing,

100
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,610
but how could you pass on some advice on how you deliver a vision to a team?

101
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,449
That's something you've been doing for a long period.

102
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,889
Yeah, and it's probably something that I've always, up until recently,

103
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,129
Darce, I've struggled with, you know, that word vision.

104
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,629
What is it?

105
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,730
But I had the last, in my last contract with Connett,

106
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,529
so I had a three-year contract and then they offered me a two-year extension

107
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,569
and Kerry and I discussed it at length and I went back to the CEO

108
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,490
and I said, Willie, I'm happy to sign a two-year extension.

109
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,269
And he said, and he said, and what's your vision, friendly?

110
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,490
And I went to rattle something off really quick and he said, no, no, pause.

111
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,350
He said, I want you to look over your shoulder

112
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,449
now and imagine you're driving down away from the sports ground,

113
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:36,089
College Road, the sports ground was on a road called College Road.

114
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,529
You're driving down the sports ground at the end of your two-year tenure

115
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,170
and you look over your shoulder, what do you want to see?

116
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,189
And again, I went to race into something.

117
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,290
He said, no, no, no, go and have a think and come back and tell me.

118
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,170
He said, great question.

119
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,509
So I went away and I thought about actually what do I want to see?

120
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,129
And that became the vision.

121
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,050
The great Stephen Covey started at the end and worked back towards that.

122
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,350
So that's now exactly how I set my visions is I start with what it is

123
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,990
that I want to see at the end of it and then I start to share that with people.

124
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,050
So I can have the vision but how they can influence that

125
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,430
and their input into that is really important too.

126
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,170
So I make sure that it's a vision that, for example, one of the key part,

127
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,829
I want this to be a really safe place to work.

128
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,089
I want you to be able to walk through the door and just be you.

129
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,230
Is everyone comfy with that?

130
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,589
Friendly, that would be brilliant if we could do it.

131
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:27,850
Sweet.

132
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,370
So how are we going to do it, guys?

133
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,889
And then we start to layer on the steps that we need to do

134
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,009
to make sure that's going to happen.

135
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,850
What do you need from me for that to work?

136
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,069
What do I need from you?

137
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,290
What do you need from the other staff?

138
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,110
What does it need to look like when we win?

139
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,449
What does it need to look like when we lose?

140
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,970
What does it need to look like when we're 40 points down after 20 minutes?

141
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,930
What's it need to look like there that you're still safe?

142
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,389
And we just have these conversations and we build it ourselves.

143
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,689
It's not, you know, it's friendly's vision potentially

144
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,750
but it's a collective vision that we've agreed to.

145
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,930
But how are we going to live this out?

146
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,709
Everyone has input into that and over time that's when I've learned

147
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:04,750
that the best visions are actually, they come to reality.

148
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:08,189
I've had a really good team around me, a really, really,

149
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,850
really good team around me in everything that I've kind

150
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,550
of been able to be a part of.

151
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,870
Look, my vision is genuinely, I would say that I believe

152
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,689
that segregation is a scar on the community in which we live

153
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,269
and that whenever it exists we need to do everything possible

154
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,350
to make sure that it is.

155
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,350
That it is rid.

156
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,050
I think that telling stories that haven't been told in mediums

157
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,910
that allow the story to be told a little differently

158
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,569
is really, really important.

159
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,089
I love creating content and creating conversations

160
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,290
where people are invited into a space that they may not have heard

161
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,870
it voiced in that way before.

162
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,470
You know, I love Tiny Island.

163
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,149
I love You Little Ripper, which is a Paralympics podcast

164
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,149
where we just talk Paralympic sport.

165
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:56,870
I don't like that.

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:56,889
I don't like that.

167
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:56,910
I don't like that.

168
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:56,949
I don't like that.

169
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,009
I don't like that.

170
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,069
I don't like that.

171
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:57,329
I don't like that.

172
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,470
I don't like that.

173
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,509
I don't like that.

174
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,310
There's no other sport in there.

175
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,110
Never will.

176
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,189
You know, like AFL and then our World Grand Final,

177
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,350
not for our audience, my friends.

178
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,089
This is all sport for people with disabilities and it is, you know,

179
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:15,149
it is a wild world and one that is something that created, you know,

180
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,750
a big chunk of who I am.

181
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,370
I love to, I don't know, if I find a pathway that I believe

182
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,050
that it aligns with purpose, I love just chasing it

183
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,970
and just seeing where it leads.

184
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,069
I love chasing it.

185
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:34,529
And I could never, one of the, I guess I have FOMO to the ninth

186
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:35,809
or the hundredth degree.

187
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,070
I just hate the idea of seeing an opportunity in front of me

188
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:48,730
and not kind of, not shaking it as hard as I can and not making sure

189
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,909
that I've seen the view on the other side of that mountain

190
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:56,929
or I've gave that, you know, that pathway a hell

191
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:57,490
of a shake.

192
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,470
We are really privileged to have many of the guests that you hear

193
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,970

We bring together groups of five to six people from around the globe

196
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,549
from unique and diverse backgrounds who come together to learn

197
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:13,850
and to connect and to share.

198
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:17,610
We are really passionate about what happens when you connect

199
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,710
great people together in a really trusted environment.

200
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,690
We'd love to tell you more about it.

Head to elitacollective.com and book a discovery call with us today.

202
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,549
We are super proud to be working alongside one

203
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,750
of the world's great learning institutions, Victoria University

as our support partner in 2025.

205
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,889
No one sees you like VU.

206
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,549
Victoria University is uniquely you.

207
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,009
We see a lot of great synergy between the world

208
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,029
of Victoria University and our passion for the world of Elita

209
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,309
and the Empowering Leaders podcast.

210
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,590
This episode is also proudly brought to you by Temper mattresses,

211
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:51,990
adjustable bases and pillows.

212
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,549
The difference is Temper.

213
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,649
The next group of guests will all speak about their unique approach

214
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:56,669
to the world of Elita.

215
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,909
Their unique approaches of creating and sharing their vision.

216
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,789
On a daily basis, we'll hear from Belinda Stowell,

217
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,110
an Olympic gold medal winner from the Sydney Olympics

218
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,090
who now leads other athletes to Olympic and World Championship glory.

219
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,629
The Honourable Will Ulstergan, the Chief Justice of the Family Court

220
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,370
of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court,

221
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,269
which puts him at the coalface of family and gender-based violence

222
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,610
in Australia, an issue he tirelessly campaigns against

223
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,429
in and out of the courtroom.

224
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,370
But first, let's go to the remarkable Vanessa Ford,

225
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,649
Chief Operating Officer.

226
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,669
Vanessa Ford, Chief Operating Officer of Kukua,

227
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,750
a Kenyan-based education entertainment company

228
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,870
that has a primarily female executive team

229
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,669
and the executive producer of the first African animated superhero series,

230
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,789
Super Seema, where the main character, Seema,

231
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,429
is an African superhero whose superpower is using her mind

232
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,009
and science and technology.

233
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,490
Whereas I used to be the person who would be, you know,

234
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,889
the first on set in the morning and the last person to leave

235
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:55,629
after midnight, now I have something not only to go home to,

236
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:56,649
but have something to go home to.

237
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,330
Having a baby, you know, that baby needs their mom.

238
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,049
But here's something that people don't really say enough

239
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:08,789
is that actually that, like, mom needs their babies too, right?

240
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,429
And I feel like when I became a mom, I was like,

241
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,370
I actually want to be present.

242
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,190
I want to be there.

243
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,789
I don't want to be jumping on a plane to Malaysia

244
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,250
to save, you know, a production or, you know,

245
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,629
putting out fires and all of these different worldwide productions.

246
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:34,710
And I realized that, actually, what can I do to give this next generation,

247
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,129
i.e. my own children, something that I never had?

248
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,889
And I grew up, you know, turning on the television,

249
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,950
opening a magazine, and I never saw anyone with my color skin,

250
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,669
my big afro.

251
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,629
I never had that opportunity to, like, look at myself,

252
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,549
as a six or seven-year-old, as a hero.

253
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,429
You know, thankfully, I had a, I walked into my house

254
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:10,330
and I had my mom, I had my aunt, I had Auntie Oprah on television.

255
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,289
But those were really the only role models I had.

256
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,009
And then when I took the trajectory of science and biology and physics,

257
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,190
you know, I never had a teacher that looked like me.

258
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,809
I was often, and so I thought, wow, what if this superhero

259
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:30,450
was not only a little Black girl, but what if she,

260
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,750
her superpowers were the things that I think superpowers are,

261
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,409
which is science, technology, engineering, arts and math,

262
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,129
the whole STEAM framework.

263
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,730
So I was just, I got really excited about this idea

264
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,610
and about making sure that this next generation of children

265
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,690
would be watching and consuming things that could empower them.

266
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,610
And I think as storytellers, we have that, yeah,

267
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,309
we have that obligation to really change the narrative.

268
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,570
Like that's, like, it's our agenda.

269
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,309
We have, we are given that position.

270
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:08,870
We're given that platform.

271
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:13,049
Rather than just putting out another thing that's already there,

272
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,490
I felt SuperSama was like the culmination of all of these different threads

273
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,450
of my life as well, coming together, you know,

274
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,230
working still in the entertainment space, being able to pull out my old Hollywood

275
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,730
contacts.

276
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:25,789
Yeah.

277
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:31,389
To, you know, rope in, you know, superstars like Lupita Nyong'o

278
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:35,889
and getting them involved, you know, you can go through life positively accepting

279
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,809
and being like passive and being used as part of someone's vision and purpose,

280
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:46,389
or you can really claim space to be who you are and go through life

281
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,129
according to your own agenda.

282
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,629
And I think that being a Black woman, and especially, you know,

283
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,269
when I was working in a more corporate structure,

284
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,570
I think there's a certain amount of going against the grain that you feel every day,

285
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,570
even just being present, like particularly when your goal is to be fully authentically

286
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,909
true to yourself.

287
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:13,169
So it does feel like you're claiming and reclaiming your space.

288
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,470
And I think for me, SuperSama was a bit of that as well.

289
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,909
You know, I think, yeah, I think the whole kind of claiming culture,

290
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:25,110
that term kind of came back into popular lexicon when Maxine Waller,

291
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,509
one of my daughters, very publicly in the hearing said, you know,

292
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,309
I'm reclaiming my time, and she kept repeating it.

293
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,649
And there was something so powerful about this older Black woman within a

294
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,610
judicial system telling a room full of white men that, you know,

295
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,149
I'm reclaiming my time.

296
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:50,070
So I think there's something about reclamation and claiming that felt very

297
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,309
relevant and triumphant.

298
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,190
And yeah, I want that.

299
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,190
And I want to do that.

300
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:02,649
And I want to move through my life, claiming and reclaiming what I think I deserve and

301
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,610
what I want.

302
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:09,909
And I think SuperSama reflects that decision and also to become an entrepreneur and to

303
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,710
say no to other offers.

304
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,929
You know, I could have transitioned from one big Hollywood studio to another, and I

305
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,110
really decided to say no, because I felt like I would, I didn't want to be owned or to

306
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,710
be claimed.

307
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,149
I wanted to do something for myself.

308
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,450
I wanted to do something for my family.

309
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,610
I wanted to build that legacy.

310
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,590
And I think my vision has always been so big.

311
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:37,990
You know, I've never been someone who's just like, oh, I want to get from here to there.

312
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,789
It's like, no, I want to change the world.

313
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:48,970
And, and, and getting people to jump on kind of our Kukua rocket ship that I like to call it and like

314
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,110
blast off without, you know, leaving other careers and, and I think has been a

315
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,230
testament to that has been like, we literally, we will in the SuperSama office, we have a

316
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,929
wall of all these women that we really believe in.

317
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:09,889
And we had Lupita up there, we had Serena, we had Oprah, and, and it's still there.

318
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,490
We had all these pictures of all these women that we, and we always said one day, these

319
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,610
women are going to walk through this office.

320
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:23,009
And just the fact that we've had, you know, not only some of those women walk in our office,

321
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,509
but some of them support us.

322
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:24,990
Some of them.

323
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,090
Yeah.

324
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:31,230
Being investors, some of them being a part of our company and like believing in our vision.

325
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,110
That is like, that says it all.

326
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,610
I was talking to a sports psych once about what I was trying to do.

327
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,450
And, you know, he spent 45 minutes trying to ask me what I wanted to do.

328
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,490
And I didn't want to say, look, I want to go and win an Olympic gold medal in Sydney 2000.

329
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,830
But finally, after 45 minutes, he made me get it out.

330
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:54,990
But it was, I was talking to another psych a few years later and he said, well, basically

331
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,929
he only made one decision in five years.

332
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:03,629
I said, well, that's pretty, pretty true because everything, once you have a vision, everything

333
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:09,069
and behind it makes sense and coincidences start happening because you've got this decision

334
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,809
that you know where you want to go.

335
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,329
And I think vision is also important when running the program to be able to have a great

336
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,509
vision of where do I want to be in five years time?

337
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:24,470
Because what we're doing now is the result of what we were doing five years before or

338
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,990
what the athletes were being trained up five years before is pretty much what we're looking

339
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,450
at now.

340
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,730
So to have a good vision, you need that for the collaboration piece as well, to be able

341
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,849
to bring people along or to show and share what your vision is.

342
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,369
You're not going to get any help if you can't tell people what you want to achieve.

343
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,150
So I kind of think vision is pretty important.

344
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,650
A couple of big visions, uniting a couple of courts, as you said, with all the complexities

345
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,309
of that and now being someone at the face of a campaign to try and stop this.

346
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,230
National disgrace of violence against women.

347
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,769
How have you gone about creating and sharing visions of that scale?

348
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,009
What's been your method for that?

349
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:06,069
I think internally with my own team and getting people who are really inspirational, I think

350
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:10,170
I sort of, like a lot of people, I think you react if you've got positive people around

351
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,390
you.

352
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,170
And my team are incredibly positive.

353
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:13,549
They're visionary.

354
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,789
They're probably pretty patient with some of those silly ideas I have.

355
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,170
I'll give you one example.

356
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,829
Last year, just before The Voice, I think a lot of people were hearing terrible things

357
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,069
about what was happening in Alice Springs.

358
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,349
And it was mainly...

359
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:25,789
I think some misinformation.

360
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,470
I was really inquisitive as to what was happening and how we could support that community.

361
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,009
We have a once a year judges meeting.

362
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:33,849
It was meant to be in Melbourne.

363
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,730
And I said to my poor events organiser, Alex, look, I want to take 120 judges, cancel Melbourne.

364
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:40,789
We're going to Alice Springs.

365
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,369
It's not an easy place to fly into.

366
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,130
I rang the security officer and said, got any problems?

367
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,809
And he said, oh, no, it should be fine.

368
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,150
Thinking, oh my gosh, what are you doing?

369
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,349
And sure enough, six or eight weeks later, we were up in Alice Springs.

370
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,250
We spent three days up there.

371
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,329
We talked to the local people.

372
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,289
Went to the town camps.

373
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,109
Went to the communities.

374
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:02,069
And 120 judges got experiences they never had before about how Indigenous people live

375
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,329
in some of these communities, what the effects it can have on them from a legal system, what

376
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,750
they understand and don't understand, and really the challenges they face being part

377
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:17,210
of our community or part of our litigation system and how unfair it can be on them.

378
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,190
Now, we left that message just because I thought, you know, what, we're just going to go up

379
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,769
there and see it.

380
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,190
And it was one of the best things we ever did.

381
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,190
We had Eastern...

382
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:28,569
We had a lot of state judges who'd never been in a community before spending time in there

383
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:33,230
and talking to people about it, what they felt, the kind of misinformation or some of

384
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,049
the information that was going on, and just the education we were able to obtain from

385
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:38,289
that.

386
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,750
That's just sort of one idea.

387
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,369
But it was just great to be able to change the course and think a bit laterally.

388
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,369
During COVID, we were locked down like everybody else.

389
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,130
We decided with our courts, with the backlogs and other things that were happening, and

390
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,410
I think I spoke to you a little bit with John Triple M about it, we had to get the message

391
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:53,769
out.

392
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:54,329
Yeah.

393
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,970
People weren't alone, and if they couldn't see their kids, it was border disputes and

394
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,730
all sorts of other things.

395
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,349
They could vary their arrangements in a safe way.

396
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:05,849
I remember going on the radio, getting in the television and saying, calling people

397
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,970
out and saying, listen, we haven't shut down.

398
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,769
We're still open for business, and we can help you in making some suggestions.

399
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:15,930
We started a COVID-19 list so people could get to the court really easily.

400
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,890
We made sure that if women were in crisis, they could actually contact us through phone

401
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,730
numbers and through video hearings that they couldn't have done before.

402
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,690
We worked with the women's legal services.

403
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,170
We were just fantastic, and the men's legal services, and we probably revolutionized the

404
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,890
court and nationalized the court in a way we never would have had to before.

405
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:40,029
I loved going into that courtroom every day during COVID and doing these things.

406
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,250
Most courts went down about 40% of what they were doing during COVID.

407
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,769
We were at 105%.

408
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,029
We just smashed it, and it was great because we were just so enthusiastic to do it, and

409
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,130
that's all these judges.

410
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,650
Imagine getting a whole aging population of judges and saying to them,

411
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,009
in two weeks' time, you're going to do total electronic hearings.

412
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,309
If I'd said in two years, they wouldn't have believed me.

413
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:00,230
They all did it.

414
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,089
Then they started competing at who could do it better.

415
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:08,009
It was a great time, and I think, realistically, that's the kind of environment I want to work

416
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,730
in, and I expect people to work in.

417
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,990
Huge thanks to all the guests featured on this episode, to Nick Natanui, Andy Friend,
