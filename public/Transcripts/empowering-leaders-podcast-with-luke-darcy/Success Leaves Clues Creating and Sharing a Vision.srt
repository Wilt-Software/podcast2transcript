1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,140
Well, what a great privilege it has been to sit down across from so many inspiring people

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,099
in 2023 for the Empowering Leaders podcast.

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,260
And we talk often about the fact that success leaves clues with people at the top of their

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,739
game and in their chosen field.

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,000
Certainly learnt a lot from a remarkable group of people last year in 2023.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,519
At Alita, we know that there are consistent dimensions of what brilliant leadership looks

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,579
like, and we're going to cover them all in this special series.

8
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,780
We know that the ability to create and share a vision in a way that has impact is an incredibly

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,840
valuable skill, but it's a skill within reach for everyone who puts their mind to it.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,780
Each week on the Empowering Leaders podcast, we hear from people across all industries,

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,240
from sport, from business, education, social venture, and the arts.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,899
And when it comes to the dimension of successfully creating and sharing a vision, we've hand

13
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,340
selected some phenomenal people from this group you're about to hear from and learn

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,280
from as we go.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,560
I want to start with an AFL.

16
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,679
I want to start with an AFL legend, Michael Voss, one of the greatest players that I've

17
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,819
ever seen play the game.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,319
Ruthless in some ways, but a very passionate leader on the field.

19
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,140
And he's really evolved his style of leadership over the time to a very successful new generation

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,319
of young men at the Carlton Football Club.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,140
Have a listen to the great Michael Voss.

22
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:27,000
What's actually really important at the start is that everyone has a say on the way forward.

23
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,000
If there's one thing I've learnt about...

24
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,920
You know, groups now is that they want to belong to something and they want to own something.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,879
And having a say on that direction actually really inspires them to want to be a part

26
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,099
of it.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,480
So at the start, it was quite literally, I said to the players, how do you want to play?

28
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,780
Let's scribble it down.

29
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:45,719
Let's write it down.

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,739
And they're not far off.

31
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,680
They're smart guys.

32
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,780
They know their footy.

33
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,400
And then, you know, asking, I guess, then permission, which sounds like a silly thing

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,519
to do because that's your job, right?

35
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,040
I was like, oh, can we take that away?

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,019
And as coaches, we'll come up with something and we'll come back to you and let's work

37
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,560
through the language.

38
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,060
And let's really sort of hone in what really sort of sits well with you.

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,319
And so that's what we did.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,739
As coaches, we went away.

41
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,060
We formulated some plans.

42
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,180
We formulated some principles.

43
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,400
We come back.

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,219
We check with the group.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,900
What do you think?

46
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,719
Yeah, we love it.

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,719
We go back again.

48
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,560
Okay, can we put some structure in that?

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,780
Can we put some roles around that?

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
What roles would that look like?

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,819
And then sort of your themes start to emerge out of that.

52
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,219
So I feel if you can have that approach and the players can buy into it and they all own

53
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,300
it, when you come back as a coach and say, hang on, didn't we all, it's not going, didn't

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,419
we say...

55
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,680
Hey, we're all in on this.

56
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,460
It has much more power.

57
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,580
It has much more meaning rather than it's just the coach's idea.

58
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,919
And it's just the coaches that are running the schedule and we just follow what they

59
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,240
do.

60
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,659
It's important to bring them along on the journey.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,879
But also what's really important is that using as many opportunities as you can is to show

62
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,819
or talk about your vision and talk about what it should look like.

63
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,080
Because I think we want that.

64
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,919
We want to see what it looks like.

65
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,319
But also then how is it relevant for what I'm doing right now in the moment today?

66
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,560
And that's what all the...

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
Research says, of course, if you co-create it with the team and they are in part of the

68
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,280
process of determining their own vision, it's just so much more pet sticks, doesn't it?

69
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:09,539
Yeah.

70
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,219
If you come in over the top and just it's your words and not theirs.

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,780
So...

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,860
Yeah, I love that co-create.

73
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:16,900
I love that co-create.

74
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,460
And even just with the training environments, what we try to do is try and enable them to

75
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:27,300
be able to problem solve and have those conversations about what's working and what's not working

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,180
and skill our leaders to be able to have those conversations.

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,259
Because there's no stronger conversation than peer conversation and them getting on the

78
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:35,800
same page.

79
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,759
So we certainly haven't perfected that.

80
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,939
We're nowhere near by any means the finished product on it.

81
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,379
But there are some of the things that actually are really important to us in our environment.

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,599
Richard Oppie is Vice President of Global Brands for the largest consumer goods company

83
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,439
in the world, making his role arguably the biggest marketing job in the world.

84
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,539
His company is responsible for leading beer brands,

85
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,120
including Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois, and many more.

86
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:12,539
When I think of a vision, one that springs to mind is the marketing leadership team.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,079
So that was when I, 2017, I remember we were in Mexico.

88
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,819
We had our global marketing leadership team conference.

89
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,720
And we had this conversation.

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,639
We were like, I'm sick of being known as a zero-based budgeting company.

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,120
I'm a company known for mergers and acquisition.

92
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,560
Why aren't we renowned as a marketing company?

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,120
A company that can grow organically, top line.

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,300
Because there aren't many more other companies to buy where we're going to be able to take

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,839
the synergies and increase our bottom line.

96
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,120
We need to start driving top line growth.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,160
And so there were lots of debates at the time.

98
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,180
And we decided, you know what?

99
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,360
We want to be the best marketing team in the world.

100
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,019
And we decided, how are we going to measure that?

101
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,240
And really, the two big measures were like,

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,300
we want to be known as the creative marketer of the year at Kahn,

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,279
which is probably the biggest reward you can get,

104
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,959
the biggest award for marketers in the world.

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,120
And then we also want to be the most effective marketing company in the world,

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,860
which is the Effies Index.

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,879
And so it's been a big five-year journey.

108
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,379
And it hasn't been a fluke.

109
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,100
So we've sort of put systems in place.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,300
And it really came down to, we call it the three Ps.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,079
So people.

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,220
Sorry, for those listening before,

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,579
you've just won those awards on a global scale,

114
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,759
which is a remarkable achievement to put you competing with the Nikes.

115
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,819
And they're the previous winners.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,959
Sorry, before you continue on.

117
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,220
Yeah, it was this year, we sort of had all-time volume high.

118
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,500
So the highest volumes we've ever had at the company.

119
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:52,019
Our brand equity, which we call brand power, is at an all-time high.

120
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,339
And this year, we won creative marketer of the year at Kahn.

121
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,220
And number one for the most effective,

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,620
marketing company in the world.

123
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,500
So you talk about dreaming big.

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,060
Five years ago, we were ranked 42nd.

125
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,519
And we said we wanted to be number one.

126
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,279
And people laughed at us at first.

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,220
AB InBev, you're an M&A company.

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,139
And we're like, no, we're going to be the best marketing company in the world.

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,540
And credit to the team that have been involved.

130
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,480
Miguel Patricio was our CMO at the time.

131
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,379
And he really led the way to foster this creativity across the entire organization.

132
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,060
And he put the right people in place that were modern marketers.

133
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,420
And then we created culture and capabilities team across all our markets.

134
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,019
And then we put processes in place.

135
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,839
So we created like a creative spectrum, the way we talk about the work from a one to a 10.

136
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,519
And we set up like a brain trust.

137
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,579
We would have external and internal people to talk about the work, to make the work better.

138
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,379
And then we sort of overhauled our partners.

139
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,839
We got the best people around us, the best agencies around us.

140
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,899
And having those all set up, you know, it wasn't just one country that was being recognized.

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,040
We had basically all our countries around the world being recognized as the best marketers in the world,

142
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,379
which ultimately became the global company.

143
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,139
So it's been something that I've been privileged to be part of this team.

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,920
And it's been an incredible journey.

145
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,819
Andrew Gaze is the greatest name in the history of Australian basketball.

146
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,740
As a five-time Olympian, he was Australia's flag bearer

147
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,519
at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney.

148
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Well, for me, and that depends on the circumstances,

149
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,980
whether it's family, whether it's business, whether it's the sport, coaching,

150
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:58,480
all those different things, is always going in there and appreciating that we're all different.

151
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,480
And the way in which people will approach certain environments or challenges,

152
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,019
can sometimes be different.

153
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:17,360
Accepting that sometimes a preconceived idea on how things should be done,

154
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,319
as opposed to being open-minded and being objective about other suggestions,

155
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,439
I think can be detrimental.

156
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,779
Now, you might always come back,

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,980
and you might come back to your own preconceived idea about a certain thing,

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,720
but not having an openness and a willingness to take on the challenge,

159
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,279
and a willingness to explore and see that there are always alternatives out there.

160
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,860
Progress is made by innovation and new things all the time.

161
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,120
And one of the gross criticisms of me is Gaze sits on the fence.

162
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,340
Gaze sits on the fence.

163
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,440
He never makes a decision.

164
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,460
No, no, no.

165
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,720
Gaze doesn't sit on the fence.

166
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,740
Gaze has...

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
I love him in a third person, Gaze.

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,539
But what I try to do is understand that,

169
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:07,179
no, no, I've got an opinion, I've got a view,

170
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,059
but I'm not going to dismiss someone else's view until I understand it,

171
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,539
appreciate it, make an assessment on it, and then go,

172
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,220
no, that's for me.

173
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,559
I come into situations often with a predisposed position,

174
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,019
but that doesn't mean you can't change.

175
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,100
And I think that approach to leadership, I think, is really important.

176
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,179
Why?

177
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:33,379
Why?

178
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:33,419
Why?

179
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:33,440
Why?

180
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,500
Why?

181
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,539
Why?

182
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:33,600
Why?

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,620
Why?

184
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,860
Why?

185
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:33,879
Why?

186
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:33,899
Why?

187
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:33,960
Why?

188
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Why?

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,019
Why?

190
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:34,080
Why?

191
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,139
Why?

192
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,200
Why?

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,259
Why?

194
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:34,840
Why?

195
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:34,899
Why?

196
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:34,919
Why?

197
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,000
Why?

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,019
Why?

199
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:35,039
Why?

200
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,080
Why?

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,100
Why?

202
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,220
Why?

203
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,279
Why?

204
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,320
Why?

205
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,759
There are times where I can be, as a coach, highly dictatorial,

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,259
and that would fly in the face of everything I just said,

207
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,399
but that's in the moment.

208
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,179
So, we've made a decision.

209
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,500
We're going to run this play, and in order for us to have the best chance,

210
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,580
we are running, and if you don't do it, I'm going to hold you accountable to that.

211
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,200
Now, after we've gone through it, we look at the statistical data,

212
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,860
we check out over a sample size.

213
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:03,919
We've done that.

214
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,059
we've gone through all the process, and you've shown me

215
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,620
and demonstrated, well, there's an alternative, absolutely.

216
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,960
Let's make that change, and then we'll incorporate those things.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
But a lot of, especially from a coaching standpoint, this is it.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,580
I'm doing this, come hell or high water, because I know it's been successful.

219
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,379
I'm going to do it, and I'm going to teach you how to do it,

220
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,059
and that is all there is to do with it.

221
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,399
Well, there's a time and a place for that.

222
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,379
But you also have to be open-minded enough to understand

223
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,860
and consider alternatives.

224
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,759
Coming up, we're going to hear from Olympic gold medal winner Steve Hooker

225
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,379
and his unique style of thinking, soccer star Harry Kuehl,

226
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,360
one of the great players in Australian sporting history.

227
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,440
And as Michael Voss, Richard Oppie, and Andrew Gaze share,

228
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,779
there is real power in dreaming big, bringing people along for the ride

229
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,679
and being open-minded, even if you already feel like you've got an idea

230
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,519
of the best way forward.

231
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,399
At Alita, we are really passionate about creating a world of collaboration,

232
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,080
inspiring connections, and bringing together these diverse leaders

233
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,639
from different backgrounds around the globe to share, to learn,

234
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,100
to connect, and to collaborate.

235
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,139
We would love you to check out Alita Connect, our signature program.

Head to alitacollective.com.

237
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,679
You don't have to be a global head of marketing for an international company

238
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,100
or a superstar coach to be part of Alita Connect.

We would love to book a discovery call, have a chat to us,

240

and we'd love to share your leadership journey with you.

241
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,899
Big thanks.

242
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,879

245
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,480
in all great leaders.

246
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,419
Temper is a mattress like no other.

247
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,500
Check it out today.

248
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,580
This next group of guests all speak to how the power of creating

249
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,799
and sharing a vision with your team has led them to a life of great success.

250
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,639
Let's go first to Elizabeth Broderick AO,

251
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,779
Australia's longest-serving sex discrimination commissioner,

252
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,539
and now an independent expert on the United Nations Human Rights Council,

253
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,220
working on laws and practices that discriminate against women.

254
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,779
Sharing the vision is about engaging people's both their heads and their hearts.

255
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,360
I mean, what I learned early on is you could share all the data

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,419
which supported your vision.

257
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,100
My vision is for a much more gender-equal world,

258
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,519
a kinder, more compassionate world, a prosperous world for sure,

259
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,519
but one where everyone has.

260
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:37,580
A place everyone's valued, treated with dignity and respect.

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,700
And to get people along on that journey often means that they need to shift.

262
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,899
Now I can put all the data about, you know, the gender inequality stats.

263
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,220
You know, women are paid less, they're experienced more violence.

264
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,820
They're sexually harassed more, all that data that will never be enough.

265
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,700
What I need to do is engage people's hearts and I do that through the,

266
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,120
I mean, just that story that I told then and read verbatim, that letter.

267
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,919
It's the stories of human harm that are happening in this moment.

268
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,299
If I can engage you on that, then I think you will more,

269
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,960
be more likely to step up with me on my vision of a gender-equal world.

270
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,080
Because change usually happens not by taking a giant leap.

271
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,220
It happens by adding, adding to, continuing, adding more.

272
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,759
All these things.

273
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,679
Small nudges and really about healing the part of the world that touches you,

274
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,899
that's around you.

275
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,980
And to do that, you have to get proximate to the issues and listen to the stories

276
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,740
or what I, what I call the other voices, the voices that are outside, usually your remit.

277
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,399
Um, so to get people to come on board with my vision, um, I'm helping

278
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,879
them get proximate to the human harm.

279
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm investing in storytelling.

280
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,679
I'm engaging both.

281
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:02,740
Yeah.

282
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,080
And then helping them see what part they can play in creating, um, you know,

283
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,179
creating this more, more gender equal world.

284
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,580
And actually I, I love the work, um, that I think it's, um, just trying to remember,

285
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:22,320
uh, the guy who wrote the, um, uh, a humor Chi, it was, uh, he's written a lot, but his

286
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,019
new book was on the kindness pandemic.

287
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:32,639
And he said there, look, if we, if we, if we, if we, if we, if we, if we, if we, if we, if

288
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,500
we dare to dream of a more loving country, a kinder, more compassionate, more

289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,320
cooperative, more respectful, um, country, then there's really only one

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
way to turn that dream into reality.

291
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,539
And that is that each of us must live our lives of if, as if that country

292
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:57,399
already exists, because if enough of us do that, then that country will exist.

293
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,519
And, and I love to, you know, kind of move along in, in

294
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,639
that vein to help others see that if we just shift a little bit and live in that way, then

295
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,940
we will create this vision of a more gender equal Australia family nation.

296
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,259
Steve Hooker is an Olympic track and field gold medalist and the first Australian man

297
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:28,740
to hold both Olympic and world championship titles concurrently his incredible commitment

298
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,340
and work ethic has seen his outstanding success in sport.

299
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,620
Replicated in his business career.

300
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,019
There's a huge difference between having your own vision and then turning that vision

301
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,019
into a shared vision by broader group.

302
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,559
Like that's, that's a really hard thing to do.

303
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,700
And I probably didn't understand how hard that was at first.

304
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,980
I assumed you tell people once, and then we're all saying the same thing and we're

305
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,080
all running in the same direction.

306
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,600
And that just couldn't be anything further from the truth.

307
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,220
Even if you do one beautiful presentation that really shows people like that, everyone

308
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,100
interprets it, interprets things so differently.

309
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,740
And then also like having a really clear back to purpose plan vision, breaking that down

310
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,759
to the simplest plan.

311
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,399
So everyone can say each day, what the element is that you're working on, how does it fit

312
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,600
into the overall plan?

313
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,100
How's that going to get us to our vision and finding 50 different ways, not one to explain

314
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,700
that story so that over time it becomes a shared vision and understanding that that

315
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,240
takes time.

316
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,340
There's no.

317
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,539
No one trick that's going to get everyone saying things in the same way, persistence,

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,379
varied messages, varied mediums of trying to get that message across and just doing

319
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,460
it over and over again.

320
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,940
So it's almost boring.

321
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:44,919
Everyone's like, yeah, we get it.

322
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,679
And then that's probably the point when you're like, okay, it feels like if everyone's saying

323
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,639
this is boring, then we're probably all of a sudden seeing the same thing and we can

324
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,179
talk about it in the same way and we can see the pathway that we're going to get there.

325
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:09,329
Harry Kuehl is recognized as Australia's greatest ever footballer.

326
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:14,950
He's currently the first team manager with the famous Celtic Football Club in Scotland.

327
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,329
Oh, easy.

328
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,630
I mean, I, I love creating.

329
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:20,950
I'm a creative person.

330
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,150
I was a creative player.

331
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,670
And that's the one thing as me being a manager, I've, you know, I've always written

332
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,250
everything like I always wrote everything down, but I never really like had a plan.

333
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,109
I mean, the one thing that always amazes me is when I used to go, go for jobs and people

334
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,190
go, well, how do you play?

335
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,750
How do you, you know, how do you do this?

336
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,069
How do you, well, I don't know what team have I got?

337
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:44,609
What players have I got?

338
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,349
And that was one thing that people say, no, you must have a certain style.

339
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,970
Well, of course I have a certain style of how I want to play, but if I don't have them

340
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,809
players, right, then how am I supposed to be able to play that I want to play?

341
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,490
You know, you, you got to be able to be adaptive, especially at the start.

342
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,390
So that was me as a coach.

343
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,769
But then as I've gone into a player, I mean, as an individual coach, I've looked at it

344
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,170
in completely different ways where I'm looking at.

345
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,150
I'm looking at movement patterns.

346
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,690
I'm looking at body language.

347
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,450
I'm looking at shift and defenders, and I'm only going through experience of what I got

348
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,349
taught when I was younger.

349
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,170
And I go back to even when I got taught how to strike a ball or the cross the ball or

350
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:31,170
the volleyball, these things got broken down for me, like where my foot got, how my foot

351
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,410
had to be placed, how my knee had to be bent, how my shoulder had to be pointed.

352
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,170
And I don't know.

353
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,509
I've always remembered it.

354
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,170
I've always remembered it.

355
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,269
And I knew, and I knew how to do it because the one thing I could do in the game was I

356
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,009
was a very good striker of the ball and a very good crosser of the ball.

357
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:52,190
So when you put me in situation, I can tell when my wingers don't cross the ball properly.

358
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,170
I can just hear by the noise of the ball.

359
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,029
You know, I can see by the pattern of how the ball slides across the grass and I'll

360
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,589
just go, no, I'll just go, no, I'll just go.

361
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,829
And then when they hit it perfect, I'll go, do you hear the sound?

362
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,170
And then even now they're listening to the sound of it.

363
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,150
So it's not about me having all this.

364
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,430
Information and not sharing it.

365
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,769
I will share anything with anybody if they're willing to learn, you know, and I think that's

366
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,089
the important thing is that's why I say it's gotta be a two way, uh, two way, um, street.

367
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,890
Cause if it's not, then you're just talking to, to deaf ears and don't get me wrong.

368
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:31,089
I've got one or two players up there that are not interested, you know, they, they will

369
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,950
sit there and you do a drill with them and all that.

370
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,829
And you know, well, if they need anything, they'll come to you, but then you have the

371
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,170
other ones that really want to learn.

372
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,470
And you just put all your energy and effort into them.

373
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,369
Really love listening back to Liz, to Steve Hooker and Harry Kuehl and could see the consistent

374
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:53,029
pattern of storytelling to engage people's heads and their hearts in creating and sharing

375
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:58,190
a vision, understanding that everyone at the table interprets things differently and finding

376
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,930
a way to connect with people consistently was really interesting to hear, focusing on

377
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,410
the people who are willing to learn as well and letting them be the super storytellers

378
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,170
in your ability to share a vision.

379
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,970
