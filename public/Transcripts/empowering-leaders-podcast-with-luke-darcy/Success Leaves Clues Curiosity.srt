1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:13,980
What a brilliant year it was and seeing so many incredible moments unfold when you get the privilege of sitting across from inspiring people, delving into the intricacies of their success.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:28,300
And in 2023, myself and I hope you as the audience felt like you had a front row seat to conversations that reveal how success leaves clues, featuring individuals who've mastered their craft in a whole range of various fields.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:36,659
At Alita, we recognise the consistent dimensions of brilliant leadership and we're continuing our special series as we explore all of them.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,560
The superpower of curiosity we think is a priceless skill and has immense impact.

5
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,240
Every week on The Empowering Leaders, our discussions span across diverse industries.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,719
We love curating conversations from sport, from business, education, social venture and the arts.

7
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,280
And in this episode, we've curated a remarkable group of individuals who embody the true power of leadership.

8
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:08,200
The true essence of curiosity, starting with Ed O'Malley, who I really enjoyed catching up with this year, president and CEO of the Kansas Health Foundation, a unique leader in his own world.

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,500
And Ed draws inspiration from the cult TV series, Ted Lasso.

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:25,439
I don't know if Ted Lasso has taken off in Australia like it has in the States.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,159
Sure has. What a great show.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,159
Oh, it's such a great show. But there's that one episode where he talks about being curious, not judgmental.

13
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,260
And I just thought that was a great line.

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,620
And it describes to me so much about leadership, to be curious, not judgmental.

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:55,640
And one of the problems, I think, with our current world is because we're so polarised, most people in one faction have a lot of judgments about people in the other faction.

16
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:04,379
Or if we just want to talk about politics, you know, conservatives have a lot of judgments they make about progressives and vice versa.

17
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:16,139
And I think those who exercise leadership suspend their judgments and don't let themselves get emotionally triggered by those, that rhetoric.

18
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:27,080
And they instead get very curious about why somebody is doing what they're doing and how they might engage with that person to help them maybe do something different.

19
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,280
Curiosity feels like a key ingredient to me for exercising effective leadership.

20
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,990
Dr. Shefali.

21
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,930
She has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Columbia University.

22
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,430
She's a three times New York Times bestselling author.

23
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,830
And her book, The Conscious Parent, has been endorsed by Oprah Winfrey as a parenting revolution.

24
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,229
Yeah, curiosity is the key for learning.

25
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:01,030
But we need to be curious to challenge what we're listening to.

26
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,550
We shouldn't be curious about, say, for example, how to become skinnier, prettier, wealthier.

27
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:07,969
Like, don't be curious.

28
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,090
Don't be curious to fall into what society says.

29
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,050
Be curious to ask why the hell does society say that in the first place?

30
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,550
That's the ultimate curiosity is to disrupt and deconstruct what we've been raised with.

31
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:30,210
What has been the intellectual food and the emotional food that culture and your caregivers have been giving you since you were young?

32
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,110
Can you look at that and deconstruct that and don't take it at face value?

33
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:36,550
Dare to challenge.

34
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,030
Why is this on my plate?

35
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
Why is that on my plate in the first place?

36
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,229
Who said that?

37
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,949
Why is that a rule?

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,270
And that is where you become really brave, right?

39
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,389
If you're curious about how to do more of what culture has told you, that's only being a follower.

40
00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:03,009
Real curiosity is to challenge the systems in place and to look at them for their farce.

41
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,229
And most of them are farcical and lies.

42
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,009
And they're not truly upholding.

43
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:22,310
Of our deepest yearnings as a human being, which is to be authentic, to be connected, to be seen, to be valued, not for our looks, our money, our cars, our achievements.

44
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,430
Our greatest yearning is to be seen for who it is we are.

45
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:32,129
And yet most of us don't allow ourselves or don't allow ourselves to see another for who it is they are.

46
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,709
We keep piling on these belief systems.

47
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,870
So if society says.

48
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:44,290
As we know, we need to be high achieving, have a lot of money, be part of the crowd, be famous.

49
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,509
And if we're curious to do those things, meaning how can I be more famous?

50
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,709
How can I follow society's ways?

51
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,949
How can I be richer?

52
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:56,329
That is not the true maverick curiosity.

53
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,850
That's falling in line and following what culture says.

54
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,110
True curiosity is to say, why the hell are we talking about this in the first place?

55
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,649
Where did this come from?

56
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,990
And to really examine the roots.

57
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,290
Of all the belief systems.

58
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,829
So a lot of my work is challenging cultures, paradigms and dismantling them.

59
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:36,899
Mick Doohan is a five time MotoGP world champion, an Australian Sports Hall of Famer and a serious player in the global aviation world, with his business becoming the world's largest trader of corporate aircraft.

60
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,259
People who have success like you consistently, they're curious all the time.

61
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:41,860
They want to learn.

62
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,100
They want to know what's going on.

63
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,259
And.

64
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,720
And through that, that's how they constantly get better.

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,399
Does that resonate with you?

66
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,879
The idea of constantly trying to find that curiosity and things?

67
00:05:51,439 --> 00:06:08,980
Um, yes, less so now, but, but yeah, without a doubt, trying to keep pushing yourself, uh, when, especially back in the competition days, you keep pushing yourself to try and find, you know, you keep pushing that limit and pushing those, that line a little bit further out.

68
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:13,240
So that, that, that gray area is, is, is very clear.

69
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:34,139
You know, the more you keep pushing yourself that clear, that, uh, that, that, that gray area becomes, and I think that's the same with everything, the more you understand and the more you do, whether we just want to put into aviation when I'm first in there and you're fumbling through things, you know, and you are fumbling through things because you haven't done a lot of it in the first time, but after you've done it a hundred times, it's, you know, it's pretty second nature.

70
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,540
And, and I think that's the same thing as what you're saying, but, uh, but you keep pushing through, keep wanting to understand more and more and more.

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,240
And, and that's just called being an old father.

72
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,540
I guess with the experience, yeah.

73
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:55,160
Coming up, we're going to hear from the inspirational Sandy Brondello, the head coach of the Australian Opals and doing a brilliant job as the head coach of New York Liberty and the WNBL.

74
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,100
And one of Australia's favorite ever people for mine, a man I enjoyed spending some time with this year, the great Dr. Chris Brown.

75
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,920
Found it really interesting to hear from Dr. Shefali, Mick Doon and Ed O'Malley.

76
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,600
Very different backgrounds, diverse worlds they come from, but they all talked about genuine curiosity.

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,680
And that's really important.

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,939
It's just, you know, it's so interesting to see today's leaders.

79
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:23,800
A lot of us have come from a place of curiosity involving challenging societal norms, leaders,

80
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,399
suspending judgment to cultivate a curious mindset.

81
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,759
And that curiosity is required to push yourself beyond your limits.

82
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,360
It's pretty clear the transformative power of curiosity in both personal and professional development.

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,240
And we heard that right across the year on the empowering leader series.

84
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,959
At a leader, we are really passionate about creating a world of collaboration, inspiring connections, and bringing together these diverse leaders from different backgrounds around the globe to share our prisoner's story.

85
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,279
Thank you for joining us today.

86
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm Simon ontario.

87
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
share to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

88
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319

You don't have to be a global head of marketing

92
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,160
for an international company

93
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,560
or a superstar coach to be part of Alita Connect.

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
We would love to book a discovery call,

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,339
and his team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand

99
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,540

and empowering leaders podcast.

101
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,060
We know that getting a good night's sleep

102
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,939
is a pattern that we see in all great leaders.

103
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,879
Temper is a mattress like no other.

104
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:16,939
Check it out today.

105
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,779
The next group of guests all speak to how curiosity

106
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,459
has kept them on the path to a life of great success.

107
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,259
Let's first go to Peggy O'Neill,

108
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,160
the former president of the Richmond Football Club

109
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,839
who couldn't have had greater success in her role.

110
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm someone who loved being a student

111
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,080
and it's sort of a, you know,

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,639
get to the point you're not doing formal education

113
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,539
in the same way,

114
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,200
but you're meeting new people that you learn from

115
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,039
if you...

116
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,840
if you let yourself.

117
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,679
And I think that goes back to

118
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,539
understanding a bit more about the kind of person that you are.

119
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,799
And I think that my curiosity about people and places

120
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,919
is really sort of the theme of my life.

121
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,200
And I often think that if I weren't...

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,039
didn't take on some of the jobs that I have now,

123
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:05,379
that I'd love to go work on a PhD in something

124
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,799
because everything is just wonderfully...

125
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm curious about it.

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,980
It's just a...

127
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,480
a wonderful experience to meet someone new,

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
to get the new ideas and whether...

129
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,360
I'm sort of more in the arts kind of thing rather than science,

130
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,440
but I can be fascinated by science too.

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,519
But I just think to meet someone who writes something wonderfully

132
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,639
or a musician who does something that creates beauty in the world

133
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,580
and how little we know,

134
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,299
or how little I know about that whole process

135
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,320
and who these people are.

136
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
And more and more,

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,840
sometimes this information overload is...

138
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,720
How many people are doing things out there

139
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,340
that would be exciting if we knew more about it?

140
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,360
And so every day I learn something new from someone or about someone.

141
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,820
So I think that that means you're never stale.

142
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,720
That means you never feel like you've arrived

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,500
and that you can continue to be excited about new experiences.

144
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,259
Sandy Brondello is Australian basketball royalty,

145
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,960
representing Australia at four Summer Olympics,

146
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,980
and playing over 300 games for her country.

147
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Her extraordinary post-retirement coaching career

148
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,980
sees her as the current head coach of the New York Liberty

149
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,980
and the Australian national team, the Opals.

150
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,980
You know, I've spoken about this has been my passion since the age of nine.

151
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,980
You know, obviously starting to play basketball, learn basketball,

152
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,980
seeing where basketball has taken me, going to the Olympic Games.

153
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
I mean, who would have dreamt I went to one Olympic Games?

154
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Not everyone gets to do that. I went to four.

155
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,980
You know, it's just...

156
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
It's blown away.

157
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
I love the competitiveness of everything.

158
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
But I think you have to...

159
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Like I said, the curiosity is more is continue to learn.

160
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
I always wanted to be the best player I could be,

161
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,980
not be better than my teammate or someone else,

162
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,980
but trying to learn from others how they do things, you know,

163
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,980
asking questions, finding mentors.

164
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,980
I think that's critical for anyone's development at any level.

165
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
You know, I think mentors, they can help you along the way

166
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,980
because it's not just a physical thing that we do with basketball.

167
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
You know, there's the mentors.

168
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
There's the mental part, the emotional part,

169
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,980
the physiological stuff that we all have to learn

170
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
to be the very best that we can be.

171
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,980
And, you know, I've got to know a lot of different people

172
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,980
and the curiosity part comes from just digging,

173
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
asking them questions.

174
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
How?

175
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,980
And that's why I love the letter because it's fantastic

176
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
just because we had so many different leaders

177
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,980
that you could just, you know, connect with.

178
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,980
And I've had Zooms, you know, I love just reaching out to them

179
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,980
and just digging deeper in how they do things.

180
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,980
And regardless if it was in the NFL, the NRL, the AFL, just coaches.

181
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,980
And I love that we wanted to share and help each other, you know,

182
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
because we can all learn from each other.

183
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,980
And business world too, I mean, because leadership is not just in sports.

184
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,980
I mean, you see leaderships because it's all about developing a culture

185
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,980
where you can actually grow the most.

186
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
And I'm massive on that.

187
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
It's not just what you do in practice.

188
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm really big on let's build the right culture.

189
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
What kind of team do we want to be?

190
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
And how are we going to get there?

191
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:21,230
Dr Chris Brown is one of Australia's most popular and respected people.

192
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,230
A vet, a television presenter and an author,

193
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,230
he's an inspiring modern leader and making a huge impact

194
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,230
in the world of animal welfare.

195
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:39,230
I can be my harshest critic often, which I think is a useful skill

196
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,230
but also one that you need to keep an eye on

197
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,230
because you're probably doing okay,

198
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,230
but your inner critic can sometimes have the loudest voice in the room.

199
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,230
And I think that's something to be always to be mindful of.

200
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:01,230
Look, I once got told by a television executive that I'm a difficult dog

201
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,230
to keep on the porch.

202
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,230
And I appreciated the animal sort of link to the analogy.

203
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,230
But what he was trying to say was probably something that is quite relevant.

204
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,230
I get bored easily.

205
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,230
And I'm always looking for a new challenge.

206
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:22,230
And it's kind of that situation where curiosity is a really useful thing to have

207
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,230
and it's sort of guided me through a lot of what I've done

208
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,230
because I want to learn more and I want to be better.

209
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,230
But it can mean that I never like to be stuck in one thing for too long

210
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,230
and always want to be moving on and trying something else.

211
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,230
So that's potentially a bit of a challenge.

212
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,230
I do find it hard to stay in one place for too long,

213
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,230
which probably has flow-on effects to relationships.

214
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,230
I probably would have thought that I'd probably have kids

215
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,230
and potentially be married by now.

216
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,230
But that hasn't happened because I probably prioritised work a little bit,

217
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,230
potentially in hindsight, a little bit too much.

218
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,230
But that sort of thing's there.

219
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,230
It just barks quite loudly, you know, to use another animal analogy.

220
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,230
It can be quite a demanding thing to focus on work.

221
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,230
So, you know, there are probably any regrets I have.

222
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:30,230
It's probably around not necessarily having enough time for myself

223
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,230
and for the people around me.

224
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,230
Funnily enough, in Iceland, I had this really profound moment.

225
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,230
I was hiking in the highlands.

226
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,230
I was in the highlands of Iceland.

227
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,230
And deliberately, I was there by myself and I just was hiking

228
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,230
and just going up and down these little, these volcanoes, basically.

229
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,230
And I was just sort of pondering, pondering life.

230
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,230
And it's a great place to do that because the natural beauty

231
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,230
of things there is just off the charts.

232
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,230
And it just kind of is a really interesting reminder,

233
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,230
the fact that when you are driven and when you're determined

234
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,230
to always strive to be better and curiosity leads you

235
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,230
on those paths and you invest in the, you know, creating a show

236
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,230
or working on a production and, you know, it's such a privilege

237
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,230
to be the front and centre of those productions.

238
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,230
Something like I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here has 400 crew

239
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,230
and you have the honour of standing in front of the camera

240
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,230
essentially presenting the work of 400 people.

241
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,230
It's a reminder that you sometimes get obsessed with it.

242
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,230
You're obsessed with the climb and the climb up that mountain.

243
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,230
And taking on a show and working on a show is like climbing a mountain.

244
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,230
You gather all your reserves at a base camp, if you like.

245
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,230
You fuel yourself up.

246
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,230
You get yourself whole.

247
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,230
You feel like you're ready to take on a challenge.

248
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,230
You store up all that adrenaline.

249
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,230
You're ready to go.

250
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,230
And you start the climb.

251
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,230
And creating a show is a lot like that.

252
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,230
And you take the hits.

253
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,230
It's hard at different times.

254
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,230
But you want to get to the peak of that mountain,

255
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,230
which is essentially your rating success.

256
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,230
It's a show that's well received.

257
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,230
Your performance is something that is well regarded.

258
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,230
And you reach those heights.

259
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,230
And you come off air in that final episode of the series.

260
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,230
And you're like, done.

261
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,230
What a great high.

262
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,230
And then you kind of look around from the top of that mountain

263
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,230
and realise there's about 50 or 60 other mountains out in the distance

264
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,230
that are also there.

265
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,230
As high, if not higher, than the one you're on.

266
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,230
So you think, okay, I'll go back down this mountain

267
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,230
and go back to my base camp.

268
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,230
And then you sort of refuel again.

269
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,230
And you realise that in life everyone's climbing mountains,

270
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,230
you know, in their different fields.

271
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,230
But it's kind of the climb's not important.

272
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,230
The view from the top's not important.

273
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,230
It's kind of like it's basically what happens in the base camp

274
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,230
is kind of the most important part of life.

275
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,230
And I think that's probably I probably neglect my base camp,

276
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,230
a little bit too much.

277
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,230
And the nurturing sort of refuelling, fulfilling aspects of that,

278
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,230
I think are probably something that, you know,

279
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,230
I probably would look to spend more time working on.

280
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,230
And I know I'm not alone in that respect in terms of being able to switch off

281
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,230
and I guess re-engage with the world around you that's not as adrenaline-filled

282
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,230
or cortisol-fuelled as that world.

283
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,230
And I'm sure sports people who get themselves up for a season,

284
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,230
that's their mountain they're climbing.

285
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,230
It's fairly relevant across a lot of people.

286
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,230
And so that's kind of been a really interesting lesson for me.

287
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,230
And something we talk about in the Elite Collective group a lot is just that

288
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,230
how do we switch off and how do we refuel and how do we reconnect?

289
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,230
And I think that's been a really,

290
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,230
really interesting one to see how shared that challenge is of switching off

291
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,230
and of recharging.

292
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:21,230
That's probably the biggest one that I think is an ongoing challenge

293
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,230
for so many of us.

294
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,480
Once again, I really enjoyed going back to listen to Peggy O'Neill,

295
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,480
to Sandy Brondello, Dr Chris Brown and their reflections

296
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
and the patterns that emerged.

297
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
The constant pursuit of new challenges was a common theme.

298
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
All continuous lifelong learners.

299
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
I've heard that so much in 2020 through,

300
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
that constant and never-ending self-improvement desire to keep learning

301
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,480
regardless of what stage or age of your life and career you're at.

302
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
And learning from diverse teachers and mentors from different backgrounds.

303
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
The idea that learning does show up in different forms

304
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,480
was something that I certainly enjoyed hearing a lot more about.

305
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,480
A huge thanks to all of our guests featured on this episode.

306
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,480
You can find the links to the full-length in-depth conversations

307
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
that I had with each of them in the show notes.

308
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I encourage you to go back and listen to those episodes.

309
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
In our next Success Leaves Clues episode,

310
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,480
we'll shift focus to the leadership dimension

311
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
of communicating with clarity.

312
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
You can hear from some extraordinary guests

313
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
about the pivotal role communication has played

314
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
in each of their unique journeys.

315
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,480
