1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,070
I've been fortunate enough to work in media and broadcast and calling sport for more than

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,470
15 years now, but recording the Empowering Leaders series is the most enjoyable thing

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,109
I've ever done.

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:19,850
And it's incredible to sit down across from so many inspiring people, as we did in 2023

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,730
for this podcast, talking about all the ways that success leaves clues with people at the

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,510
top of their game and in their chosen field.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,850
At Alita, we know that there are consistent dimensions of what brilliant leadership looks

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,090
like, and we're covering them all in this special series.

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,189
We know that having great leaders in your own life can shape your path and inspire you

10
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,530
to reach greater heights.

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,450
And every week on the Empowering Leaders, our conversations stretch across different

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:45,810
fields.

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,310
We're really passionate about curating people from different backgrounds, sport, business,

14
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,250
education, social venture, and the arts.

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,810
You would have heard me talk about that a lot across the year.

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,509
And in this episode, we've handpicked a remarkable group of individuals with heartfelt stories

17
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:01,829
about the great life.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,590
Leaders who've left an indelible mark on their lives.

19
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:08,370
One of my favorite things to do is to ask people who has been the greatest leader in

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,849
their life.

21
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,829
And I want to start with Bob Murphy, one of my great friends in life, former captain of

22
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,829
the Western Bulldogs AFL team, and a very unique thinker in every way.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Luke Beveridge.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,739
Luke Beveridge has been the greatest leader in my life.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,840
I like leaders for lots.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,900
I mean, there's, yeah, again, there's so...

27
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:43,120
Leadership's so big and so broad, but I love people who can stop momentum of atmosphere

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,579
to go, hey, wait, what just happened then?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,579
So there was a moment early on in his coaching time when we didn't really know who he was

30
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,879
or what was...

31
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:04,439
And someone announced that, oh, Marcus Bontempelli, who's probably a close second, Marcus is

32
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,560
putting himself to be a part of a charity about violence against women.

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,620
And it's, oh, that's great.

34
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,939
Yeah, I mean, 19-year-old kid.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,319
And it was a sort of, it was a bit of a footnote to the meeting in Borussia, and Luke stopped

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,039
and said, hey, hey, hey, everyone, sit back down.

37
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:30,840
This is a young kid who's in our program who's going to put himself out there for a cause

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,080
that he really means it.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
And it's about...

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,039
It's about protecting women and helping society, and that's important.

41
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:48,340
And I just remember sitting there going, we are a different football club as of that moment.

42
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,120
Little things are big things.

43
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,639
You know, I just, I always remember those sort of, those little touchstones of like,

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,360
that's one aspect of leadership that I hold in a really high regard.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,219
Yeah, and it's such a...

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,800
It's such a unique part of our history, isn't it, Bob?

47
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,819
We go back to both of, you know, where we met and this history and love of football club.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,400
And as you know the history so well, and you mentioned it beautifully that, you know, I

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
was there many times when it looked like you're going to go out of business and it was going

50
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,960
to be over and arrive just after the fight back.

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,580
And that was really fresh in everyone's minds that, you know, it was days away from being

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,879
not a club anymore.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,199
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,080
And then you see this sort of...

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,460
This sort of paradigm shift that happened when, you know, in your combination with Luke

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,020
and the whole environment, but the point of difference was Luke Beveridge at that time

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,719
and you being a captain.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
It's, you know, when you look back, it's provided some sustainable success.

59
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,460
Yeah, it's just a magical time, you know, like one of the hard things about football

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,580
at the elite level is everyone's trying.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,159
Yeah.

62
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,159
Like they're ready.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,860
They're headlining it.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,639
They're trying so hard and they care and they're emotionally invested.

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,540
But if there's not an emotional alignment, particularly with the leaders, it's hard

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,319
because there's a lot of effort and there's a lot of strain.

67
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,399
But if it's not going in the same way, there's a lot of conflict.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,399
And just for that brief period at the Bulldogs during that time, it was like a...

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,220
It was like an orchestra, like a symphony, and it just clicked and we made some music.

70
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:46,319
Anita Jacoby is one of the most respected and decorated producers in Australian television history.

71
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,000
For more than 40 years, she led the way in her industry on shows including 60 Minutes,

72
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,220
Enough Rope and Grew and Transfer.

73
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,259
She's currently the chair of the ABC's Advisory Council.

74
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,740
Probably a man called Kevin Weldon.

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,139
Kevin Weldon, to your audience,

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,779
if they don't know of him, he formed and founded a company called Paul Hamlin's here

77
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,240
in Australia.

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,300
It was one of the largest book publishing companies in Australia, extremely successful.

79
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,139
And I worked with Hamlin's when I first came out of school.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
And Kevin was an incredibly entrepreneurial man.

81
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,079
So I was about 18 and I started there and we were given mini minors and we were dressed

82
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,600
up in outfits and sent out to sell books because he was such an entrepreneurial character.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,879
But what he taught me really was to always not to be afraid of risks at all.

84
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,360
At 18, he gave us all an assignment.

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,500
There were eight of us, eight marketing trainees that he brought on straight out of school.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,399
And the assignment was that we had to go and ring somebody important and set up an interview

87
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,540
and go and interview them.

88
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,600
Now, you can imagine at 18, I was pretty intimidated by that, even having had a very strong father.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,220
I was given Sir Robert Norman, who was then the CEO of the Bank of New South Wales, which

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
is now the Westpac.

91
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,660
And I went home and I did all my research and I spent an hour with Sir Robert Norman

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,040
talking about the economy.

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,100
I knew nothing about the economy, I've got to say.

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,180
I just sat there and actually spent an hour talking to him.

95
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,120
What it taught me was that anybody's accessible.

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,540
And Kevin Weldon gave me these great skills to recognise resilience, courage, entrepreneurial,

97
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,759
being entrepreneurial.

98
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,980
He was just a terrific boss to have.

99
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,540
At a young age in my life, and he informed a lot of my thinking about the way to approach

100
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,819
business and be a leader.

101
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,220
Meggie Palmer is a Walkley Award winning filmmaker and a former foreign correspondent and journalist

102
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,720
for BBC World, CNBC and Dateline.

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,879
After her own personal experience of discrimination and inequality, Meggie founded Pep Talker.

104
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,939
She now works to close the gender pay gap with her thriving global business and community

105
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:02,660
of more than 60,000 professionals.

106
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,259
That's such a great question.

107
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,699
I mean, I think there's sort of like, there's definitely family members, you know, my family,

108
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,240
my siblings inspire me, obviously my parents, my grandparents, even my grandparents who

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,540
I lost really early, you know, who I hardly even remember, but just like the lessons that

110
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,540
stay with my mum, my aunts and uncles, you know, my mum lost her parents quite young.

111
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,480
And so, but those lessons and those values really are instilled in me and my cousins

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,620
and all of our gatherings.

113
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,579
And then the same on my dad's side, like family is so important and I'm so grateful to have

114
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,180
that connection with my cousins.

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,939
But then I also reflect like on a business sense, like early in my career, I had this

116
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,800
great news director, Kathy Schnitzeling.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,420
I started my career at Channel 10 in Brisbane and she was the news director there.

118
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,899
And she was like, awesome.

119
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,620
She kind of modelled vulnerability and authenticity before it was cool.

120
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,259
Like she was very like hard on the table, like this is the situation, highs and lows

121
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,259
of her life.

122
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,259
And now I reflect on that.

123
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:01,899
I was like, she was kind of like living what Brené Brown was like.

124
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,899
Yeah.

125
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,399
Yeah.

126
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,959
She's got some practices now, but she was doing it all those years ago.

127
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,040
And even when it comes to pay, she modelled for me, Luke, really early.

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,480
I was kind of there for a year or two and I was getting a bit bored and I was kind of

129
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
like, maybe I should get another job.

130
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I don't really know.

131
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,980
And I didn't talk to her about it or anyone about it.

132
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,420
I just started like Googling what should I do next?

133
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,339
And then she called me into her office and she was like, so you've been here a year,

134
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,079
a year and a half.

135
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,779
You should really ask me for a pay raise.

136
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,779
And I was like, what?

137
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,639
And she was like, wink, wink.

138
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,639
Like.

139
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,620
So.

140
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,779
I was like, I'm going to ask for better money.

141
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,200
Possibly I could do something about that.

142
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,740
And I was like, oh, so she was kind of like leading a horse to water.

143
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
And I was like, could I please have a pay raise?

144
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,799
And she was like, yes, yes, you can.

145
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,519
So she kind of coached me, you know, from a really young age that it's OK to ask that

146
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,559
there was money available.

147
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,059
And I actually wonder what would have happened to my salary if she hadn't taught me that

148
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,639
early on, because we know that, you know, if you don't negotiate your first salary,

149
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,960
which by the way, I did not when I took the job while I was still at university, I just

150
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,299
took what they offered, which I think was like twenty eight grand or something.

151
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,000
And I thought I was so rich.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,299
If you don't negotiate like I didn't because of compounding interest and superannuation

153
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,279
and all that kind of stuff, you're going to retire with half a million dollars less than

154
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,620
someone else who did negotiate in their first job.

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,500
And so, again, I just try to pay that forward to anyone who will listen.

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,539
Like, please tell your daughters, your cousins, your mentees, anyone who will listen, like,

157
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,179
please negotiate your first salary.

158
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,679
They might say no.

159
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,679
But if they say yes.

160
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,960
It's going to make a huge difference over the course of your career.

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,759
Coming up, you're going to hear from Richard Burnett, the global CEO of Body Fit Training,

162
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,279
Donna Urquhart, ultra marathon runner extraordinaire, and Danny Green, the four time world champion

163
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,700
boxer who has a unique way of thinking, a really remarkable guy.

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,519
Bob Murphy, Anita Jacobi, Maggie Palmer all just talk beautifully for me about leaders

165
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,159
who pause and acknowledge significant moments.

166
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,159
The power of authenticity.

167
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,460
And openness in our leaders and the lifelong lessons learned when someone throws you a

168
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,139
bit out of your comfort zone.

169
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,419
Loved hearing from all of those remarkable people and leader.

170
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,500

Next group of guests all have brilliant stories about the greatest leader in their lives and

183
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,159
how they were instrumental to the life that they've gone on to live.

184
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,159
Let's go first to Richard Burnett, the global CEO of Body Fit Training.

185
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,159
Richard, welcome to the show.

186
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,159
Thanks for having me.

187
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,159
Thanks for having me.

188
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,159
Thanks for having me.

189
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,159
Thanks for having me.

190
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,159
Thanks for having me.

191
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,159
Thanks for having me.

192
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,159
Thanks for having me.

193
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,159
Thanks for having me.

194
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,159
Thanks for having me.

195
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,320
These guests all have brilliant stories about the greatest leader in their lives and how

196
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,879
they were instrumental to the life that they've gone on to live.

197
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,980
Let's go first to Richard Burnett, the global CEO and director of Body Fit Training with

198
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,620
over 600 franchises sold across the world and a personal path that's had more than its

199
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,620
fair share of hurdles and life challenges.

200
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,360
Different people for different circumstances to ask I think, but if I think back to my

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,080
time, I had a couple of...

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:29,679
unbelievable managers at BP and John Clark and Lance Ed who gave me the confidence that I was

203
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:38,639
just a young buck as a BP graduate trainee. But they only choose five a year out of uni

204
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,279
and I was one of those. And these particular managers gave me the responsibility at a very

205
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:51,059
young age to be a regional franchise manager looking after 30 or 40 BPs in Melbourne.

206
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,019
And that's where your franchise came from, out of that.

207
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,340
Yeah, exactly. Out of that, randomly. Yeah, because BP, a lot of the service stations

208
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,659
are franchised. And then Lance and John both backed me in to go and run a company owned

209
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:10,220
and operated 12 site, multi-site franchise in North Queensland, in Townsville and in

210
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Cairns. So I was there as a 25 or so.

211
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,080
Or seven year old, maybe, yeah, 25 or seven, one of those ages, looking after 110 staff,

212
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:27,799
living remotely by myself up there to deliver bottom line, you know, millions of dollars

213
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:34,659
for BP. So they backed me in and believed in me. And for me, they've been incredibly

214
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:39,279
influential and I don't thank them or see them enough for that. And then you-

215
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,779
Can I just start on that? I mean, for a size, a company size of BP, that seems incredibly

216
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,259
flexible.

217
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,019
To be able to trust a 25 year old, put them into, with all the bureaucracy of a hundred

218
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,659
thousand people globally, that seems pretty unique that they're able to just go, yeah,

219
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:57,000
we see something in you, go and go for it.

220
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,860
Yeah. I think I mentioned it a little bit, but I loved that people development aspect

221
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,039
to BP. And that's one of the things that they were incredibly strong with. I was there for

222
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,840
six months as a 21 year old and I got the tap from my manager and he said, we need you

223
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,799
to go to Papua New Guinea.

224
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,299
And to evaluate our distributorships in PNG. So I lived in PNG for six months as a 21 year

225
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,639
old because I was part of this graduate trainee scheme where they want to expose you and throw

226
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,419
you in the deep end all over the world to really test your ability to cope under pressure

227
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,440
and to deliver. And that's what they, you know, that's why they invest in you obviously

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,139
as a graduate trainee. But you're right. It was, they were some incredibly influential

229
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,259
and defining moments of my life being in PNG and then moving.

230
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,879
And then moving to Townsville and running the show up there.

231
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,580
Donna Urquhart is a physiotherapist and pain scientist, a Polar ultra marathon record

232
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,779
in December, 2023. Running 1300 kilometers over 30 days in Antarctica, her mission is

233
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:08,240
to raise one and a half million dollars to support the next generation of young females

234
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
in sport.

235
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,580
My mum, she has been the greatest role model. And I've only just realised, you know, I've

236
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,080
only just realised that I can do this for the next generation of young females in sport.

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,179
My mum, she has been the greatest role model. And I've only just realised, you know, I've

238
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:20,600
that recently, Luke. Just over the last sort of five to 10 years, having more conversations with

239
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,860
her, now being a mum, I've learnt just what she has taught me. I think when you're younger,

240
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:36,399
you don't necessarily realise that, you know, what you learn from your parents and how that

241
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:44,139
sort of washes over you. But just stories she's told me, I've really thought, yes, that part of

242
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:51,919
me that is prepared to step out and have a go and that curiosity to be on that cutting edge and find

243
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,700
out new information that has really come from her. Because she tells me about how she had my brother

244
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,539
and I, and she was in her 30s. She hadn't particularly had the support to do well at school.

245
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,820
And, you know, you can imagine back in that day for a mother with two young children to then go to

246
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,740
university, do a psychology degree and become a psychology teacher. It was quite a unique step

247
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,759
for her. And I know she's talked about people around her, her neighbours, her friends, really

248
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,240
raising eyebrows about that. And it wasn't the thing to do as a mother back then. So I think

249
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,379
that's just one example of the example she's given me.

250
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,700
Set that I've then, that's washed over me and helped me then step forward into areas that are

251
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,279
quite unique, like running in Antarctica, 1300 kilometres. I think that's given me the courage

252
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:57,179
to do that. And she has been incredibly supportive all the way through. She has had concerns.

253
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:04,379
We have talked about it. She actually did say to me at one point very early on when she didn't know

254
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,379
really the intricacies of what I was doing.

255
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:14,659
She did say to me, do you know, Donna, if something's to happen to you, that could have

256
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:24,360
quite a significant impact on your husband and your son. And I think the word destroy was in

257
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,019
there mixed in. I can't remember the exact words, but yeah, she was quite concerned to begin with.

258
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:36,379
And as her daughter, I didn't quite understand that. Like I found that,

259
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,080
really hard. I was like, where's that full support? I knew it was coming from a

260
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,799
place of love and concern. But now as a mother, I know exactly where that comes from. Because if my

261
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:55,940
son told me he was doing that, it would be a different story. But in fact, I have spoken to

262
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,360
my team about that and they've explained how pivotal that comment has been for them, how that's

263
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,359
really driven them to tick off all the risks.

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,079
And be really honed in on the incredible dangers that we can face when we're in Antarctica.

265
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,400
Danny Green is the only Australian boxer to win four world titles across three

266
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,960
different weight divisions. And he's represented his country at both the Commonwealth and Olympic

267
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Games. Since self-funding his anti-violence movement, the Cowards Punch campaign,

268
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,160
his efforts have formed a legacy that may well outweigh all of his achievements in the boxing room.

269
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,140
My father. Yeah, my father, Malcolm, without doubt. No, he was my footy coach when we were

270
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,500
young from the age of nine to I was 17. We won three premierships, 14s, 15s and 17s and only

271
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,859
junior footy. And I was the smallest guy. The only place she could hide me was on the floor pocket.

272
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,160
And occasionally I'd get a crumb every now and then. And yeah, but we were not one of us in our

273
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,920
team. We played against guys at, you know, 17s grand final, Daniel Sirikowski, David Sirikowski

274
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,519
Southern. And then Mark Miranda as well, I think, played in the team we played against in the

275
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,500
grand final. So, you know, really good footballers. But in our team, not one person played reserves

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,319
footy. A couple of guys played a few games of Colts. We were ordinary players, but we were a

277
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,660
fantastic unit. So, for instance, this will make you smile. My old man was, he loved his footy. He

278
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,859
was a good footballer in the bush when he played. And then he loved coaching and he was a really,

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,279
really good, he knew how to get the best out of young blokes. And he was a dad who, he was a

280
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,059
pick up and drop off boys who couldn't make it to training or his old man wasn't present in their

281
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,980
life. And they all keep in touch with me to this day saying, your old man was just so good to me,

282
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,599
granny. You don't realise how much of an impact you had on my young life. And so that makes me

283
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:56,839
very proud. But on the way to our grand final, the 17s grand final, we played at Claremont Oval

284
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,559
and they were already on the ground. So we'd organised to meet at our home ground where we

285
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,960
played. We all go there, we all go in our gear, we all train and warm up there before.

286
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,740
We all get in a bus and we drive to the venue on the bus. When the bus got there, it got there like

287
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,319
five minutes before the game started. We ran straight off the bus onto the Oval, did a few

288
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,680
laps, a few warmups, bang. Soren went and we kicked the first goal and hit the ground running.

289
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:24,920
So his idea was let's rattle them. Let's rattle them. No one knew where we were. They thought

290
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,160
we'd gone down the ground because there was not one person from our team at the Oval and there

291
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,809
was five of us in both. Once again, I have really enjoyed going back to listen to Rich Burnett from

292
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:44,130
and her incredible mission to break the Guinness World Record in Antarctica for an ultramarathon and

293
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,930
the great Danny Green, one of the great sportsmen in Australian sporting history. And even though

294
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,509
they're unique and different backgrounds, you can see the patterns, all of them talking about having

295
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:59,230
someone trust and believe in your abilities to take on significant responsibility, the courage

296
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,329
and resilience to defy cultural norms and stand up for what you believe in. Along with kindness

297
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,849
and empathy and generosity of time, you see that pattern emerge.

298
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:14,349
A lot in the conversations I had across the year in 2023. Huge thank you to all of the guests that

299
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:20,130
featured on this episode. You can find the links to the full length in-depth conversations I had

300
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,329
with each of them in the show notes. Love you to go back and listen to some of those episodes.

301
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:30,430
In our next and final Success Leaves Clues episode, we'll hear about the power of collaboration,

302
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:36,049
something that we are really passionate about at Alita and the dream collaborations for a

303
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,849
carefully selected group from our 2020 season.
