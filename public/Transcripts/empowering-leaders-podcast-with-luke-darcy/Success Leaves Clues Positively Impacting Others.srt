1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,009
What a great privilege it has been to spend another year sitting across from inspiring

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,470
leaders at the top of their game as they share and unpack the learnings and life lessons

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,169
from their chosen field.

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,750
At Alita, we know that there are consistent dimensions of what great leadership looks

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,190
like, and we're uncovering them all in this special series.

6
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:28,670
In our work, we see so many people in positions of leadership who are really conscious of

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,270
how they positively impact others in their environment on a daily basis.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,549
And each week on the Empowering Leaders podcast, we hear from people across all industries,

9
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:42,429
whether it be from sport or business, education, social venture, and the arts.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,350
And when it comes to this dimension of positively impacting others, we had a pretty difficult

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,810
time, it's fair to say, in narrowing down a select group of people that we wanted to

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,090
share with you in this episode today.

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,590
Starting with Craig McRae, who had an incredibly positive impact as the coach of the Collingwood

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,229
Football Club, winning the premiership in 2023.

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,170
And in lots of ways for me, reshaping the way we see senior coaches go about their role

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,730
with great empathy and great effect.

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,829
I think that's a natural course of my own energy.

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,969
I don't find it that difficult to see the glass fall, or close to it, see the good in

19
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:20,269
people.

20
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,230
So I think that's important.

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,469
And obviously with tiredness and being pulled, your focus gets pulled in all sorts of directions

22
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,730
through performance and the role.

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,209
But coming back to what you're good at.

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,930
And, you know, I remember we lost three games in a row that time when I had to go to that

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,870
board meeting, and it was only my first year as a coach.

26
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,109
And there's a lot of different pressures that come with that that you haven't experienced

27
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,450
before, and I don't know what will come again.

28
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,390
You know, I was sitting in a coma for two days in my bed going, how do I get out of

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,609
this?

30
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,629
You know, like, what do we do?

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,609
And, you know, playing a Friday night and finally getting myself into an energy level

32
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,670
just to communicate with my wife, little anyone else.

33
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,609
And she goes, you know how to do this.

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,849
You know how to get out of this.

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,290
I said, what?

36
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,629
She goes, just be you.

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,269
It's a positive version of you.

38
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,769
So instead of looking at all the things we didn't do in that game over the last two weeks,

39
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:11,169
I scrapped it and just said to the coaches that day, I said, boys, don't come tomorrow

40
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,270
and show us what we didn't do.

41
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,210
I'm not interested.

42
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,229
Find evidence of all the things that we have done and what we're going to do next.

43
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,810
Like, let's concentrate on the team we want to be, not the team we are right now.

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,490
So, and funnily enough, it was a great reset of, like, we might have tried to go too fast,

45
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,250
too quick with the group.

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,210
When you go, no, they got that.

47
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,650
They got that.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,289
Let's go to this.

49
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:30,650
Yeah.

50
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,110
So we just.

51
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,169
Went back in time a little bit and said, boys, if we're going to be this great pressure

52
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:35,909
team, we're going to do this.

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,270
Yeah.

54
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,569
So funnily enough, we won the next 10 games in a row, I think, from that.

55
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,250
But it was a moment that the group was potentially waiting for, you know, that heavy stick.

56
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,030
And not to say that you can't give a heavy stick, but at that time, they probably got

57
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,030
what they least expected.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,229
And it was a moment to go, all right, no, we need to be this team.

59
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's go be this team.

60
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,509
So the 80-20 rule, if you like, of positivity or reward behavior.

61
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,389
And then the 20% of, like, hey, let's get better in this area.

62
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,199
Sarah Grinberg was the executive producer of Australia's most iconic radio duo, Hamish

63
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,719
and Andy.

64
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,400
Now she's the host of her own chart-topping podcast, A Life of Greatness.

65
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:29,099
Well, you know, especially with the people that, you know, are in my team, I, you know,

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,659
again, I think I got this from Hamish and Andy and it's so basic.

67
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,659
But when they're doing good work, I tell them that they're doing good work.

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,699
I tell them that I appreciate them.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,780
I don't do the opposite thinking like, oh, if I appreciate them too much, then maybe

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,599
they'll, you know, I don't know.

71
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,719
You can't over-appreciate, can you?

72
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,159
Exactly.

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Exactly.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,719
You know, it's little things like that.

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,719
Again, something I learned from the boys, like actually at Christmas time, buying them

76
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,360
something nice.

77
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,539
It's their birthday, celebrating their birthday.

78
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,099
These are all such little things, but they all make such a big difference.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,439
Being an ear for them if they need to talk.

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,060
I mean, there was.

81
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,139
There was someone that works for me that was really having a hard time the other day

82
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,419
and called me and we just chatted about their personal life and I gave them any help that

83
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,379
I could and any resources that I thought would help them along the way.

84
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,399
Like, you have to lead with compassion and you have to be real when you lead too.

85
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:29,980
Like, you don't want to be a bumbling mess, obviously, but at the same time, I think when

86
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,360
you're a leader and you do show that you're a human and you have emotions, that is a big

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,019
thing too.

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,519
Because it allows them to realize that they too can show that.

89
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,560
And I remember years ago I interviewed Simon Sinek and he was very, he's obviously a leadership

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,800
expert and he was saying like during COVID, he's not going to pretend that he's not suffering

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,759
to his team.

92
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,480
He was suffering and people would reach out to ask him if he was okay the same way that

93
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,420
he would do the same.

94
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,100
So I think it's that whole idea of realizing that you're all human, you're not robots and

95
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,040
that you need to.

96
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,379
Treat people in a respectful manner and be compassionate and know that sometimes they

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,199
are doing long hours and maybe that means that they don't work the next day or they

98
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,860
start later.

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,720
It's just little things like that so they don't feel like they're a number rather than

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,319
a person.

101
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,850
Jules Lund is a celebrated television and radio host and one of the most passionate

102
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,930
and positive people you'll ever meet.

103
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:39,269
He's also the founder of Tribe, a global marketplace for social influencers and the brands that

104
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:39,769
need them.

105
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,850
How do I positively impact?

106
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,410
Well, I genuinely believe that people should have a big swing.

107
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:52,889
You know, I get super excited by speaking to people who are a bit hungry.

108
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:59,310
Like that to me is, that to me is something I'm super passionate about, which is that

109
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,569
sort of 18 to 22 year old where you're out of school and you're trying to look at the

110
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,550
big wide world.

111
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,889
For me, I love that.

112
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:14,189
That innate coaching, you know, when I speak to them and I'm like, what are you going to

113
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:14,350
do?

114
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,069
You're going to travel overseas or I do, you know, like I just love that coaching.

115
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:23,290
And so I think when I speak to friends who are like, you know, what do I do next?

116
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:30,170
I get, I think I positively impact them by, you know, helping them strategize, write up

117
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:37,269
a plan, be clear on their vision to confront limiting beliefs and then start.

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,180
Mark Bunn.

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,439
He's a former professional AFL footballer who moved on to become one of the world's

120
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,980
most sought after experts in Ayurvedic medicine.

121
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,720
His book, Ancient Wisdom for Modern Health is a three times bestseller.

122
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,420
It's ever evolving for me.

123
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,779
One of the things I've really, life certainly isn't perfect.

124
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,439
You know, that bubble of sort of, you know, there's this ancient wisdom that has this

125
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,079
theory on life and it all sounded fantastic.

126
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,459
But, you know, like you, I'm bumbling away.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,459
And trying to live life and not get too stressed and, you know, all that sort of stuff.

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,639
So I find it changes and evolves.

129
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,579
I think one of the best things we've heard over the last five years, and I'm sure you've

130
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,240
interviewed many guests who've touched that whole idea of embracing our imperfections

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,899
and our, you know, being vulnerable.

132
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,839
And that's been a big one for me.

133
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,279
Shame was a massive thing for me as a young sort of boy and adult and sort of putting

134
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,180
on the mask of bravado and fear of failure in footy.

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,339
Not rewards of success, all that stuff.

136
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,220
So for me, it's really been coming back to just self-kindness is probably the best term

137
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,459
for it that, hey, life is tough in many cases.

138
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:59,060
Yes, there's these great wisdoms of life and cultures that have sort of been a lighthouse

139
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,779
for how we live individually and collectively, but it's not easy unless you're in those

140
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,519
cultures 24-7 to do it.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,699
So let's sort of be kind, kind to myself, kind to those around us and just try and embrace

142
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,319
those wisdoms gradually over time.

143
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,279
So that collectively and as a society, we can embrace them.

144
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,240
Because I think that's the real game changer when we do it, do it en masse.

145
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,439
Well, some fascinating insights for me already from Craig McRae, from Sarah, Jules and Mark.

146
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,460
Their success in each of their chosen field, to me, clearly demonstrates what's possible

147
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,399
when intentionally building up the people around us.

148
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,519
I love Mark Bunn's story about the power of getting out of the shame cycle and how it

149
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,220
helps you show up even more for the people around you.

150
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,480
At Alita, we are really passionate about creating a world of collaboration, inspiring

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,539

Big thanks, as always, to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper, Australia and New

161
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
Zealand, for their ongoing support of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

162
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,899
We know that getting a good night's sleep is a pattern that we see in all great leaders.

163
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,840
Temper is a mattress like no other.

164
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,919
Check it out today.

165
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,340
Coming up, we'll hear from Peggy O'Neill, the former president of the Richmond Football

166
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,960
Club, author Dr. Kirsten Ferguson, and the global head of marketing for Budweiser, Richard

167
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,440
Oppy, one of the biggest marketing roles in the world.

168
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,179
Just this last weekend.

169
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,980
I went to be the guest of honor at Annie Smith's restaurant in Trentham, Victoria, to celebrate

170
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,460
Mother's Day.

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,860
And she was having this lunch and said to the room full of people, which was very lovely,

172
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,039
Stephanie is my kitchen mother.

173
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,559
Everything I know, she taught me.

174
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,960
Well, that is absolutely not true, but it was lovely to hear her say that.

175
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,559
And she had asked me to design the menu, which she then cooked.

176
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,980
So that is, she is one of my very, very special foodie friends.

177
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,019
But there are a lot of people who have worked with me and alongside me.

178
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:31,139
And I think I would reiterate that what they've got for me is very positive modeling, because

179
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,639
I really do live what I say.

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,539
You know, I just don't eat fast food because it doesn't seem to me to be as interesting

181
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,399
as the food I can cook myself.

182
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,620
That doesn't mean I don't eat a bit of street food here and there.

183
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,019
But.

184
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,279
I do like sushi, but, you know, I'm not tempted by the packaged product when I can go home

185
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,659
and make something much more beautiful.

186
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,899
I've watched people go on to run their own restaurants and it's over such a long time

187
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:00,220
now.

188
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,220
Often we've lost touch, but when I meet people or I go into a restaurant, there's often somebody

189
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,480
who comes up and says, I worked for you at such and such.

190
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,559
Now that includes, of course, the dishwashers and the front of house stuff.

191
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,240
And I don't always remember.

192
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,700
But they remember the experience as positive and enthusiastic.

193
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,419
So, you know, I stick with it.

194
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,299
Enthusiasm sweeps all before it.

195
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,340
When I'm working with somebody in the kitchen, I can't help sharing with them a bigger picture.

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,259
You know, if we're chopping up leeks, I might say, goodness, I remember having this beautiful

197
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:43,639
pasta dish or this beautiful pastry, which was full of leeks that have been softly stewed

198
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,019
in butter.

199
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,500
For about 15 minutes, then drained and then mixed with such.

200
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,320
And the person who's chopping the leeks just hears that it's a sort of part of it's another

201
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,299
track going through their mind.

202
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:02,700
But if it happens every day and a different product every day, they do get a different

203
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,159
sense of the possibilities of food.

204
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:12,460
And a lot of the people that I influence positively, I'd like to think they were young people full

205
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,139
of enthusiasm.

206
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:13,940
But they often.

207
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,179
Didn't have very strong food backgrounds.

208
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,500
They were interested and they became very competent.

209
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,039
They took on a lot of knowledge and they understood that food was more than just nutrients.

210
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,980
You're not just absorbing calories.

211
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,399
You know, you're eating people's stories.

212
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,700
Peggy O'Neill was the first in her family to go to university, the first female lawyer

213
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,820
at her legal firm.

214
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,080
And she became the first female president of an Australian.

215
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,340
Rules Football Club when she started with Richmond in 2013.

216
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,080
She's currently the chancellor of RMIT University.

217
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:02,539
I think also that constructive criticism is much more helpful, that you want to help people

218
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:06,399
get better at what they do to understand what you're trying to do.

219
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,200
So I think the positivity is helping people find out more about themselves and about their

220
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
capabilities.

221
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,659
It doesn't mean that you.

222
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,779
Stick with things that aren't working, but that you give people a chance and that you feel you've been fair.

223
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:35,700
And I remember early on when I had this partner in a law firm and I had to accept the responsibility of some people aren't going to work out and some people on my team, I'm going to have to have those terrible conversations with.

224
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:45,500
And I thought, if you can put your hand in your heart and say, you know, you've been fair and they're going to be no surprises, because if it's me, I want to know where my shortcomings were.

225
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:45,860
And I thought, if you can put your hand in your heart and say, you know, you've been fair and they're going to be no surprises, because if it's me, I want to know where my shortcomings were.

226
00:13:45,860 --> 00:14:01,440
Along the way, and I was given a chance to fix it, and it could be this job isn't for everybody, but I think that's part of helping people develop and helping them understand that perhaps what they're doing isn't isn't their real strength and they need to look somewhere else.

227
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:10,860
So I think it goes back to being somewhat easy to get along with, not not getting angry at people for something that is usually about you more than about them.

228
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:15,340
I think that we all like to work with people that seem to like us.

229
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,559
Dr. Kirsten Ferguson is one of Australia's most prominent leadership experts.

230
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:35,299
She is an award-winning, globally recognised executive coach, public speaker, company director and writer with a 30-year executive career and a PhD in leadership and culture.

231
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,559
Firstly, our sense of self-awareness is much greater than it actually is.

232
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,360
So that's something to be aware of.

233
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,559
And research shows 95% of us think we're self-aware.

234
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,860
And only 10% to 15% of those that we lead agree.

235
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,840
So that's a pretty scary statistic.

236
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,179
So when you say having a positive impact, I guess my first thought is how do you know it's positive?

237
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:09,980
Because we may have a sense that they love it when I fist pump them every day when I come into the office.

238
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:15,759
There could also be a situation where everyone dreads that they've got to do that every morning.

239
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,419
Because you do.

240
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,799
That is a perfunctory thing.

241
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,679
But then for the rest of the day, you're the dickhead.

242
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:29,879
So there's this whole sense of understanding how you're impacting people, but only through feedback.

243
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:38,620
Like unless you're actually checking how that impact is being measured, I think it's hard for us to judge.

244
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,379
Sorry, that feels like a complicated way to answer your question.

245
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,179
But whenever we say a positive impact, how do you know?

246
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,200
How do you know?

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,120
That's great.

248
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,740
That's a great thought and one that is challenging in some ways, isn't it?

249
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,860
Because you're right.

250
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:00,659
I mean, you think you're self-aware, but if you're not measuring it and asking people and not reflecting constantly, then how do you actually know?

251
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,259
Can I give you an example?

252
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:13,440
During the pandemic at the start when we were all at home, there were a lot of leaders who thought they needed to check in with their teams online like every hour, every day or whatever.

253
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,879
And there were team members just going, can you just back off?

254
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,980
Like, I know you care, but this is now really irritating because I don't need you to check in.

255
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:38,639
So, I mean, that's so simple an example, but it's that idea that we must get feedback and we must create a feedback culture where people feel they can say, mate, the fist pumps, we love the intention, but let's focus on this instead.

256
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,500
Maybe once a week.

257
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,539
Yeah.

258
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,240
Wander back, dude.

259
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,019
Wander back.

260
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah.

261
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,019
Yeah.

262
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,110
Yeah.

263
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,149
Yeah.

264
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:48,169
Yeah.

265
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:48,190
Yeah.

266
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,210
Yeah.

267
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,230
Yeah.

268
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,250
Yeah.

269
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,269
Yeah.

270
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:48,330
Yeah.

271
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:48,350
Yeah.

272
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,370
Yeah.

273
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,409
Yeah.

274
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:48,429
Yeah.

275
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:48,450
Yeah.

276
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:49,330
Yeah.

277
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,470
Yeah.

278
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,930
Yeah.

279
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,769
Yeah.

280
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:12,130
I talk to the team a lot about the power of positive energy.

281
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:18,950
I came across this presentation years ago by this lady, Amanda.

282
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:26,730
Gore and it really stuck with me. She spoke about the power of energy and that you can wake up in

283
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:33,650
the morning and you can make a choice to either be an energy giver or an energy sucker. It's a

284
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,250
choice you can make. They're both as powerful as each other. They're both contagious. I wake up

285
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:48,089
every morning. I try and get to the gym if I can and I always go to work with a positive mindset

286
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,490
before the kids go to school every day. I say, kids, don't just have a good day,

287
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,829
have a great day. They roll their eyes every time and they're like, dad.

288
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,930
But I know that even if 10% of it gets through, I'll be happy that they have a great day.

289
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:12,589
When I go to work, sometimes you underestimate the impact you have on other people. When I go

290
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:18,069
into a meeting, I make the choice that I want to have a good day. I make the choice that I want to

291
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:18,089
have a good day. I make the choice that I want to have a good day. I make the choice that I want to

292
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:22,630
have a great meeting. I want to greenhouse rather than what we call shithousing and a lot of it's

293
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,430
sort of body language. So I'll start a meeting with a bit of banter, a joke, have a bit of fun,

294
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:33,289
tell them I'm excited about the meeting. And then you get the best out of people because people

295
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:37,470
are going to be more, put their ideas out there that you can greenhouse and talk about.

296
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,890
Whereas if you go into that meeting and you're grumpy, you've just had a fight with your wife,

297
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,069
the kids are doing your head in and you can just suck the energy,

298
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:53,549
out of that room very quickly and be an energy sucker. And you'll watch your team just go into

299
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,250
their shell. And it's something that's really stuck with me. Now, of course, there are times

300
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,569
when there are tough times where you have always got to be authentic and you have to deliver tough

301
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:07,470
messages. But most of the time you can make a choice whether you're going to be an energy giver

302
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,609
or an energy sucker. And all my life, I prefer to be glass half full than glass half empty.

303
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,869
Love the opportunity to go back and listen to some of the conversations we had throughout 2023.

304
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:23,349
To connect with Stephanie Alexander, Peggy O'Neill, Kirsten Ferguson and Richard Oppie was a great

305
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:28,230
privilege. And you could see the patterns that emerged from great people doing inspiring things.

306
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,390
Certainly love the sense of enthusiasm and passion that every one of those people have for what they

307
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,829
do. A real sense of self-awareness and reflecting on the impact you're actually having on others

308
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:43,589
is a consistent theme across the conversations this year. And how there is a place for well-crafted

309
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:47,990
constructive criticism, that feedback is something that is important. It can be a gift.

310
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,670
It's delivered the right way. And when it's delivered with empathy, it's a real common

311
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,349
theme that we saw across the year. And your ability to choose between giving energy or

312
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:02,730
taking it away from others is a choice that you can make. I hope you found it as fascinating as

313
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,930
I did and learned a lot from the people that we connected with this year on the Empowering Leaders

314
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,210
podcast. Huge thanks to all the guests who featured on this episode. You can find the

315
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,029
links to their full length conversations with each of them in the show notes. I encourage you to go

316
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,670
back and listen.

317
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:23,109
Over the summer, our next Success Leaves Clues episode, we're curating the tips and strategies

318
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:29,009
told to us by leaders across the globe on how they most effectively create and share their vision.
