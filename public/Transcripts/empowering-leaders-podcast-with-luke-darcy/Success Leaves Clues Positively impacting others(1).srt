1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,839
I think a lot of people can go to work these days and not feel like they're seen or heard.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,779
Enabling and empowering everyone else in the team to be able to share their vision.

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:23,120
If we started caring for each other and speak to each other and listen to understand, which I work on every day, Luke, we need to care for each other more.

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:31,559
It's a privilege to have spent another year sitting across from inspiring leaders at the top of their game as they unpack the learnings and life lessons from their chosen field.

5
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,539
At Alita, we know there are consistent dimensions of what great leadership looks like, and we're covering them all in this special series.

6
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:46,659
In our work, we see so many people in positions of leadership who are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment on a daily basis.

7
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:57,520
Each week on the Empowering Leaders series, we hear from people across a range of industries, champions of education, social venture, the arts, the business world, or legends from the world of sport.

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,520
And when it comes to the idea of having a positive impact on others.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,019
We had a difficult time narrowing it down to just this select group of people you're about to hear from.

10
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:22,819
You'll hear from Valerie Condos-Field, a U.S. college coaching legend voted as the Pac-12 Coach of the Century, a UCLA Coaching Hall of Famer, a seven-time national champion across a remarkable 29 years as the head of gymnastics at UCLA.

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,120
And Whipper, Michael Whipper-Whipfly, multiple award-winning radio presenter and comedian who has used his microphone for good.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Over the years, supporting and raising thousands of dollars for youth-related charities across Australia.

13
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:46,959
This year, he successfully campaigned to change national legislation that increases the age when children are legally able to access social media from 13 to 16.

14
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:55,159
Let's begin with the remarkable Zoe Killar, who is literally changing the world for good through her social media platform that she's built and created.

15
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,680
She's a serial tech entrepreneur of great success.

16
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,040
She's turned her attention to try.

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,420
To create social media for good, you need to check out We Are Right.

18
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,019
All the other governments are suing the social networks.

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,219
They're talking about it.

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
It's very simple.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
It is damaging for society.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,539
It's fueling, knowingly fueling teen suicide and self-harm.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:28,520
It's knowingly making our societies, I would argue, it's just dumbing everything down, making people feel really not valued.

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,219
So just stop.

25
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:41,560
Just stop governments, take a stand, ban it, because there's an evolution now, but because that process is too slow, we've just got to get on with it.

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:57,560
So it's a tough old road, but with thanks to amazing women and men like you advocating and getting in the trenches with us, because I look at young girls that want to be engineers or reimagine things.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,099
And I don't want it.

28
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:14,759
To be this path, we need to be able to absolutely be free to imagine the biggest things, work out how to do it, and have the support to execute on it.

29
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:30,199
And I can't wait to, We Are Right becomes a $100 billion company, and then we can pump, I can personally pump so much money back into founder, you know, female and diverse led teams, all the things that I want to make.

30
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:44,560
All of those things are going to make impact on using our tech, but the status quo is broken.

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,000
And there's this fragility and massive civil unrest from an economic perspective that is simply not sustainable.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,199
I know it's almost laughable that on a macro level we think there is so much, the economic divide doesn't work.

33
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,840
The greed from big tech doesn't work.

34
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,740
Our society, these are self-harming and suiciding, the mental health of Black people.

35
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,800
They're also playing chess with what health schönheit or health health, not as many women, our health is of multiple shades of yellow.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Really fast growth, zero and everything else going on.

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,759
It's a pair of things,入 στο erzähل.

38
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:58,919
The geopolitical shift of how we make impact on the friends of millennials infriendly elsewhere.

39
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,300
Think about that, we'll be happy to use it.

40
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,159
We're going to be able to make impact on the people that are doing their records at once.

41
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:09,199
crisis is an epidemic the climate is screaming for our help at what point do we say oh shit we

42
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,279
better do something about about this i'm one of those people that ends up and some people probably

43
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:25,819
wouldn't believe this but i overanalyze self all the time i mean i i remember when um you know when

44
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:33,060
my mom i grew up in a really working class area and you know mom and dad both worked dad was a

45
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,959
doctor mom was a nurse you know the shopping it was you know i remember being at the supermarket

46
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:47,639
and her holding items back before going through did we have enough money to have everything we

47
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:55,279
wanted and i remember feeling i'm high high empathy so i'd feel the pain and i just wanted

48
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:02,040
out of way i didn't want her to feel like that i could feel the it was really really intense for me

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:09,180
as a kid and i could feel it all around me when it was too strong i used to hold my breath because i

50
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,180
couldn't and mom would say darling you've got to breathe you've got because i just couldn't if i

51
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,860
saw someone doing something really abusive or anything i just couldn't i i absorbed it so i

52
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,800
had to learn to stop it

53
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:34,100
so i think for me there's a real i just want to help i want to do things for others and i think

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,420
if we all did a little bit for others god we'd live in a beautiful society you know i think if

55
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,360
we if we started caring for each other and speak to each other and listen to understand which i

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,660
work on every day um but it's it's we need to care for each other more

57
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:04,279
you know i hear those comments that your beautiful uh commentating colleague went through

58
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:11,079
and i just think no one should have to go through that like that hearing that puts fire in my belly

59
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:20,819
like you have no idea like it is not okay and we just need to so yes and and how good it feels

60
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,620
when we start to care for each other that's where the joy is excellent you know that's

61
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:30,319
that's right right the highest form of living isn't it when you are contributing and what and

62
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,560
what you're doing at that level is quite remarkable and then it takes incredible skill and will to

63
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
change paradigm and a lot of people have that thought and think you know i should do this a

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,480
better way but under pressure we go back to our old habits and i suppose that is the intersection

65
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,379
of your incredible friendship as it turned out with the legendary coach john wooden and for the

66
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,660
audience that don't know about coach wooden one

67
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,420
national basketball championships in 12 seasons seven in a row no other team had won more than four

68
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,319
in a row or never has before or since he won an incredible 88 consecutive games as as coach but

69
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,120
he became an incredible mentor for you can tell everyone about how that came about well it came

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,860
about because i was i had not met coach wooden yet and i was on my way to resign and i was walking

71
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,519
through our student union and walking through the bookstore i happened upon a book

72
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:34,319
of coach wooden his leadership book and i just literally opened it up like this and it opened

73
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,920
up to his definition of success and i thought well you know what he won 10 national championships he

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,360
was hailed as the greatest coach of any sport that ever lived what does he say about winning

75
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,699
and i read success is peace of mind and knowing that you've done your best and i kept flipping

76
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,740
through the pages because i was like this made no sense to me this is like a whole

77
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:02,519
more card success is peace of mind and knowing you've done your best oh that's nice and i thought

78
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:09,300
where is he going to talk about winning coaches are hired to win we're not hired to be mentors

79
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:18,819
or second moms or dads or your pal we're hired to win so he must talk about winning and i kept

80
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,600
going through the pages and like i kept coming back to his definition of success

81
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,740
and when i was ready to

82
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:34,000
have time so i read it slowly success is peace of mind and knowing you have done your best

83
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,679
i've had the biggest aha moment of my professional career i had not been trying to be my best

84
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,279
i had been trying to be somebody else and i started connecting all the proverbial dots

85
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,779
whenever you try to be somebody else you will always be a second right them i will never

86
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,759
be as good as somebody

87
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,539
being them as they are being them and what i learned later on in my years when i tried to be

88
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,980
coach wouldn't that was equally as bad because i was never going to be as good as coach wouldn't

89
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,139
being coach would it and the worst part that happens is when you try to be somebody else

90
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:16,000
or even like somebody else it prevents you from truly developing into a first-rate you

91
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:23,299
and so i didn't resign i went back to my office and i thought what do i bring to the table as a

92
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,120
head coach of a

93
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:35,559
UCLA gymnastics team and our sport is called artistic gymnastics I grew up in the world of

94
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:45,519
ballet there was a lot of points given to artistry in our sport what do I bring well you know what

95
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,700
I can teach the artistry and movement quality and choreograph better than anybody else that's

96
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,700
gymnastics in this country I'm going to do that so that was the technical for me

97
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,779
and then I had to start thinking about though the bigger picture was

98
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:10,259
I just really did not buy into this world of athletics where it was all about winning

99
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:17,080
because it seemed really silly to me that athletics was all about being able to say

100
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,659
haha we beat you haha I beat you today haha my team's better than

101
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:21,679
your team's ever been ever been ever been ever been ever been ever been ever been ever

102
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,039
team it's like how many gazillions of dollars are spent every year in athletics there has to be more

103
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:34,259
to athletics than haha we beat you so what is that and then it became really clear once I got the

104
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:43,019
noise out of haha we beat you and winning winning winning then I understood athletics

105
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,960
is a master class in teaching really really really tough life lessons you don't learn in

106
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,299
a classroom athletics teaches us about resilience and perseverance and how to fall and get back up

107
00:10:55,299 --> 00:11:00,299
athletics teaches us about being a part of team something greater than yourself athletics teaches

108
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:06,240
you all those things you do not learn in math and english and history and science and I was like oh

109
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,460
my gosh I could do this I'm going to help my student athletes become champions in life through

110
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,659
sport and my classroom is the gym

111
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,259
and I went I remember going to my athletic director and I remember saying okay I got this

112
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:29,600
but I'm not focusing on winning I'm going to focus on developing every single one of my student

113
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,519
athletes into the best superhuman superhero they can be and because I was at UCLA and because I

114
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,200
could recruit talent I knew that that would translate to the competition floor and then

115
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,919
guess what it did and we started winning with the pm right I don't even know whether it

116
00:11:48,960 --> 00:12:18,700
was the best superhuman superhero that I've ever seen I don't even know whether you're a dutton fan or you're with albanese I think for both of them you've got a real opportunity here to become a true world leader where you can actually have a major change and I'll tell you what this topic is hot in every country and slowly state by state in the U.S. you see it and other states and other countries will pull the trigger but imagine being able to hang your hat on it I mean and that's why I talk and I don't get me wrong I'm being a bit cheeky and I'm shooting from the hip here when I say if you made this an election promise

117
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,639
then you would win the vote of every Australian parent now maybe you wouldn't I know you know whatever

118
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,919
side I vote for I would definitely jump on that ship if that was on the table out of concern for

119
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,220
my kids the one thing you love more and care about more than anything else on this planet

120
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,000
so I'm cheeky when I say that and I understand it but at the same time I think they need a nudge

121
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,059
and I think they could also see the opportunity so it's fantastic that Albo came out and said

122
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,940
I love that you're doing this we see the opportunity and I think they need a nudge

123
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,279
the importance of this and then put some money into some research into tech and verification

124
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,700
which is great but you know what you can actually make that call you're the most powerful man in the

125
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,860
country and you can pull the trigger on that so if we make enough noise I mean you the prime

126
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:13,379
the prime minister works for us does you realize that he works for us you and me and anybody else

127
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,720
listening so we need to remind him of what's important to us we're going to tell him what we

128
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,940
need so he can do it he can do it he can do it he can do it he can do it he can do it he can do it

129
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,639
he can lead and implement so we just need to remind him what he needs to do for us and I think

130
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,740
you've thrown that challenge down nicely it's right when election cycles come around really

131
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,279
quickly I think this is a thing that almost unites every parent no one thinks this is a good thing

132
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,340
and we all need help because if as you said if you're the only parent removing social media from

133
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,220
your kid they are going to be the outlier we need this is this is where governments can do good

134
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,940
and do it easily and have no negative effect there is no downside what advantage is there

135
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,700
to giving a kid social media at 13 there is no upside and we now know irrefutably we're actually

136
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,120
harming and losing children as a result of it so that doesn't make sense no it just doesn't make

137
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,179
any sense that's the other thing and and I'm sure a lot of parents do they'd be going mad when they

138
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,120
think let's just I mean let's run the pub test over this and I'm I can't understand why we're

139
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,820
okay with that and you know there's a great a great quote the other day that we will look back

140
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,940
and think what will we do we're going to do this we're going to do this we're going to do this we're

141
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,200
doing what were we doing to our kids did you know that back in the day there weren't seatbelts in

142
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,840
the car and you could drink as much as you want and drive you're kidding who would do that they

143
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,820
did I did sit on my dad's lap and uh steer the wheel with her back back in the day it was johnny

144
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,940
johnny whipfully used to get behind the wheel and he knew he was going straight because he could feel

145
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,480
the tram lines under the tires it's not that long ago whipper is it and I know and people don't

146
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,179
know that dad used to say it was illegal to be gay oh no what are you talking about crazy so I feel

147
00:14:55,179 --> 00:15:00,779
like we have all this data that's been collected over the past 10 years or so and now we're in a

148
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,200
position to be able to present it let's not let's not stretch this set of data required we don't

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,320
need any more it's all on the table and it's all in front of us so let's not consider this trial

164
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,259
griggs one of the most loved and respected figures in australian television history and

165
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,000
the first australian woman to solely host an olympic games for the past two decades and more

166
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,980
joe has been a mainstay of channel seven's olympic and paralympic coverage and the incredibly

167
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,679
successful better homes and gardens followed by tess madgen captain the australian women's

168
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,700
basketball team the opals who has represented australia at the tokyo and paris olympic games

169
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,299
we had a promo going many many bosses back at seven where i feel very safe to say it

170
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,399
they wanted all of their network talent in bikinis running along the beach slapping each other

171
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,360
yep and i was just like no yeah and they were like why not you've been in plenty of causes in

172
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,259
your life i'm like a hundred percent they said you you modeled for inside sport i said i did as

173
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:08,079
an athlete yeah a hundred percent and i said well put it this way i'll do it when you have bruce

174
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,759
mcavaney in a pair of slugos running on the beach hitting i don't know a couple of guys on the ass

175
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,279
how about that and that was the end of the conversation but it was just like those those

176
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,940
moments and and i got even though i was a little bit of a fan of the olympic games i was a fan of the

177
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,440
even as recently as after the olympics and paralympics i had one of the male bosses sit

178
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,140
down and because i'd called him out on some bad behavior he basically wanted to talk to me about

179
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:34,039
what was i missing my kids and i was like what like my kids at that stage 27 and 26 like one

180
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,240
at that stage lived in cans and you know they're very very confident very you know self-assured

181
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,039
and very self-efficient young men i'm like how many men do you have this conversation with

182
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,000
because i'm fine he's like well but you must miss your husband and i'm like

183
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,799
is having the greatest time of his life at the moment like we've probably been together enough

184
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,220
through covid that he could not wait till i got sent away for six months and he missed me long

185
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,079
enough that by the time i got back it was just it was awesome for our relationship like we had so

186
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,900
much fun seeing each other again but but literally i was just saying to him hang on before i answer

187
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,619
any of this when have you last had a conversation with a man about these things like what has this

188
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:14,279
got to do with anything and it actually came out that he just didn't want me to call him out on

189
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,819
his bad behavior yeah and you will consistently i said well don't behave

190
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,720
and there's the answer we haven't got a problem it's it's genius and we see ladies are really

191
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,839
conscious around on a daily basis how they positively impact people in the environment

192
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,460
they're in this is right to your forehand uh do you conscious about that impacting people

193
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,980
positively or yeah i think um i think a lot of people can go to work these days and not feel

194
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,559
like they're seen or heard and i think feeling like you're not heard is horrible but feeling

195
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,259
like no one even sees you is horrendous so yeah i make a conscious effort you know to make sure i'm

196
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,400
in our production office now lots of presenters might not ever go in there but it's about going

197
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,279
around and talking to each person and finding out a little bit about their lives and their families

198
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,180
and you know i remember doing a big um like a big weekend up at the farm we had 110 from better

199
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,299
homes and it was just fascinating watching other people look at other people and go oh she's got

200
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:14,200
six kids now i know why she tries to get out the door at 4 30 in the afternoon you know like she's

201
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,680
she starts earlier but she she's getting out the door because she actually wants to be present

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,480
and this is well before covid where that was even something that was even considered so again it's

203
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,920
about humanizing all those people around you so that you have a greater understanding of what

204
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,720
makes them tick there are going to be some people who have severe anxiety or there's going to be

205
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,579
some people who you know i hate walking in front of a room full of people i don't know

206
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:42,839
um you've got to let all those people still be heard and be seen every time we come together

207
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,740
we talk about winning the gold medal and i think not manifesting it but having that as a clear

208
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,200
vision and then what we have to do to achieve that i think we're in a really good space on the

209
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,319
basketball court but just keeping that culture and that connection going and enabling and empowering

210
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,240
everyone else in the team to be able to share their vision and and what they want the paris

211
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,619
olympics to be like and where they want the team to go i think is really important so as much as

212
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,640
you know sandy and i can say our vision is to win a gold medal we need to make sure everyone's

213
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,940
aligned with that and everyone's idea on how we do that could be a really important thing to do

214
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,859
be different and making sure we try and incorporate everyone's ideas when you're leading a national

215
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:29,160
team everyone is a leader so just trying to empower that um and so everyone can show up as

216
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,500
their best most authentic self every day is probably a dream vision of any leader um and i

217
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,059
think by doing that ultimately you will have success sign me up tess i mean you've got me

218
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:46,119
going uh on that it sounds like a great culture you've got and sandy's such a legend as well and

219
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,619
have great people and lauren jackson at 43

220
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,660
you can picture it something special uh about to happen curiosity is a word that we use and hear a

221
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,980
lot of and through being curious we see people are constantly trying to learn and develop is

222
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,200
curiosity something that resonates with you a hundred percent but before i started a leader

223
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,480
i thought like i wasn't very curious and i thought i was like really set in my ways and

224
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,720
i can be like that for sure but i think just by always trying to be the best version of myself

225
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,900
trying to patty crips we had to say nice

226
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,299
about each other the other day and patty said that i exhaust myself trying to always better

227
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,640
myself and i was like oh that's really really true but i think that is being curious just

228
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,480
always trying to push the boundaries push myself you know ask for help ask people what they think

229
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,460
i didn't really realize till i started a leader that that is being curious and

230
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,380
probably i thought that was my weakest thing as a leader but it probably is my biggest strength so

231
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,940
just knowing all that now is is massive and i wouldn't have had that if i didn't have that

232
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,279
opportunity if it wasn't for a leader and you find that reinforcing when you've got people

233
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,460
who've achieved a lot that are in your corner say hey tess we see you as this great athlete and this

234
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,700
great leader and has that been beneficial for you yeah it was a beautiful thing we did the other

235
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,799
week i'm a crier like i've had some tears during this but um on a leader i probably cried four

236
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,359
times like i find it really hard to express that i'm proud of myself so whenever i do that i just

237
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,680
tend to cry so when we were yeah the new thing

238
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,039
a leader is that i think after the eight week block now everyone in the group goes around and

239
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:30,619
says how they've impacted um each other but we we were at our 12 month mark the other day and we did

240
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:37,420
that exercise and i was crying oh stop please and stace um who's our facilitator she's amazing

241
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,240
daily was like stace we need to give you a compliment and she's like no no but she said

242
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,680
like we do this because it is lonely being up the top and it's really nice to hear positive

243
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,940
things about yourself so that was amazing

244
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,359
i really love that exercise and i'll definitely be um taking it into the opals so look out guys

245
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,279
i'm coming for you yeah brilliant answer and i love that idea is that not asking someone to do

246
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:04,140
something you wouldn't do yourself and we see people like you have had great success and really

247
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,380
conscious how they positively impact other people every day in their environment you're about to go

248
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,400
into a paris olympic games how do you think about positively impacting others oh great question i

249
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,880
think for a memory from my tokyo olympics was rowey webbs who the captain of the sting

250
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,019
is a water polo team just how positive she was around the village and she made everyone feel

251
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,099
like they belong the olympics is quite overwhelming you're rubbing shoulders with the best of the best

252
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,319
athletes in the world and you can get a bit of imposter syndrome but having someone like that

253
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,559
around who was so evanescent and vivacious and bubbly and willing to go the extra mile to make

254
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,720
every single member of that olympic team feel included um i really hope to do that um at paris
