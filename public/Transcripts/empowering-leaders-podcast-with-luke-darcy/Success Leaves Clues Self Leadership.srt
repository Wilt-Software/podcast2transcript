1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,759
What a great privilege it's been sitting across from different leaders and different backgrounds

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,000
throughout this year and each leadership story for me is so unique with so much wisdom in it.

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:17,679
At Alita we know that there are consistent dimensions of what great leadership looks like

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,019
and we'll cover them over the next seven episodes. Really keen to start with the idea of self

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,660
leadership because we understand that it's difficult to lead well unless you've got a

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,359
great sense of what your own self-leadership means to you and how to lead yourself well.

7
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,219
On every Empowering Leaders episode we hear from people at the top of their industry from sport

8
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,159
to business, education, social venture and the arts and when it comes to the dimension of

9
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,140
self-leadership we knew we were sitting on a goldmine of wisdom from the selection of guests

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,659
you're about to hear from. Starting with Danielle Laidley whose journey to understand herself

11
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,939
for me is just about the most remarkable one I've ever heard in my life.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,759
I get this from my

13
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,099
from my son he said to me there's only one person that can can do this and that's you

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:17,219
and you need to be you and you need to be strong and you need to live your life and and by doing

15
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:25,180
that people will see you how I see you with the platforms we've had through the book and the

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,739
documentary your your leadership or your role modeling will be just you living as you and

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,640
and showing people that you can get through that you you can be honest and can be raw and can be

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:49,780
vulnerable which I think does in in society these days that attracts people. I know now by me being

19
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,920
me I didn't ever think it would end up like this I was just me wanting to be me living my life

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,739
and I've sort of been anointed as a transgender community role model and that and that's the

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,700
first I was a bit oh I don't know about that you know because generally we know in any any change or

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,840
any sort of leadership the first person who walks through the door usually cops one on the beak

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:23,520
and if that has to be me um that's me um but but I'll do it my own way you know and when we're

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,800
talking about this self self-leadership by living my life and by having the platforms which I'm I'm

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,740
very lucky to have that people can do it their own way and I'm very lucky to have that people can

26
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,599
people people can't be what they can't see and that was certainly me growing growing up Donna and

27
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:46,099
I both literally get hundreds of messages a day and particularly over the last month with the doco

28
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,620
parents grandparents um transgender people themselves saying thank you for what you're

29
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,599
doing and we're just living our life but we're living in a way that people see part of our life

30
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,599
in in public and that gives great reason for

31
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,240
families of transgender people um or transgender people themselves to be able to be authentic and

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,500
be themselves present their best possible self and I think that's all that I'm doing

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,259
Tim Jarvis is an explorer environmental scientist author and leadership expert and he's a winner of

34
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:26,939
the Australian Geographic Society's Conservationist of the Year Award he's taken on some extraordinary

35
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,680
challenges including re-enacting two of the harshest most extreme Antarctic

36
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,139
survival journeys well I think about my own motivations I think about being true to myself

37
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,740
and what my moral compass looks like but I also have a sense of humility it's interesting I was

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,280
having a very interesting conversation the other day with some sports psychologists and they were

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,180
talking about the difference between the psychology of leadership in a team sport context where you're

40
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,780
up against human opposition and leadership in the context of say the mountains or Antarctica or the

41
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,159
ocean

42
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,520
and at the end of the day the difference is that one involves working up against human opposition

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:16,079
whereas in the outdoors it's just you and what you can bring and nature is the thing you're

44
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,399
not up against but you're working with I suppose and that brings about a real sense of humility

45
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,079
you don't take seriously the things you've achieved before your CV of previous accomplishments

46
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,740
doesn't mean anything to nature so I bring that humility to each situation I find myself in and I

47
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,920
think that's an essential part of how I deal with it it's important everybody meets to be honest

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,199
don't take myself very seriously take what I do seriously when I'm there I think that's a very

49
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,920
important very important aspect to it all and I understand my own limitations and weaknesses

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,660
enough to sort of recruit the right people to help fill those gaps and make up shortfalls in that

51
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,019
area and I think being honest with yourself and honest with others about your weaknesses also

52
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,740
engenders a sense of sort of tragedy and I think that's a very important aspect to it and I think that's

53
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,500
trust and respect amongst your team.

54
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,000
Fleur McIntyre is the former head of exercise and sports science

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,180
at the University of Notre Dame in Australia.

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,360
But she's now breaking new ground for female coaches

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,180
after leading the Sydney Kings to back-to-back championships

58
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,980
in just her first two seasons as their assistant coach.

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,779
I think the capacity to reflect and seek feedback

60
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,860
on the things that you're doing.

61
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,699
I'm really lucky that I'm always seeking.

62
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,819
I have an idea in my head and I reflect,

63
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,040
but it's nice to get that feedback from people

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,199
that are watching me coach, understanding from the players

65
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,399
the things that they need.

66
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,300
And as I keep evolving and growing, things that I could perhaps

67
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,759
do better on this leadership journey and things where I'm strong

68
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,579
but there's the capacity for me to grow.

69
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,959
So the self-leadership for me is obviously looking internally

70
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,939
and being able to reflect, but I also seek opinions

71
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,399
from people that are important to me.

72
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,620
So Luke and our new coach, Mahmood, my peers, Daniel Kickett,

73
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,560
that I get to coach with, I want their feedback on things

74
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,839
that they think I'm doing well and things that I can prove

75
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,839
and also the players that I'm working with.

76
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,920
So self-leadership for me is taking on some ownership

77
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,839
of looking at yourself and attempting to grow,

78
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,379
not just staying stationary where you are,

79
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,600
always being willing to move forward, change things up,

80
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,779
show some initiative, innovation and go from there.

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Nick Stone is a former Australian rules footballer

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,839
and manager of the Australian Football League.

83
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,879
He's now the founder and CEO of Blue Stone Lane,

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,779
a truly awesome international hospitality success story.

85
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,839
After opening his first Blue Stone Lane coffee shop

86
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,660
in midtown Manhattan, they've now expanded

87
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,439
to more than 60 stores across the US.

88
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,680
I think you just need to know who you are and what motivates you

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,920
and what you're passionate about, what your values are.

90
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,300
And I think when you're comfortable with yourself,

91
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,620
you're going to be comfortable with others.

92
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,660
And you'll also be a much more,

93
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,040
impactful leader because you'll be your authentic self.

94
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,180
And I think you can present with that vulnerability

95
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,620
that you don't have all the answers,

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,839
that you're using these signals to form a view

97
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,459
and that you're open to feedback on certain things

98
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,360
and maybe others that you've got a really strong view

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,980
that like, I appreciate your comments,

100
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,160
but like, I'm going this way.

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,819
And that's that self-confidence and surety that you need.

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,779
And I think doing that investment,

103
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,720
and for me, I didn't do that investment enough

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,220
when I was playing AFL.

105
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,740
I hid my emotions.

106
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,180
I hid the way I was feeling.

107
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,100
And when my AFL career finished,

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,319
it was liberating that it was over.

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,699
I was deeply sad that I probably didn't achieve my childhood dreams,

110
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,839
but it was liberating that I could probably be myself a bit more

111
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,819
and attack my next career with more reckless abandon,

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
with just confidence and to go for it.

113
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,360
I found that it's hard when you do a lot of self-assessment

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,079
and especially as a CEO,

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
but it takes a lot to make yourself,

116
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,939
that vulnerable to take it on and to change.

117
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,819
And everyone, I found that I can change

118
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,399
and sometimes we'll slip back and you need that reminder.

119
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,579
And I'm very fortunate that both my family support network,

120
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,740
both at home here,

121
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,639
but also in the business with my brother working there

122
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,839
can always give me the tap on the shoulder and say,

123
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,779
listen, I think you could handle that a little bit differently.

124
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,839
I appreciate that what you're trying to say,

125
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,660
but the way that you articulate it

126
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,199
might not be as impactful for someone else.

127
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,500
And,

128
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,199
you know,

129
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,700
that's something that I think we're probably,

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,600
everyone's on a journey and it's always evolving

131
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,019
because communication styles have changed so dramatically

132
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,379
with technology and social media

133
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,480
and the way that people process information

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,500
and how they receive information.

135
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,059
Coming up,

136
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,000
you're about to hear from Liz Ellis,

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,159
Jason Kimberley,

138
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
Larry Kesselman,

139
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,720
Kemi Nekvapel

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,139
and Sandy Brondello.

141
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,460
So far,

142
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,080
it's been great hearing from Danny,

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,580
Tim,

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,320
Fleur and Nick.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,440
And I love their conviction around authenticity being true.

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,919
To yourself

147
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,980
and also not taking yourself too seriously

148
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,419
at the same time,

149
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,940
having the humility to self-reflect and self-connect

150
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,120
and to always be able to come back

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,679
to where you're comfortable with yourself

152
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,179
and align with your values.

153
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,659
I know I learned something from each and every one of them.

154
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,519
At Alita,

155
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,539
we bring together groups of five to six people

156
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,580
and a lot of them you've heard from just now

157
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,360
in these collaborative groups

158
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,840
where we know leadership at times is lonely.

159
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,159
The idea of learning and sharing and collaborating

160
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,500
is something we're incredibly passionate about.

161
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,139
Love you.

162
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,320
We'd love for you to get involved as well.

about your leadership journey.

169
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,879
I'd like to say a huge thank you to Jason Nicholas

170
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,000
and his team from Temper

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,679
for their ongoing support of the Empowering Leaders podcast

172
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,600
and bringing these stories to the table

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,480
each and every week.

174
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,220
Temper is a mattress like no other.

175
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,860
Almost all the leaders we talk to

176
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,639
understand the value of great sleep

177
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,419
to live a happy and successful life.

178
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,620
So investing in the world's best embedding

179
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,059
with Temper,

180
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,539
is a decision that will seriously change your life.

181
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,519
Big thanks to Temper,

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,940
a mattress like no other.

183
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,919
The next group of guests all speak to how self-leadership

184
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,100
has driven them to the highest level of success.

185
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,519
Let's go first to the inspirational Sandy Brondello,

186
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,399
coach of the New York Liberty in the WNBA.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,120
Well, I think that's the most important thing.

188
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,480
I know people always ask me,

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,039
I mean, what kind of leader am I?

190
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,460
Like I talk, I'm a servant leader

191
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,399
because I want to help others

192
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,919
to be the very best that they can be.

193
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:29,919
But self-leadership,

194
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,179
self-leadership is making sure

195
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,360
you're looking yourself in the mirror

196
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,559
and what are my strengths?

197
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,019
What are the areas I need to work on?

198
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,860
How can I impact people's lives?

199
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,919
Because that's what you're doing as a leader

200
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,440
in a positive way.

201
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,279
And that doesn't mean it's always rosy,

202
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,399
but you can still impact people's lives

203
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,299
in a positive way.

204
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,960
And, you know, that self-reflection,

205
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,159
it's always continued to grow,

206
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,120
that self-leadership.

207
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,600
But I always say,

208
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,740
don't be something that you're not

209
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,559
when you take over a leadership role.

210
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,419
Because I tell my players,

211
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,899
you will see consistency out of me every day.

212
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,480
Win, lose, whatever.

213
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,639
Because that's a part of the journey.

214
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,139
And I want them to make sure

215
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,519
we're in this journey together.

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,340
And if we can stay together,

217
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,379
great things can happen.

218
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,860
Jason Kimberley is a world traveler and adventurer

219
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,840
whose eclectic life experiences

220
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,740
led him to publishing two books

221
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,200
and becoming the founder and CEO of Cool.org.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,720
The free online platform

223
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,659
has supported more than 175,000 educators

224
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,659
in building a greater understanding

225
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,059
of critical environmental and social issues.

226
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,759
I don't know anything else.

227
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,419
You know, I don't have gears.

228
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,639
I once heard Mick Molloy comment on his acting

229
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,899
and said it's 5% either way of Mick Molloy.

230
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,000
You know, so I think whatever I do

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,100
is 5% either way of Jason Kimberley.

232
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,279
You know, a few mates of mine

233
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,139
have got fairly high profile public lives.

234
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,820
And when they said to me early on,

235
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,059
when they were sort of diving into it,

236
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
you know, you've got the thing,

237
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,340
I said, just be yourself.

238
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,080
I said, the sooner you can be yourself in your job,

239
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,779
don't be what anyone,

240
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,539
what you think anyone wants you to be,

241
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:58,919
be yourself.

242
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,120
And the sooner you can,

243
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,000
be yourself in life.

244
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,379
Some people die without being themselves.

245
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,840
They're always trying to please other people

246
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,679
or whatever it is.

247
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,059
But I think I worked it out in the early 20s

248
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,080
that the quicker you can be yourself,

249
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,940
and I mean legitimately yourself,

250
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,019
not holding back,

251
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,299
not putting on something false that's not you.

252
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,139
And I sometimes get into trouble.

253
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,059
It can be a bit tricky.

254
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,879
Let's be clear.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,820
But if you're not your true self,

256
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,860
who the hell are you?

257
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,759
You're poncing around,

258
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,659
trying to impress people that you don't like,

259
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,519
you know, to care about you.

260
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,340
You know, so I just think

261
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,919
my advice on leadership is

262
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,620
absolutely,

263
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,080
be you and whatever that is.

264
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,820
And it's difficult to be yourself.

265
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,539
That to me is critical in leadership.

266
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,059
And the sooner you can do that,

267
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,860
it's that.

268
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,940
And the other thing I would say,

269
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,279
that is not caring what other people think.

270
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,600
I know that's a trite thing to say,

271
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,240
but it's none of my business

272
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
what people think of me.

273
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,299
You know, I get the odd secondhand story

274
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,700
and they're usually wildly inaccurate.

275
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,159
My reputation exceeds me, Dars.

276
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,759
But if you can legitimately not care

277
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,320
about what other people think,

278
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,059
coupled with being yourself,

279
00:12:59,139 --> 00:12:59,980
I think that,

280
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,559
to me, it's the secret to success.

281
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,139
Liz Ellis is one of the most respected names

282
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,320
in Australian sport.

283
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,799
She's a lawyer by trade,

284
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,740
arguably Australia's best ever netball player,

285
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,360
an experienced broadcaster

286
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,139
and the most recent winner

287
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,440
of Australia's

288
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,379
I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.

289
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,250
It means a couple of things.

290
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,610
That means I reflect on my behaviour often.

291
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,429
I think self-reflection is really important.

292
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:28,769
And when I was in a team

293
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:29,909
and a leader within the team,

294
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,389
I'd often reflect on conversations that I'd had

295
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:33,690
or things that went,

296
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,830
went wrong or went right in the game.

297
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:35,730
What was my role?

298
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,809
How could I do that better?

299
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,250
And I've always been a bit harsh on myself

300
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,309
in that regard,

301
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,509
because I think that's like,

302
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:42,649
you've got to be honest with yourself.

303
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:43,769
And if that means being hard,

304
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,490
then so be it.

305
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,450
Sometimes I think my self-talk could be better.

306
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,509
But the last thing I,

307
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,450
and the world needs is me with a bigger ego.

308
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,090
So, you know,

309
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,129
but I do engage in a lot of self-reflection

310
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,450
just at home or, you know,

311
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,269
when I'm on the plane or driving somewhere.

312
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,450
A lot of people who are successful do that

313
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,049
because, you know,

314
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,610
one of the great things that sport teaches,

315
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:03,669
you know,

316
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,309
is you can blame the umpire,

317
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,210
but then you lose control of changing anything.

318
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,190
So actually look at yourself first.

319
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,950
So that's where I started with self-reflection.

320
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,909
And I'm really careful about,

321
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:14,690
I don't know that you can achieve balance

322
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,250
because you always have crazy moments,

323
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,190
but I'm really careful about having nice things

324
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,370
to look forward to, right?

325
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,210
Because that makes you a better leader

326
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,149
because you're more centered.

327
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,429
You're able to focus on the moment

328
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,909
because you know something good's coming,

329
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,289
which drives Matthew insane

330
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:29,610
because I'm always wanting to book holidays.

331
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,490
But like, it's just about looking after yourself

332
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:32,950
and,

333
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,149
and allowing yourself to be in a happy place

334
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,889
because you've got a few other things under control.

335
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,169
And the big thing I've learned,

336
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,269
especially since having kids is the power of saying no.

337
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,889
I used to think I had to say yes to everything,

338
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,889
especially when I left the law firm and went freelance.

339
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,250
I was like, oh my God,

340
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,029
this job could be my last,

341
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:49,970
but I've survived,

342
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,269
I don't know,

343
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,490
25 years doing that.

344
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:55,350
So now I understand that I can say no,

345
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,210
especially if it doesn't suit what I'm doing with my family.

346
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,490
And that makes me a better leader

347
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,529
because when I'm there or wherever I am,

348
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,429
I'm actually really invested in it

349
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,210
because I know that I've given myself space

350
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,149
to be with my family

351
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,669
and to do the things that I like to do.

352
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,629
Larry Kesselman sold Dodo,

353
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,929
the telecommunications business he founded,

354
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,149
for close to $250 million back in 2013

355
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,669
with a unique ability to turn his attention

356
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,450
to a diverse range of industries and passions.

357
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,169
With remarkable consistent success,

358
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,710
he's now a billionaire property developer

359
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,269
and owner of the National Basketball League in Australia.

360
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,490
I think it's being able

361
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,669
to control your emotions.

362
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,990
It's being able to have your own conversations

363
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,230
and being honest with yourself.

364
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,029
I think if you're living a lie

365
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,509
and you're not actually honest where you're at,

366
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:42,389
that is a problem.

367
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,509
You've got to start there.

368
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,269
I think if you stop being a keen learner,

369
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,850
I think that's a problem.

370
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,590
How do I lead others?

371
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,909
And the longer I lead others,

372
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:53,450
the smarter they are around me.

373
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,870
Like the people that are coming into my world now

374
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,610
are bloody smart people.

375
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,509
So if I don't keep improving myself

376
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,450
and keep learning,

377
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,929
that's a problem.

378
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:02,330
So,

379
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,389
I think that concept of

380
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,669
the way the Western world has decided

381
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,970
that you get some sort of a certificate after school

382
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,830
and college,

383
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,210
you're done with studying

384
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,570
is a very dangerous one.

385
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:12,870
So,

386
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,649
for me as a leader,

387
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,730
I want people that are keen learners,

388
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,870
that are open to learning,

389
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:18,990
that are self-critical,

390
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,450
that are positive,

391
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:21,570
but at the same time,

392
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,590
realize that you never stop learning

393
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,590
and it's a journey.

394
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,029
So,

395
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,490
my leadership style

396
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,590
is to care about others

397
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,570
and their evolution

398
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,049
and how can I help them.

399
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:31,250
So,

400
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,090
the older I get,

401
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,090
and I'm an operator by nature,

402
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,610
but the older I get,

403
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,610
the less I'm actually running

404
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,629
and operating businesses.

405
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:37,950
So,

406
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,509
more and more,

407
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,090
my job is strategy

408
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:43,370
and how do I actually set people up for success

409
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,169
and mentor them

410
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,269
and help them

411
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,690
and not just around business,

412
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,990
but actually just help them

413
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,629
be the best version of themselves.

414
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,809
They'll need to do what they need to do,

415
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,350
but my job is to help them

416
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,649
find that happiness.

417
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,409
Kemi Nekvipil

418
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,590
trained under Dr. Brené Brown

419
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,110
and is one of Australia's

420
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,529
leading credentialed coaches

421
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,070
for female and male coaches.

422
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,269
She's also an author

423
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:06,970
and a highly sought-after

424
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,170
international speaker.

425
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,190
Oh, 100%.

426
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,170
And I think the beautiful thing about that is,

427
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,930
and this is the work.

428
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,970
We think that work is this thing outside of us

429
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,410
that we, you know,

430
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,710
get in the car to get to or something,

431
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,029
but actually the ultimate work

432
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:26,930
is the work on self.

433
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,490
And so,

434
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,230
we all want to follow leaders

435
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,470
who are self-aware

436
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,809
of how they impact the people around them.

437
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,170
We want to be around leaders

438
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,130
that can identify the humanity in us

439
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,109
because they can identify

440
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,369
the humanity in themselves.

441
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,609
And I've literally just come off the back

442
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:43,609
of doing a Dare to Lead retreat yesterday.

443
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:44,650
And, you know,

444
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,109
that is the context of the work.

445
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,390
And Brené Brown says this,

446
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,509
self-awareness matters.

447
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,250
That so many things happen

448
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,849
in organizations within leadership

449
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,009
because we're just not aware

450
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:55,750
of what we're doing.

451
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,049
We don't know that we made

452
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:57,970
that offhand comment

453
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,569
that actually made, you know,

454
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,730
one of our team members

455
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,089
kind of really off

456
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,089
for the rest of the day

457
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,670
or made them feel like they could,

458
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,150
they weren't capable at their job.

459
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,109
And we don't have

460
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,210
the tool to then go back in

461
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,069
and just check in and say,

462
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,210
hey, did I make that comment I made?

463
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,069
Did that kind of put you

464
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:12,869
offside a little bit?

465
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,670
Because I'd like to know

466
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,809
because I don't want you to feel like

467
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,170
you didn't do a great job on the project.

468
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,589
I just want to redefine

469
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,769
what the project was meant to be

470
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:19,150
or something.

471
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:21,309
I know that leaders should always

472
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,650
be doing work on themselves

473
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,150
so they can show up as for humans

474
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,569
because we want to be led by humans.

475
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,730
Yeah, that's great insight into that.

476
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:29,730
And I was looking at your

477
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,089
Dare to Lead retreats.

478
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,869
They look brilliant,

479
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:32,829
but it's something you do.

480
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,849
You bring groups of people together,

481
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,269
you know, eight to 10 to 12.

482
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:36,849
Is that right?

483
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,329
Does it spend that reflective time?

484
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:39,990
Yeah, that's right.

485
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,410
So, you know, very blessed

486
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,829
to go and train with Renee in Texas.

487
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,289
And as a coach,

488
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,490
I can now sort of add that tool set

489
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,670
of the Dare to Lead program

490
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,849
and kind of it's her IP,

491
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,630
but I get to facilitate the content.

492
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,589
These actual retreats are for women.

493
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,150
I do actually do one-to-one coaching

494
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,890
with a few good men.

495
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,869
I have to let you know that, Luke,

496
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,150
like not exclusively women.

497
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,150
I birthed a man and I'm married to a man.

498
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,910
So that all works

499
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,869
because I love to bring together

500
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,869
women of various ages

501
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:05,990
in different industries.

502
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,869
But I remember thinking

503
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:07,269
at the beginning,

504
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,589
oh, I'll do a Dare to Lead retreat

505
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,210
for entrepreneurs

506
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,589
and I'll do a Dare to Lead retreat

507
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,690
for people in organizations

508
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,490
and corporates.

509
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:13,930
And then I realized,

510
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,069
why would you do that?

511
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,710
You want to bring together

512
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,849
these two different styles of working

513
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,529
so there can be this beautiful osmosis

514
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:22,529
and people understanding

515
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,910
how it is in each other people's camp.

516
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,009
And even, you know,

517
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:26,950
everyone always says

518
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,009
one of the most powerful things

519
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,509
about having groups of people together

520
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,369
where they feel safe

521
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,430
is that you get to hear

522
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,950
that what you're going through

523
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,549
is not a solo experience,

524
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,210
that someone's either been there before

525
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,569
or they're in the middle of it.

526
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:36,650
So it's not a solo experience.

527
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,670
It's not a solo experience.

528
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:36,690
It's not a solo experience.

529
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:36,710
It's not a solo experience.

530
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,289
They're either in the middle of it

531
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:38,630
or they're on the other side of it.

532
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:39,730
And that gives you

533
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,529
a really good grounding

534
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:41,569
in your leadership

535
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,549
and your style of leadership

536
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,309
moving forward.

537
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,329
I genuinely love the idea

538
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,369
and the reflection of self-awareness

539
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,509
as a start,

540
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,750
that it really is genuinely

541
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,710
the place to start

542
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,549
to know yourself

543
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,089
and understand what enables you

544
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,910
to be the best of yourself.

545
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,250
And hearing those voices again,

546
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:58,750
so much self-awareness,

547
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,170
so much self-reflection

548
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,329
and being honest with yourself

549
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,990
and the idea of constant

550
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,289
and never-ending self-improvement.

551
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,990
You could see the patterns

552
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,509
that you're going through

553
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:06,529
and the patterns that you're going through

554
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:06,569
and the patterns that you're going through

555
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:06,690
and the patterns that you're going through

556
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,289
even though they're

557
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,250
from different backgrounds

558
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,509
around routine,

559
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,130
around that discipline,

560
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,450
around the idea

561
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,170
of potentially delaying

562
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,069
some gratification

563
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,789
to have a better life.

564
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:17,490
And I heard that

565
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,369
in so many different ways

566
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:20,910
that people show up for themselves.

567
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,190
There's freedom in the routine

568
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,190
of what makes people successful

569
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,009
and I loved listening to it

570
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,230
in a range of different ways.

571
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,589
I hope you enjoyed it

572
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:29,269
