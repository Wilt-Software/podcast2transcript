00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,599
Hello and welcome to a special edition of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:12,980
Jeff Scott is the Vice President of Football Operations for the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFL.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,059
And Jeff has been kind enough to join me only a couple of days out from Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,519
where Jeff's team, the Philadelphia Eagles, take on the Kansas City Chiefs

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,420
in what is the biggest one-day sporting event on the planet.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,600
First, I'd like to say thank you to our presenting partner, Victoria University,

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,200
who are committed to creating a place where everyone feels they belong,

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,780
opening doors to education for everyone.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,200
V, you are here to support and empower you on your journey,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,579
whether you're taking your first step towards a dream,

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,840
breaking new ground in your industry with further learning,

12
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,119
or simply chasing your next win.

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,460
And that is not unlike what Jeff Scott is planning to do in winning Super Bowl 59.

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,799
Hey, Jeff, thank you so much. I know your time is precious.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,700
Tell us about the week as Vice President of Football Operations.

16
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,039
How's it been for you?

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,640
Uh, first off, thank you, Luke. Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,180
I'm happy to be here and do this.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,819
The week has been, you know, for us, it's been good.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,980
I think this is a situation we're trying to approach it just like any other week.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,519
Of course, we all understand that it isn't, but I think in anything you do,

22
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,239
and from top down in our organization, we really approach it as,

23
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,040
it's got to be normal process.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,819
You have to repeat the process we've been doing all season and,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,540
and come down to Sunday and focus on what we've got to do.

26
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,620
Jeff, only two years ago, Super Bowl 57,

27
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,700
the same opponent, the Kansas City Chiefs.

28
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,040
From an outsider's point of view, there's a great redemption story.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,420
Is that the language you use?

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,120
Or as you said, is it just about getting the job done?

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,480
I think for us, the focus is really just going through our process and,

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,439
and focusing on what we're doing.

33
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:00,540
Yeah.

34
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,959
And what, what we need to handle, control what we can control and,

35
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,760
and go forward with that.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,139
I think, you know, obviously there are a lot of narratives and,

37
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,159
and things that can be out there, but that's not something we do.

38
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,400
We specialize in just doing what we need to do internally,

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,479
focus on ourselves and, and go out there and handle our business.

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,979
Jeff, you're an outstanding quarterback in high school and college yourself

41
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,439
before a back injury ended perhaps the dream

42
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,740
of being a professional athlete.

43
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,199
Have you found that football experience has helped you in your role now?

44
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,479
Yeah, I, I actually, um, it's funny, I played quarterback in high school and

45
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,419
then, um, I started as a quarterback in college, but I quickly moved over

46
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,300
to, uh, the defensive side of the ball.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,219
I'm only five foot eight.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,699
Uh, so sometimes seeing over the line was a, uh, little issue.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,319
Now, nowadays, uh, that's not as big of an issue with the offenses that are run, but,

50
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,280
um, I played.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,659
I played defense in college.

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:09,099
I really think what happened for me is I got injured, um, and, and had that back injury

53
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,099
and my court and defensive coordinator position coach, uh, me, Clint Daniel, he

54
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,960
actually trained me to be a coach.

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,099
Um, I was kind of the, the veteran guy in the room.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,860
So I spent a lot of time with him learning how to evaluate things, how to look at the

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,800
game from a different lens than you do as a player.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,139
And that definitely set the foundation for me going forward, um, through, through to

59
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,099
this point in my career.

60
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,199
So, um, it's one of those things that, uh, one door closes and, and the injury was, you

61
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,919
know, was something that, you know, it happens.

62
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:53,520
It's the nature of our game, but, uh, it really opened the door for me, uh, down the

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,780
line.

64
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,539
I never knew that it would get here, but that definitely, uh, set the foundation for me.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,219
So I thought we'll hear that a lot.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,680
On this podcast where something at the time that seems like a devastation, a career ending

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,500
injury, but once you get through that and experience it fully on the other side, something

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,460
maybe even greater, has that been the case for you in your life when you've had these

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,040
hurdles that have come up that when you find a way through, there's always something good?

70
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,319
Yeah, I think one of the things that you have to approach, and this is something that I,

71
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,980
it was instilled in me as a child.

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,959
Um, my, my father.

73
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,980
Actually, uh, was legally blind.

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,379
Um, he, he could see a little bit, but by definition, he couldn't, um, see completely

75
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,240
enough to ever drive a car or do kind of a lot of different things.

76
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,139
And, and my grandmother told him that doesn't matter.

77
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,680
You have to go through and, and do what you need to do in life.

78
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,819
Um, he eventually became a circuit court judge.

79
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,259
Um, he sat on the bench for years, uh, and I would be amazed.

80
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,220
His, his vision was never a deterrent for him.

81
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,139
Um, his other, uh, senses were heightened, um, which as a child growing up in his household

82
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,360
was, uh, sometimes a little, uh, could catch you a little bit.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,339
His hearing was amazing.

84
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,819
Um, but you know, um, but it's one of those things that you don't, you don't let those

85
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,759
things define you.

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,939
That's, that's the reality of things.

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
Um, I, I got injured.

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,519
I actually did.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,259
I came back and played, um, my senior year, but it wasn't.

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,040
Obviously it wasn't kind of the same.

91
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,759
Um, but you never let those things define you.

92
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,180
You really just focus on what's next and what do I need to do to overcome whatever hurdles

93
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,759
in your way?

94
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,920
I think those are opportunities more than things to kind of sit back and, and be concerned

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,240
about.

96
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah.

97
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,420
You mentioned your dad, Judge John W.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,740
Scott Jr., the first black judge in Fredericksburg where you grew up and he was a civil rights

99
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,199
pioneer.

100
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,259
And as you said, legally.

101
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,519
He was legally blind, all the obstacles in his way.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,779
And your mother, Alda, was Stafford County's first female attorney.

103
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,480
She was also the first black female full-time attorney in Virginia.

104
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,040
Exceptional people on every level.

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Can you tell us a bit more about growing up in that household and, and the influence they

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,300
had?

107
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:26,060
Yeah, no, um, it was, it was definitely something you learn to craft an argument, uh, very quickly

108
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,259
in that household.

109
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,259
If you couldn't, uh, you could, if you didn't have something specific.

110
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,779
You know, if you just bevelled out and, uh, kind of flushed out your idea, you, it wasn't

111
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,420
going anywhere.

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,860
So I, I learned that very young.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,500
Um, but I think one of the things that, that both of them, uh, instilled in me and my mom

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,339
still does to this day is at the end of the day, you just keep pushing.

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,720
You keep, keep going.

116
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,800
You always keep going forward.

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,139
You never, it's not a time to ever feel sorry for yourself.

118
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,220
Um, you set a goal.

119
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,240
You go forward.

120
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,600
it. If you say you're going to do something, you do it. You stand up for what's right. And that's

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,839
kind of some of the foundational principles that have really shaped my life. And hopefully I'm

122
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,579
going forward and passing along to my daughter. Jeff, we've been really privileged to have you

123
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,759
part of our Leader Connect program. We curate groups of five to six different leaders around

124
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,579
the globe from different backgrounds. So you've collaborated with Tom Allen from Arsenal,

125
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:33,980
Ash Hansen's an Australian footy legend and respected coach, Ben Noor, the legendary

126
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,779
conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Amanda White from the US Tennis Association and

127
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,899
doing great things. You've caught up with Andy Walsh from our community. Can you tell us about

128
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,240
collaborating with leaders around the world in that Leader Connect program, what it's meant for

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,480
you? It's been awesome. I was lucky. I was referred to the program from Daryl Franklin,

130
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,040
an old co-worker of mine.

131
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:07,759
He's in one in a group and obviously Matt LaFleur, who is in a group. So they were lucky enough to

132
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,699
kind of mention me and push me for the program. It's been great. It's something I've really

133
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:23,959
enjoyed. I think my group is fun. We've been together at this point. It feels like it's been

134
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,560
it's a little, it's almost two years at this point, but it's been great.

135
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:38,600
I think you talk about everybody's background being so different. Amanda, Amanda, you talk about

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:46,659
collaboration. Her entire job is kind of dependent on working with a million different people and

137
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:57,759
helping bring something together, which is huge. Ben is, I never knew that you could learn so much

138
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:07,200
from someone in a field that's so different. When he's talking about conducting and dealing with

139
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,740
musicians, it's really the same kind of business we are dealing with athletes. And Ben has such

140
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:24,580
great perspectives on things. Ash, I love talking to Ash. Ash is so good at being able to motivate

141
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,559
and kind of bring a perspective of how, you know, how you're going to be able to do something. And

142
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:35,600
I think, you know, he coaches and he's so aware, self-aware and aware of situations that he's been

143
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:44,299
a part of. And then Tom, I laugh. I think Tom is just, Tom's a machine. He, that Arsenal program

144
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:53,279
is, you know, obviously I watched the all or nothing and I've kind of gotten into more soccer

145
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,240
than I ever had before. But Tom's always about process.

146
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,059
And putting things together and new ideas and just being able to share with that group and

147
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:14,679
share in successes, share in challenges, hear perspectives of people who are doing things that

148
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:20,220
are very similar that on the face, like at the end of the day, what we're doing is very similar,

149
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,820
but on the face of it, it's probably nobody would make those connections. And it's been

150
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,419
great for me to,

151
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,899
self-reflect and analyze and go forward. So I've been very happy to be in the program.

152
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:41,220
Yeah, Jeff, it's a wonderful description of what we see is this great coming together when

153
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,620
inspiring people catch up and learn. And you just delved into that your reflections so easily. Is

154
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,659
that sort of curiosity part of you always searching to find a way to do things better in

155
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,379
life? Is that seems like something that's a real passion of yours?

156
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,539
Yeah, no, I think the

157
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:05,379
biggest thing we like anybody who's in a leadership position or, you know, wants to be in a

158
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:12,299
leadership position, you need to constantly kind of be on the forefront of things. I joke, you know,

159
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:18,539
I've been lucky enough here with the Eagles organization from top down for Mr. Lurie, our

160
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:25,259
general manager, Holly Roseman. He is all about pushing the envelope and going forward and trying

161
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,500
to find the next and stay out in front of the next. And you know, I think that's, I think that's

162
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,240
of things. And he's been amazing at it. It's been awesome to kind of spend the last four years here

163
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,580
learning from him and really pushing to kind of go the next, let's find what the next thing is,

164
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,659
kind of never being satisfied. And I think curiosity is in us all. It's just sometimes,

165
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:54,960
you know, you have to push yourself, you know, that's what being a leader is. And I think that

166
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,460
is something that I really strive to do. So have you spent three years with the Bank of America

167
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,740
in a global risk management role back in another lifetime? Your experience in the

168
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,539
corporate world, has that held you in good stead as a sporting exec?

169
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:17,500
Yeah, I actually, it was an amazing experience. It's something I wouldn't trade for the world.

170
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,080
You know, I started in June of 2008. And then we had the

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,940
the

172
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:24,960
the

173
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:34,139
, basically, the economy had the downturn it had that fall. And it was, while it was a very

174
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:41,360
tough time, again, it was an opportunity. It was something to learn. It was being thrust into

175
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,559
situations that, you know, nobody had dealt with and being able to react and move and think on your

176
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,700
feet. That was awesome. I joke all the time about one of the toughest conversations I ever had.

177
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:02,539
I did a year in audit, and I led an audit on a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, when Bank of America

178
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:10,080
Purpose bought Merrill Lynch. And I had to sit down with the chief credit officer and go through

179
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,440
audit issues. And he was, you know, he had been doing it as long as I had been alive at that

180
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,059
point. But those are tough conversations that we all have to go through. So when I got, you know,

181
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:23,620
on this end, I joked,

182
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,000
some of the tough conversations I've had, I had maybe the toughest one when I was 22 years old.

183
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,799
So it's great experience, really, really challenged me, just but at the end of the day,

184
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,259
I love football. Football had been a part of my life since I was five years old, and I wanted to

185
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:49,159
get back to it. So Bank of America, it was a was a great opportunity. But I just I really wanted to

186
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,500
get back into football. Jeff, I hear you've got a great passion for developing people and

187
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,299
the players in your environment at the Eagles. Can you tell us a bit about your philosophy on how

188
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:04,559
you you develop people to be their best? I think one of the biggest things that a lot of times we

189
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:11,200
forget is, this is a people business. At the end of the day, you know, ownership, people, coaches,

190
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,220
players, people, front office, you know, support staff, people, fans are people. We're in a people

191
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,500
business. And in order to get the best out of people, I believe you need to build relationships,

192
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,200
need to build equity, and people need to understand that you're invested. I think you

193
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,740
always can get the best out of someone when they feel you're invested in them. I joke a lot of times

194
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:43,279
that people confuse two words that are usually used interchangeably, as far as people talk about

195
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,360
managing and people talk about leading. Well, you manage a process, you manage a project,

196
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,559
you lead people, you try to influence and inspire people, motivate people,

197
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:01,559
and I think that's something that for me, at the end of the day, is my focus. If I'm dealing with

198
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,960
players, if I'm dealing with other staff, the people who have been invested in my career

199
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,539
have always made me be the best I am. So I try to be invested in others.

200
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:23,399
We all are born different. As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks

201
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,679
uniquely our own.

202
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:34,620
Charting our life's course. No one sees an idea, opinion, or opportunity like you.

203
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:42,220
And no one sees you like VU, Victoria University. Uniquely you.

204
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:48,460
My name's Yanni, and I study a Bachelor of Sports and Exercise Science at VU. I come from a very

205
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,860
family-oriented, Greek culture. Comin' to VU I feel like I'm getting the same sort of community vibe,

206
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,580
After high school, I went straight into the workforce and I did this for about four years,

207
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,659
but then I felt like I want to follow my passion, which is sport.

208
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,940
VU is ranked number seven in the world for sport and exercise science.

209
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,299
So it was a no brainer for me.

210
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:18,470
And Jeff, I hear about a legendary work ethic that you've got and that comes with a bit

211
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,070
of cost.

212
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:24,210
I read, you know, for eight months of the year, every meal of the day is at work because

213
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,250
you have breakfast, lunch and dinner and you work through that, as you said, as a husband

214
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,350
and a father to your beautiful daughter.

215
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,009
How do you balance that work life balance?

216
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,750
I think it's obviously it's a challenge to balance for any of us.

217
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:49,649
I think any professionals have work constraints and balancing that with your family life is

218
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:49,909
hard.

219
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,190
But I do think, again, we approach.

220
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,990
As a family, as an opportunity, my wife and daughter are going to come down here and go

221
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,570
to the Super Bowl.

222
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,109
Like that's a that's an amazing experience that you probably just don't get.

223
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,750
So we try to lean into the experiences that you do get rather than focus on the time that

224
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,390
you don't have.

225
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,289
It requires a lot of work.

226
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,650
I think everybody, again, any professional who's, you know, kind of climbing the ladder

227
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,750
and going where they want to go, it's going to take work.

228
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,710
I've never been afraid of that.

229
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:33,890
My wife sometimes reminds me of that when we do have, you know, our break after in the

230
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,230
summer that she's like, you're not working like let's focus on other things.

231
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,769
But it's again, it's an opportunity.

232
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:49,210
My daughter comes down on the field pregame of every game.

233
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:52,609
I joke that she just thinks this is normal.

234
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,029
So, you know.

235
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,750
Those are the things that you get out of it.

236
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,829
And you try to focus on those positives that you get rather than focus on what you miss.

237
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,930
I also I couldn't do it without my wife.

238
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,809
My wife is the head of the head of the household.

239
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,450
She keeps things running.

240
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,990
She has a career in her own right.

241
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,049
And she's a former athlete as well.

242
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:22,910
So we we can definitely vibe on on that space.

243
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,170
But it's she.

244
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:35,130
She does a great job of keeping me grounded, keeping me focused and kind of keeping me locked in and allowing me to when it's time to go to work like to go.

245
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:42,130
We're literally heading towards 48 hours out from Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans.

246
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,869
Your opponents are chasing a three-peat, something that has never been done in the in the Super Bowl era.

247
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,809
Patrick Mahomes is going to be a legend of the sport.

248
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,710
They're quarterback.

249
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,190
You've got the Travis.

250
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:58,509
Kelsey Taylor Swift Super Bowl extravaganza happening again.

251
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:02,329
You can't imagine more global interest in this event.

252
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,250
It's the biggest event.

253
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,410
Anyway, does it feel that way to you that this is maybe bigger than it's ever been this Super Bowl?

254
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:15,890
I think it again, the biggest focus for us is really trying to just keep the same process.

255
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,390
Of course, everybody understands what it is.

256
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,470
This is a it's a big moment.

257
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,029
And a big opportunity.

258
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:30,670
But again, the focus is on keeping things consistent and just kind of focusing in.

259
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:36,910
It's a game just like the last game we played, you know, and at the end of the day, you're still going to roll out and play football.

260
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,430
And that's what we've got to do.

261
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:51,089
So I'm curious, just as we are so close from such an event and you keep talking about the process, but just to go into a little bit of detail, players are still going to have their tickets.

262
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,430
They've got to have their accommodation.

263
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,450
You're living away from home.

264
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,569
Their families are in town and they've got to be accommodated.

265
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,450
Their meal preparation's got to be the same.

266
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:04,950
I can only imagine the logistics that are on your schedule are enormous.

267
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,910
Can you tell us about the sort of detail that you need to get right in the next couple of days?

268
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:13,750
I really think like organizationally, we've done an amazing job.

269
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:22,630
This, we have some of the best people in the world who are, have set things up and make it so that.

270
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,130
Players and coaches can focus on what they need to do.

271
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:38,690
I think that's all a part of this is really the biggest focus of anyone is to make it so that the players and coaches can really just lock in on what they need to do.

272
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:45,990
So we have an amazing staff who's helped with tickets and dealing with friends and family issues.

273
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:53,170
You know, our nutrition staff who's helping you get all the meals are training staff.

274
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:53,430
Who's.

275
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:01,130
Who's keeping things as, as normal as possible to make sure guys are, you know, have whatever they need to be able to get ready.

276
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:14,690
It's a, it's a big undertaking, but I think that's part of what you understand and being in a, in a really top down, excellent organization is that everybody has to work together.

277
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,990
Everybody has to be on the same page.

278
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:23,329
And at the end of the day, if we all do our jobs, then it can make it as easy as possible for the.

279
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,569
The rest of the group to function, normal and normal process.

280
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:40,670
I have to ask you about a giant Australian from Western Sydney and three centimeters, six foot eight in the old 166 kilos or 365 pounds, a giant of a man.

281
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,329
Jordan Maylato is hoping to make some history from an Australian perspective.

282
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:50,450
Tell us about him as a character and a teammate and how big a role has he got to play?

283
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,910
Jordan is an.

284
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,029
Unbelievable human being.

285
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,029
We joke about it, that he, he's enormous.

286
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,250
He's athletic.

287
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,690
He can sing.

288
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,210
He's a great, like just personality.

289
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:15,109
Jordan really has really been a huge bright spot for us.

290
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,190
And it's, I know, obviously him being from Australia.

291
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,450
That's a, that's a big thing.

292
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,509
Matt, Matt jokes about it, uh, with me, uh, but he is an awesome player.

293
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:31,109
Um, he's an awesome leader, but he's an awesome person.

294
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:38,869
Um, and I think he's done a very good job this year of really stepping in and being a heck of a leader for us.

295
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,349
Um, so we're excited.

296
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,529
Um, and I think, you know, if he does, you know, what he's been doing all year, we'll be in a great shape.

297
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,369
I know you're focused on the detail, but yeah, obviously.

298
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:56,029
And what wonders too, it's great success of what it could mean.

299
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:04,569
And can you give us an insight into how special, you know, that would be for, for not only you, but the wider team and the wider community that support the Eagles?

300
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:13,809
Yeah, I think, uh, we all, you know, everybody who gets in this business, you're not getting in it to not win a soup.

301
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,450
Like that's the goal of everybody.

302
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:22,289
Um, it's the ultimate goal, but at the end, again, we try to go piece by piece and focus on today.

303
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:22,430
It's the ultimate goal, but at the end, you know, we try to go piece by piece and focus on today.

304
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:28,009
Rather than, you know, looking so far ahead, but, um, it's, it's amazing.

305
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,250
Uh, the opportunity, um, we have in front of us is, is awesome.

306
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,190
And it would mean a heck of a lot to everybody in here.

307
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,529
It would mean a heck of a lot to all of our fans.

308
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:45,569
Um, like I said, our coaches, our executives, our support staff, our players ownership.

309
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:51,049
Uh, it's, it's a heck of an accomplishment and it's something that's not promised.

310
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:57,650
it's you know very hard to to get to this moment and it would definitely mean a lot but again the

311
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:04,150
the it's great to look at that but you know the focus is just kind of keeping it normal

312
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,750
and not thinking about what's coming next but thinking about what's right in front of you

313
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:15,569
Jeff you've got a great reputation as a leader of people and a great connector of people in

314
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:21,269
everything you do and it's been great to spend some time with you and in the week that is Super

315
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,829
Bowl 59 in your role it's incredibly generous for you to take some time final question to you

316
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:32,730
who's been the greatest leader in your life? Luke obviously you know I've listened to the

317
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:39,890
podcast a little bit so I knew this one was coming and I mentioned my father earlier

318
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,549
I think he's one that was so influential to me

319
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:53,210
and one of the things that I'll never forget you know people said my father passed when I was in

320
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:01,230
college and people talked about him being able to walk with kings but keep the common touch

321
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:08,970
and my father always listened he was all he was as cerebral as he could possibly be which

322
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,730
sometimes would frustrate people when you know they're trying to go back and forth with him

323
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,529
but he listened he was

324
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:25,190
cerebral he was measured and it's something that I strive to do when I when I'm approached with

325
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,970
anything I really want to listen I think the best leaders and listen at the end of the day you can't

326
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,390
fix a problem that you don't know is there so you have to listen to people to be able to understand

327
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:44,890
what problems are are on the horizon being cerebral is you know a skill we are in a high pressure

328
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:50,690
environment I think you know a lot of people in sport are and you have to kind of never get too

329
00:25:50,690 --> 00:26:00,029
high never get too low um so just seeing those things and growing up around that has been awesome

330
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:08,329
for me um I reflect on it all the time I try my best to uh emulate him I I I'm not as cerebral as

331
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:15,210
he is I'm probably a little bit more fiery but um I try my best and it's something that has really

332
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:22,769
meant a lot to me um as far as you know my football career I think you know here I I spoke about him

333
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:30,910
earlier Howie Roseman is a an unbelievable unbelievable general manager um he consistently

334
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:39,569
is on the forefront of things pushing us kind of never being complacent one um a guy who's not

335
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:45,190
afraid to go outside of his comfort zone and and find the answers wherever they may be

336
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:53,109
we have people from you know from Wall Street to Broadway who are all um in our staff and

337
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:58,890
those differing opinions and differing backgrounds all really help us kind of to

338
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:07,210
move forward so um learning from him and him being a leader for us here uh early in my career

339
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:15,130
Mike Shanahan really was an unbelievable leader he he set the tone for you know for my career

340
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,450
we uh obviously you know you've had Matt on the podcast before and we were in Washington together

341
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:28,410
and I know Sean's in a group uh as well Sean McVay so we were all in Washington together and

342
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:35,769
and Coach Shanahan really set the course and kind of set the tone um early in my career about how

343
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:44,289
to approach things how to work um really how to focus in uh and he was so like he was really

344
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,190
really good to his players and he was really good to his players and he was really good to his

345
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:51,450
people um and that's something that's never left me so for me that's something that I try to focus

346
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,690
on because again it's a people business you can never forget that you have to build relationships

347
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,930
you have to people have to think you're invested in them um to get the best out of them so um

348
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:08,869
those would be probably the I know I said three but that's probably where I'd go

349
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:13,769
well Jeff I think people get a great insight into how well placed the Eagles are heading into

350
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,190
the biggest event in the world and I think that's a really good point

351
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:15,710
I think that's a really good point

352
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,829
as we've described many times having your steady hand and your relationships and the way you

353
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:25,549
connect with people is uh is a great template for the team this weekend we wish you all the best

354
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:29,329
thank you it's been a great pleasure to spend some time with you Jeff and thanks so much for

355
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:33,049
sharing some of your wisdom thank you thank you I appreciate it
