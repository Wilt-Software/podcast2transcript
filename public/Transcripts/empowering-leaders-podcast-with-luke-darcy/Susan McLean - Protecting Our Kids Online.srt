00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,810
Susan McLean is Australia's foremost expert in the area of cyber safety.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,810
Formerly a Victoria police officer for 27 years,

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,390
Susan took her first report of cyberbullying

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,170
involving a group of Year 8 schoolgirls back in 1994.

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,730
She's internationally respected for her research and expertise

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,890
and in Australia speaks to more than 250,000 students

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,469
in 300 schools each year.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,989
Susan's passion is to educate young people and parents

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,049
about the realities of the online world

10
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,070
so they can minimise risk to the point

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,549
where it doesn't have to be a dangerous place.

12
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:38,649
Susan, good to see you again.

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,270
Thanks for your time.

14
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,649
Thanks very much for having me.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,310
I feel we need to start.

16
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,590
This has been recorded a few days after a horrific police tragedy

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,490
in Queensland and your community has had, you know,

18
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:56,530
an act of complete terrorism effectively perpetrated against them.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,670
You know, we're feeling for you.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,009
I think it's moments like these that we really do understand

21
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,350
the dangers of policing.

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,329
It must be a terrible time for you and your community.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,430
It is and, you know, I'm a former police officer now

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,209
but once you wear the blue, you're always part of that police family

25
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,269
and it does hit hard and especially a job like these members were sent to

26
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,250
because we've all done them.

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,069
Like, this wasn't a unique situation.

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,569
It wasn't out of the blue.

29
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,890
It wasn't an odd job.

30
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:25,189
It was a very common job and there would hardly be a police officer

31
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:28,450
anywhere in Australia that has not done a wellbeing

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,609
and missing persons check.

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,870
And a young female officer, you know,

34
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,969
eight weeks out of the academy, ambushed and murdered.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,750
It's just a terrible story.

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:45,930
Yeah, it defies any sort of ability to comprehend the harm, the anger.

37
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,209
You know, it wasn't just an unfortunate situation.

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,209
They were murdered and they were butchered and executed

39
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,730
and you can't say it in a polite way.

40
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,750
And, you know, there are more good people in the world than bad

41
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,849
but, my God, it was a tough time.

42
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:02,170
It was a tough day.

43
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,670
Yeah, Susan, I hope, you know, we're all genuinely feeling

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,110
and respectful for what the police community do

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,210
and didn't feel like we could start without that.

46
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,750
It is a big change of gear to move on to the world

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,270
that has become your world.

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,689
And my sense is that as parents, trying to get our kids off their screens,

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,389
social media, the internet, whatever it is,

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,009
and we know it's the world we live in now,

51
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,810
but, Susan, it's probably the number one thing we talk about as parents.

52
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,330
How do we do all that in a balanced way?

53
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,129
With difficulty.

54
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,830
Like, parenting is a tough gig.

55
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,949
It's the best gig in the world, of course, but it's not easy.

56
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,349
And just when you think you get on top of one thing,

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,669
something else comes along.

58
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,849
And screens are a huge issue at the moment.

59
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,289
They are manageable.

60
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,229
The benefits are enormous.

61
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,930
So, you know, we can't demonise it.

62
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,469
But it's always really important to understand that every time your child,

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,389
and yourself for that matter, uses technology, there's a risk.

64
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,729
But being able to identify that risk, minimise and manage it,

65
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,310
as you said it,

66
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,250
is the key.

67
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,650
And we want it to be balanced.

68
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,430
Like, we don't want young people to be, or adults,

69
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,810
you know, sitting down with their head in a screen for long periods of time.

70
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,689
There's a whole range of issues for that.

71
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,349
Yeah, and it's interesting you say that, Susan.

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,349
I hear that word a lot, and I've been trying to,

73
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,210
in my own parenting world, as you say,

74
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,030
if you demonise it, the kids just look at you like you've got two heads

75
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,009
because it's part of their world and, you know, you get emotional.

76
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,349
And it's an important part of their world.

77
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:27,889
And you're right.

78
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:29,270
There's enormous benefit, isn't there?

79
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,169
I love seeing how well they connect

80
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,710
and how well they organise themselves

81
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,090
and how well they communicate.

82
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,629
The best part, if you try to ignore that,

83
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,069
we're not living in the real world either, are we?

84
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,849
No, and we need to, for me, it's about, you know,

85
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,389
focusing on the benefits of technology,

86
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,949
but being mindful of the negatives.

87
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,729
So we don't want the negatives to overtake,

88
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,169
but it requires effort.

89
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,569
It's not going to magically happen.

90
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,250
A lot of parents will say, oh, but my kid is much better than me.

91
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,009
They know it all.

92
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,969
No, no, they don't.

93
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,830
They can use tech better than you,

94
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,710
because I laugh at this concept of tech being intuitive.

95
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,949
It's not intuitive when you're an old person

96
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,270
because you've got to learn it.

97
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,370
And it's like, I don't even understand what I'm doing here.

98
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,889
And you watch a really young person pick up tech

99
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:13,849
and they know what to do.

100
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:14,810
They've never had a lesson,

101
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,810
but it is intuitive for young people, not old people.

102
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,709
But what they don't have is that level of brain development.

103
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,069
So we know that that's lacking.

104
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,089
So there's a gap between what they can do

105
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,089
and what they have the capacity to understand.

106
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,629
And that's where parents come in.

107
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,529
You've got to be,

108
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,170
the brain power, not the tech support, the brain power.

109
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,870
Which in reality is what you have to do

110
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,129
in every other area of parenting as well, isn't it?

111
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,870
This one just seems to have a bit more complexity.

112
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,449
Can I talk about some of the numbers?

113
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,870
So the eSafety Commissioner says 44% of Australian young people

114
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,149
report having a negative online experience in the last six months.

115
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,930
So that can be online bullying,

116
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,870
exposure to inappropriate content, harassment, identity theft.

117
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,990
There are a huge range of issues out there to deal with.

118
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,589
There are.

119
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,089
And in my experience,

120
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,610
those numbers are quite low.

121
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,730
I would put it at probably closer to 70%.

122
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,589
Remembering a couple of things.

123
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,310
One, it's only based on reports to the eSafety Commissioner.

124
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,750
So not everything goes there.

125
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,389
And secondly, a lot of times this doesn't get reported anywhere

126
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,709
or it's reported somewhere where it's not captured in statistics.

127
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,629
So suffice to say, it is a huge issue.

128
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,149
It's multifaceted.

129
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,410
There's lots of different things that we need to be aware of.

130
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,569
But again, if we educate ourselves and we get on top of it,

131
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:28,670
we will be able to do a lot of things.

132
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,930
So that's one of the things that we need to be aware of.

133
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,050
So that's one of the things that we need to be aware of.

134
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,069
So that's one of the things that we need to be aware of.

135
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,009
We will reap the rewards.

136
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,209
I was in preparation for this,

137
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,689
so thinking about your world,

138
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,350
and I was watching a little boy walk up my street.

139
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,430
It was probably his last day of school.

140
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,649
He had to be five or six.

141
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,649
And I was watching him on his phone.

142
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,810
And he's head down,

143
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,370
he crossed all the driveways,

144
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,990
crossed a couple of street corners.

145
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:50,569
And the parenting hat kicks in,

146
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,410
you think he's a huge chance to get collected by.

147
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
Miracle that he wasn't.

148
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,250
So I went to the end of my street.

149
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,709
I thought I'm going to walk down and firstly make sure that,

150
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,050
you know,

151
00:05:59,069 --> 00:05:59,730
he's okay.

152
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:04,490
He would have not even have understood that I was even walking past him.

153
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,310
And I managed to sort of glance at his screen.

154
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,610
He was scrolling through TikTok and you could just see it head down,

155
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,269
not even aware of anything.

156
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:13,850
No spatial awareness.

157
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,389
No spatial awareness at all.

158
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,089
And I thought,

159
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,290
God,

160
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:21,089
that algorithm is so sophisticated and so intoxicating for a young kid.

161
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,649
It's very hard to manage,

162
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:22,970
isn't it?

163
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,509
It is.

164
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,910
And I think the other issue too is what parents see and experience

165
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,589
online is not going to be what their children see and experience because of

166
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,209
the algorithms.

167
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,449
Different stuff is pumped differently to each demographic,

168
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,430
each individual user for that matter.

169
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,410
And,

170
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:39,709
you know,

171
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,529
it is a concern.

172
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,110
And a lot of parents will say to me,

173
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,250
oh,

174
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,949
their child has to have a phone to keep them safe.

175
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,350
Phones don't keep kids safe.

176
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,529
Perfect example of the fact that that kid could easily have been barreled by a

177
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:51,970
car that he would not have even seen.

178
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,110
If he's walking along,

179
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,810
scrolling on a phone,

180
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,170
well,

181
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,470
you're setting yourself up to be robbed.

182
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,829
And your phone's stolen.

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,350
I think parents need to understand that phones can be handy and they can be

184
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,689
helpful,

185
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,269
but they do not keep children safe.

186
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,850
Far from it.

187
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,569
So the argument,

188
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:08,829
Susan,

189
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,649
will be in our own household,

190
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,050
it gets to an age where they're catching a train.

191
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,350
We want them to be able to ring in the event something does happen.

192
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,750
So that's when you need a phone because of the circumstances.

193
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,110
A five-year-old is not catching a train to school on their own.

194
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,050
So there's a difference.

195
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:23,829
And yes,

196
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,689
I always say you start to consider it for high school because they're on public

197
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,189
transport.

198
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,910
After school activities,

199
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,810
sport training,

200
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:31,870
I've missed the bus,

201
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,009
sport training's been canceled.

202
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,269
Come get me helpful and handy.

203
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,769
But if you think about it this way,

204
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,029
if your child's walking along and you know,

205
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,129
some random bad person is going to grab them,

206
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,149
what are they going to say?

207
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:42,689
Hang on a minute,

208
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:43,250
bad person.

209
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,149
Can you wait till I get my safety phone out of my bag and just ring mom before

210
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:47,810
you attack me?

211
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:48,790
All right.

212
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,209
It's not going to work that way.

213
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,170
Helpful,

214
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,970
handy.

215
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,910
Absolutely.

216
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:53,569
Um,

217
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,250
but they're not going to stop things.

218
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,310
And often,

219
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:56,569
you know,

220
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,990
please understand that when you give,

221
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,009
a device to a child,

222
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,209
you are giving your child to the world and the world to your child,

223
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,610
every single person in it,

224
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,529
all those people you are trying to protect them from use the internet as well.

225
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,490
You just can't see them.

226
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,230
So do you think we look back,

227
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,649
uh,

228
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:10,829
so,

229
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:11,509
and I know,

230
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:11,910
you know,

231
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,370
your view,

232
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,790
as you said,

233
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,250
the start,

234
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,829
we've got to take the good with the bad here.

235
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,209
And your,

236
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,509
your mission is about education so that you can have a positive experience and

237
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,209
on a negative one.

238
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,129
But do you think,

239
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:20,730
you know,

240
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,649
Apple has become one of the biggest companies in the world and the creation

241
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,949
of the iPhone and Steve Jobs' legacy.

242
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,569
Do you think there'll be a point?

243
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:27,990
We look back,

244
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,990
and think that may be the great curse of the 21st century.

245
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:31,750
Look,

246
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,269
I think if you speak to adolescent and child psychologist,

247
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,169
if you speak to many,

248
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:37,470
you know,

249
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,909
wellbeing coordinators at schools who continually see the negative impact of

250
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,730
tech,

251
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,610
there will be conversations about,

252
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,029
you know,

253
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,450
this generation of young people being Guinea pigs for the future.

254
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:53,190
If I look at going back to when I took that first report of cyber bullying,

255
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,049
the technology then versus today,

256
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,490
polar opposite,

257
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,629
like in those days,

258
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,789
there were listservs,

259
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,870
bulletin boards and chat rooms.

260
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,409
That was it.

261
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,409
Like there was nothing that we have today.

262
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,750
What we've seen though is yes,

263
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,649
technology has come across in leaps and bounds and for lots of lots of beneficial reasons,

264
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,190
but the safety aspect of it hasn't kept up.

265
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:21,450
And what I get to see often is a new app gets invented and everyone jumps on board because of whatever reason,

266
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,070
and then safety becomes an afterthought and we've got to switch that thinking to make it,

267
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,370
you know,

268
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,970
safety first,

269
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,429
second and third embedded in the app,

270
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:30,730
not,

271
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,809
you know,

272
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:32,649
adding it on at the end.

273
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,750
Cause if you add something on to any product,

274
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:35,230
you know,

275
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,450
it's never going to be as good as if it's embedded in it.

276
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,169
Yeah.

277
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,070
It's a great point you make,

278
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,370
isn't it?

279
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,070
And I think app makers are about growing their audience,

280
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,870
not about safety first.

281
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,029
And you can sort of understand the commercial world of that.

282
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,110
Last time I saw you,

283
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,950
I was fascinated.

284
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,269
You know,

285
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,110
I had this conversation with you that the world of the online troll,

286
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,370
you know,

287
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,750
from racial,

288
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:53,809
misogynistic,

289
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:54,669
homophobic,

290
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:55,690
uh,

291
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:55,990
you know,

292
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,350
the trash that we see on the online,

293
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,549
I had this perception that it was incredibly difficult to track those people down.

294
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,149
The big tech companies protected them because of privacy laws.

295
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,309
You told me that's a hundred percent not true.

296
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,809
Can you explain?

297
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,169
Yeah.

298
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,049
And that's correct.

299
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,710
And what we know is,

300
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,850
look,

301
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:15,250
some platforms don't work cooperatively with police or it's,

302
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:16,649
they make it very difficult,

303
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,429
especially for countries that are not where the,

304
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,789
um,

305
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:21,970
the platform is based.

306
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,950
So a lot of times,

307
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,429
um,

308
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,070
for some of the lesser platforms,

309
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,350
it is an effort.

310
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,129
To get that data because it like,

311
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,809
for example,

312
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,389
if it was reported to Victoria place,

313
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,409
so Victoria place have to get a warrant,

314
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,169
a state warrant.

315
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,149
It has to get converted to a Commonwealth board.

316
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:38,610
Then it gets conferred,

317
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,909
converted to what's called a,

318
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,230
an M lat treaty,

319
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,730
which is an international warrant.

320
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,649
Then it gets served on the company.

321
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:45,809
And by this stage,

322
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:46,029
you know,

323
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:46,830
it's complex.

324
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,769
It's complex.

325
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:49,389
On what sort of platform is that?

326
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:49,690
I mean,

327
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:49,929
well,

328
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:50,590
that's the,

329
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,269
the lesser known ones and the ones that really don't have a brand to protect if you like.

330
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,710
Right.

331
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,309
So what you'll find is like,

332
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,669
the meta platforms,

333
00:10:58,669 --> 00:10:59,549
Snapchat,

334
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,090
they will allow,

335
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:01,870
um,

336
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,330
a legal letter for want of a better word.

337
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,629
So this is a legally obtained document.

338
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:08,590
It'll be signed by,

339
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:09,730
by a judge to say,

340
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,870
this is the information we'd like,

341
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,389
and they will accept that.

342
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,049
So you don't have to go through the M lat process.

343
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,730
You might need to go through that process for certain pieces of information,

344
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,870
but basic,

345
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,230
um,

346
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,789
user identification,

347
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,789
you do not need to go that down that path.

348
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,190
So that's really good.

349
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,950
Um,

350
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,509
what we need though,

351
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,529
and if we think about,

352
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,029
you know,

353
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,250
cyberbullying and all forms of online abuse are a crime,

354
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:37,450
they're a crime throughout Australia under state law and Commonwealth law.

355
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,730
And if we think about what laws are meant to do,

356
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,149
they're meant to set the standard for acceptable behavior,

357
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,250
punish people that break the law,

358
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,809
but they're meant to provide a deterrent effect.

359
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:47,309
So,

360
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,549
you know,

361
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:51,009
if you're tempted to go and do the wrong thing and you see last week,

362
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,129
Billy or Mary have been sent to jail for doing the same thing.

363
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,629
Well then hopefully you might go,

364
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:55,990
Oh,

365
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,490
you know what?

366
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,570
I don't want to go to jail.

367
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,889
So I won't do that.

368
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:02,970
We're not seeing that with online crimes to the degree we should,

369
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,509
because so many people do not report it.

370
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:07,529
All right.

371
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,029
And they don't take it to the police.

372
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,909
So unless you are prepared to take that step,

373
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,750
then we're never going to get to that point where people see that,

374
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,909
well,

375
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,669
actually it is a crime and there are serious consequences if I choose this path.

376
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,490
So this is something I'm really passionate about.

377
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,669
So,

378
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,490
and I'm glad you explained that as clear as you did.

379
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,470
So we see that in the,

380
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,370
in the sporting world,

381
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,210
a lot.

382
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,309
And I know you've done a lot of work in,

383
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,129
in Sporting Codes,

384
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:30,629
the AFL,

385
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:33,330
Netball Australia around this work that you do,

386
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,129
but we'll say racist comment,

387
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,549
horrific thing said against an indigenous player or,

388
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,029
you know,

389
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,590
something horrific said to someone.

390
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,129
I mean,

391
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:41,669
for me,

392
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,769
what we want to do is exactly that.

393
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,149
We want to try and make an example of that behaviour and say that is

394
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:48,750
unacceptable.

395
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,009
It's not the standards we live up to.

396
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,070
And an example is not cancelling their club membership.

397
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,269
That's not an example.

398
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,470
So what would you do then?

399
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:55,710
So,

400
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,309
and my advice has always been to the clubs when I go into

401
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,389
them and this is for anyone,

402
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:01,950
you know,

403
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
you're going to cop some abuse,

404
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,409
you know,

405
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,029
is it fair?

406
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:05,250
No,

407
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,730
it's not,

408
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,529
but you know,

409
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:08,610
you're a peanut cause you missed a goal.

410
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,090
I mean,

411
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,110
you're going to have to suck that up,

412
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,289
but when it's targeted abuse,

413
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,769
you know,

414
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,090
really personal targeted,

415
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,990
I'm going to rape your wife,

416
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,529
for example,

417
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,289
as a common one,

418
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,389
the racist,

419
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:19,230
the homophobic,

420
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,830
et cetera.

421
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,950
That's not okay.

422
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,669
That that's not,

423
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:22,149
you know,

424
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,509
something you should accept as part and parcel of who you

425
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:24,769
are.

426
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,429
So until such time as we can make,

427
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,090
not make,

428
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,509
but encourage players to come forward and make that police

429
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:33,009
report,

430
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,370
nothing will change.

431
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,169
And it's all very well.

432
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,669
Media articles,

433
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,870
no media articles are great.

434
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,169
You know,

435
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,850
Billy got racially abused this week.

436
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,330
Great.

437
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,110
But the offender is still out there keeping on keeping

438
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,610
on.

439
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,070
And we have to encourage that reporting because that's where

440
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,070
we're going to make a difference and change the thought process.

441
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,110
Can I ask you a pointed question then as a,

442
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,730
as a,

443
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:55,190
you know,

444
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,149
nearly 30 year police officer,

445
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,509
are you going to get a good reception?

446
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:00,649
You know,

447
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,450
I feel play you're walking in to say,

448
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:02,690
you know,

449
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,990
someone seriously threatened me.

450
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,330
Is that process one that encourages people to do that?

451
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,350
Well,

452
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,090
we could call it postcode lottery,

453
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,009
which is a really sad thing to say,

454
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:18,169
but it's real in that it does often depend on who

455
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:18,830
you speak to.

456
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,570
But you know,

457
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:21,230
I,

458
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,830
I,

459
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,169
the player is not going to rock up to the PlayStation on

460
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:24,509
their own.

461
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,590
The player development manager for the club would go with them.

462
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,029
The player's manager that they'd be fronting up and going high.

463
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,210
This is the situation.

464
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,110
And I think in that regard,

465
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:40,009
an AFL player has far more chance of having something investigated

466
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,009
than Mr.

467
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:41,269
And Mrs.

468
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:41,690
Citizen.

469
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,029
And there was a case,

470
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,029
and I think it was a Richmond plan not that long ago where threats

471
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:46,610
had been made,

472
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,210
you know,

473
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,850
to rape his wife or something like that.

474
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,049
And he went to the police and the people got arrested and charged.

475
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,669
Now,

476
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,690
did they get a penalty that,

477
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,409
that I would have given?

478
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,210
Probably not,

479
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,309
but there was a penalty and you know,

480
00:14:59,690 --> 00:14:59,929
we,

481
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:03,029
we need to do more of that because it's doable and it's

482
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,549
possible and no person,

483
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,690
let alone an AFL player or anyone in between should have to

484
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,470
tolerate that.

485
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,149
And this is all about leadership,

486
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:12,870
this podcast.

487
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,149
And I,

488
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:13,870
and I think it's a,

489
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,690
it's a massive opportunity for a leadership position to be

490
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,850
taken from police,

491
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,230
from high profile people,

492
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,129
from average people.

493
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,549
I mean,

494
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,309
as you said to me last time I saw you,

495
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,570
if you're at the front of your house and someone walked

496
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,809
past and said something as horrific as that,

497
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,389
I'm going to write you,

498
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,070
or I mean,

499
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,110
you know,

500
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
I know exactly what my reaction is.

501
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,210
Oh,

502
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,690
thanks.

503
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,450
See you later.

504
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,690
Appreciate your feedback.

505
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,769
You're going to get police involved.

506
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,149
You're going to react yourself.

507
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,230
Um,

508
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,169
but you know,

509
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:42,750
that happens thousands of times an hour online and it's

510
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,370
getting through.

511
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,330
And that's to me,

512
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,190
creating a huge issue with where we're at in society.

513
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,889
If we look currently at that amazing young man,

514
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,330
that's been drafted to North Melbourne,

515
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,169
the Jewish player and the amount.

516
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:59,049
And the amount of abuse that he's copying and his family.

517
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,350
And what do we have bleeding hard articles in the paper?

518
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,289
You know,

519
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,570
it is a big ask for an 18 year old who has just

520
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,690
been drafted to trot off to the police station.

521
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:08,389
However,

522
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:09,769
I would expect his manager,

523
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,350
the club,

524
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,450
the player development manager,

525
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,009
whoever is looking after him,

526
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,950
the AFL to be going,

527
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,769
hang on a minute.

528
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,429
It's all very well getting these comments taken down.

529
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,129
All right.

530
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:19,549
Okay.

531
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:20,289
And what do they do?

532
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,169
It happens again.

533
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,330
You know,

534
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,129
someone somewhere along the journey,

535
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:28,330
has to take a stand and not an isolated player because the,

536
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,889
the Richmond one would have to have been two or three years ago.

537
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,789
Now I can't tell you another case that I am aware of where a

538
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,590
player has actually gone and lodged a complaint.

539
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,970
And if it is racist,

540
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:39,610
racist,

541
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,210
homophobic,

542
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,809
et cetera,

543
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,169
not only is that under cyber bullying laws,

544
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,389
it's a breach of the discrimination act.

545
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:47,830
And for example,

546
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,090
let's say Harry got 50 racist messages,

547
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,509
right?

548
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,110
The perpetrator,

549
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:54,629
well,

550
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:59,129
it's like the one person that sent the 50 that perpetrator would face 150

551
00:16:59,129 --> 00:16:59,750
charges,

552
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,210
150,

553
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,549
50 state cyber bullying charges,

554
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:05,289
50 Commonwealth cyber bullying charges,

555
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,329
and 50 discrimination act charges.

556
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,670
It's a powerful message to send,

557
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,009
isn't it?

558
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:10,509
So,

559
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,369
and I love your leadership in this space and tell me,

560
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,970
I'm all about accountability.

561
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,710
If you show people that you can get away with those things,

562
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,630
it encourages other people.

563
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,329
Of course it does.

564
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,289
Of course it does.

565
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,329
And you know,

566
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,410
we've been so slow.

567
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:23,690
What,

568
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,369
why is that?

569
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,509
To me it's a free hit,

570
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:25,910
you know?

571
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,369
I don't know.

572
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:28,849
You know,

573
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,349
if you look at any other type of offending,

574
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,990
I don't think it's as underreported other than sexual offending,

575
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,730
which we know is terribly underreported.

576
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,170
But other than that,

577
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,809
you know,

578
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,490
if a crime is committed against you,

579
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,130
you go to the place like that.

580
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,230
That's how it is.

581
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,049
Whether people think it's a free for all on the internet,

582
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,289
it doesn't matter whether they think that laws don't count out there.

583
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,150
But again,

584
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,670
it's often because I didn't know,

585
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,390
it was a crime because I don't ever see a consequence.

586
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,150
I don't see anyone arrested and charged for this.

587
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,849
So therefore it must be okay.

588
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,309
The platforms by and large,

589
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,190
the main ones work cooperatively with police,

590
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,750
even Snapchat.

591
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:09,650
All right.

592
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,509
The content disappears.

593
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,009
It does not delete.

594
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:14,690
All right.

595
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,109
And again,

596
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:15,369
people go,

597
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:15,490
Oh,

598
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,190
it's on Snapchat.

599
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,609
I know.

600
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:17,029
No,

601
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,150
no,

602
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,430
no.

603
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,950
It is always worth visiting the police station.

604
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:21,769
Um,

605
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:23,690
unfortunately,

606
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,369
sometimes you have to stand your ground and go,

607
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,369
I know this is a crime,

608
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,029
so I'm not leaving here until you take a report.

609
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:28,970
Shouldn't happen.

610
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,390
But you know,

611
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,809
we've got to do more to make it unacceptable.

612
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,430
It's all very well saying it's unacceptable,

613
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,109
but what are we doing to show it?

614
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,150
And Susan,

615
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,950
at the extreme end,

616
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:40,210
I mean,

617
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,549
that's horrific to deal with,

618
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:42,269
uh,

619
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,190
not under the estimating that any shape or mind,

620
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,529
but some other,

621
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:46,970
you know,

622
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,089
in preparation for this,

623
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:48,529
there's talk,

624
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:48,930
you know,

625
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,069
at any one time in the internet,

626
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,809
there's a million online predators,

627
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,849
online grooming,

628
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,289
sexual exploitation,

629
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,789
a whole range of really serious.

630
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,250
Is that from your experience,

631
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,369
what's happening at that end of the scale?

632
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:03,910
Yep.

633
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:09,029
So we know that the online exploitation of children is the fastest growing crime of its type in the world.

634
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,829
I still have parents tell me that,

635
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,109
that I worry about pedophiles because they're kids smart.

636
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:14,809
Well,

637
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:15,009
you know,

638
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,029
I'm sorry to burst your bubble,

639
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,569
but they're not that smart.

640
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,410
Um,

641
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,869
or I don't worry about pedophiles because my child would pick them.

642
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,089
No,

643
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:21,609
they won't.

644
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,730
That's why these people,

645
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,710
they're so good at what they do because they're not going to get picked.

646
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,910
They don't enter into a conversation with your child.

647
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,609
Hi,

648
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,849
I'm a child sex offender.

649
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,170
Do you want to hang out with me?

650
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:32,829
Right?

651
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,890
They're going to seem nice,

652
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,269
sound nice,

653
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,369
look nice and appear nice.

654
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,049
They will spin them a line.

655
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,109
And,

656
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,609
you know,

657
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,410
unfortunately for the 10 kids that don't take the bait,

658
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:43,670
number 11 and 12 will.

659
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,329
Right?

660
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:44,869
They don't care.

661
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,650
Like they'll just keep going until they get someone to engage with.

662
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,230
And it is a huge issue.

663
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:52,789
And I said recently at a parent,

664
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,490
evening that I would much rather if I had a 12 year old child,

665
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:01,049
I would much rather let them walk around the block at midnight on their own

666
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,410
than put them on the internet unsupervised because I know where the most

667
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,829
likelihood of harm is and it's not on my street at midnight.

668
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,529
That's a confronting thing to say,

669
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:11,930
isn't it?

670
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,069
Cause no parent I know was going to allow their 12 year old to walk around the

671
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:15,430
block,

672
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,869
but not all of us at one.

673
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,250
And I have to put my hand up.

674
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,430
I say this all the time because you know,

675
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,690
as a father of four and you're passionate about this space,

676
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,589
but you know,

677
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,430
I'm on my phone.

678
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,450
You can't be there 24 seven.

679
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:25,730
Yeah.

680
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,329
And also you're sort of hypocritical cause I'm on my phone too much.

681
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:32,230
And I'm yelling at young Maxie to get off his phone as I'm on the phone myself.

682
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,029
So I know the hypocrisy is alive and well.

683
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,130
It's like don't drink alcohol darling while I'm swigging a beer.

684
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,410
Well,

685
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,029
that's right.

686
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,250
I mean,

687
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,430
it's,

688
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,829
it's,

689
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:39,369
it's a complex parenting thing,

690
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:42,630
more complex than any I think we've we've seen.

691
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,730
I,

692
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,069
it certainly feels like an error.

693
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:44,869
Can I change tack?

694
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,349
We had a huge high profile hacking issue,

695
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:52,130
Medibank and the data being released to people's private health,

696
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,650
uh,

697
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,150
information,

698
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,089
horrific thing.

699
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:54,930
I mean,

700
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,789
how,

701
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,089
you know,

702
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,410
for people who run small businesses are listening to this people who,

703
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,029
you know,

704
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:00,750
in the past,

705
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,829
it was a Nigerian scammer.

706
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:02,670
And you thought I'm,

707
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,170
you know what,

708
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,349
I reckon I'll be okay.

709
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:04,869
Yeah.

710
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:08,589
Now it's very sophisticated and they're very good at what they do.

711
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,029
What should you do to protect yourself?

712
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,690
If you are running a business that has any tech,

713
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,029
um,

714
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,029
which it will cause at least have an email,

715
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,190
you need to understand that there is a risk.

716
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,970
Now,

717
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,529
where do you,

718
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,650
and I say this all the time,

719
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,750
where do you sit on the risk scale?

720
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,029
Like,

721
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:22,529
I can't,

722
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,150
I can't answer that because I don't know what you do,

723
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,049
how you do it.

724
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:26,309
I don't know how good you are,

725
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,529
what systems you have in place.

726
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:28,650
I don't know your knowledge.

727
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,650
And I don't know,

728
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,750
you know a lot about you,

729
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,769
whether you know you are attractive to Harry,

730
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,930
the hacker or you're not.

731
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,589
So all these things are important,

732
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:39,930
but I don't want people to think that now job's right because I'm X.

733
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,470
Therefore,

734
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,569
no one's going to bother me because a lot of this is nuisance value as well.

735
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:50,309
So they don't actually get anything out of it in a monetary way other than

736
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,910
they've stuffed you up.

737
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,910
The amount of people,

738
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,549
however,

739
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:56,410
that are willing to pay a ransom to allegedly,

740
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,650
you know,

741
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,109
get access to their database back does my head in.

742
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,369
And it's the one thing,

743
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:00,769
you know,

744
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:05,430
that I fully support a Medibank with is that the minute you pay a ransom,

745
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,549
you are telling the offender that you have a willingness to pay and a capacity

746
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:12,009
to pay the two things you don't want them to know.

747
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:12,730
So you never,

748
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,390
ever do that.

749
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,430
And you should never,

750
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,990
on any circumstances,

751
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,329
never,

752
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:16,690
ever,

753
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,289
ever,

754
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,069
ever.

755
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,029
So,

756
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,470
you know,

757
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,789
so any business owner is at risk.

758
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,089
Obviously some more than others.

759
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:23,490
Now,

760
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,589
if you look at the Optus and the Medibank and the things like that,

761
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:27,490
you know,

762
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,789
all that data,

763
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:29,490
well,

764
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,430
there's a debate with Optus about keeping it a bit longer than they legally

765
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,029
should have.

766
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:35,069
But the one thing that they all did,

767
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,970
it appears that they did wrong is that yes,

768
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,930
you're allowed to hold the data,

769
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,130
but it was meant to be encrypted.

770
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,089
So if you know,

771
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:40,450
Harry,

772
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,410
the hacker did get in,

773
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,390
it was useless to them because there was nothing there in a format that they

774
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,049
could use or Susan McLean,

775
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,029
the name is there,

776
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,789
but it doesn't,

777
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:52,630
it doesn't link to anything.

778
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,289
So,

779
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:53,789
you know,

780
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,210
you couldn't match it all up.

781
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,869
And that appears to be something that's lacking again,

782
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,109
unless there are consequences for that,

783
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:00,609
you know,

784
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,410
nothing is going to change.

785
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:02,910
And,

786
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,410
you know,

787
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,349
to the government's credit,

788
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:09,869
they have jumped fairly quickly to put in place some consequences for future

789
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:10,450
hacks,

790
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,549
which there will be.

791
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,170
You've only got to look at Telstra this week that inadvertently published

792
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,069
personal information of people that had asked for their number and their

793
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,390
address to remain silent.

794
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,569
And apparently it appeared in white pages directories.

795
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:27,009
Now to me,

796
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:27,609
yes,

797
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:32,170
if I had a complex medical history that I didn't really want known,

798
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,990
that would be distressing that that was on the dark web.

799
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,690
Will it ever make the light a day?

800
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,390
Might,

801
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:37,990
might not.

802
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:43,150
But if I was fleeing domestic violence or I was still a serving police

803
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,690
officer,

804
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,690
I most definitely do not want my name,

805
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,910
address and phone number out there for everyone to see,

806
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:50,589
because you know,

807
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:53,769
that's a personal safety issue and you know,

808
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,150
it's not going to go anywhere fast.

809
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,089
What can we do?

810
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,009
Not a lot because you've got to,

811
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,529
there has to be a level of trust in these organisations,

812
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,789
but they're failing us dismally at the moment.

813
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,509
And so you clearly understand this better than I do,

814
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:11,490
but the data gathering on us and our kids,

815
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:14,769
but you can't sign into your kids,

816
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,190
you know,

817
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,289
school function without giving you know,

818
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,529
your address and your phone number and 14 other points of information.

819
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,970
And you get to the point where I do certainly where you go,

820
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,490
it's so far gone.

821
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,829
Yeah.

822
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:29,950
I think though that I think people are now with these three are starting to

823
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,910
challenge a bit more like,

824
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,289
Hey,

825
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:34,109
why do you actually need this?

826
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:34,589
You know,

827
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,789
is it a function of your business or is it,

828
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:37,130
you know,

829
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,609
something extra school login systems that I'm not a fan of a lot of those,

830
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:43,210
because again,

831
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,450
they gather far too much information that is totally irrelevant and is not

832
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:46,990
necessary.

833
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,130
I sign into schools every day,

834
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,569
obviously I'm in schools and I got asked recently,

835
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,089
am I vaccinated?

836
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:52,210
Yeah,

837
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:52,869
it's not a problem.

838
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,450
Which brand of vaccination did I have?

839
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,069
Well,

840
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:57,549
I don't think so.

841
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:58,809
Like not that I care,

842
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,269
but,

843
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,150
but for what purpose are you gathering that?

844
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,829
So I think,

845
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:03,470
you know,

846
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,910
we do need to be very clear that if,

847
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,269
if someone is starting to ask questions or I'm expecting you to provide

848
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:12,490
information that you're thinking,

849
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:12,609
well,

850
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,130
hang on this,

851
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,890
this does not in any way relate to what I'm trying to do with you.

852
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,410
Then we need to be prepared to pull back and go,

853
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,009
well, hang on a minute.

854
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,009
Cause if everyone pulls back,

855
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:22,849
then things will change,

856
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,910
but it's when people accept it as,

857
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,150
oh,

858
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,589
well,

859
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:26,349
what can I do?

860
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,170
And if everyone takes that attitude,

861
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,710
it's just going to continue.

862
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,170
And it's the same as the cyber bullying.

863
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,369
If you put it in the too high basket and go,

864
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:33,789
you know what?

865
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,109
It can be someone else's problem.

866
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,029
Then nothing changes.

867
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,230
And I am forever,

868
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,029
you know,

869
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,049
reporting accounts on social media that I say that I know are inappropriate.

870
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:46,329
Now they're not targeting me particularly.

871
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:47,230
They might be,

872
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,289
they're often not they're targeting someone else.

873
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,470
I'll report them.

874
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,970
I have often multiple accounts a week deleted off social media,

875
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,750
simply on based on my report.

876
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,089
It takes all of 10 seconds.

877
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,349
So I'm not prepared to walk past that standard.

878
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:03,650
I'm going to act.

879
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,150
If it simply means click,

880
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,369
click,

881
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,690
click and send it off.

882
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:07,789
If the platform does nothing,

883
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,369
I can't do anything more at that point,

884
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,210
unless it's something I need to,

885
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,690
to deal with in a different way.

886
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,069
But I think if everyone did that again,

887
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:16,549
you know,

888
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:20,289
the AI behind the programs now are starting to block people from

889
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:20,349
saying,

890
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,890
setting up multiple accounts when their accounts have been deleted.

891
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,650
There's reporting options about blocking someone,

892
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,049
blocking an account plus any new count they create,

893
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,650
you know,

894
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,349
so we're,

895
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,750
we're,

896
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,089
you know,

897
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,089
five steps forward,

898
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,970
six steps back,

899
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,730
but we're getting there,

900
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,569
but it takes a groundswell of people going,

901
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,730
well,

902
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,230
hang on a minute.

903
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,109
This is not okay.

904
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,240
Now you're an old school,

905
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,720
you know,

906
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,759
hardened police officer.

907
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
It takes a bit to rattle you,

908
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
but you get more than your fair share,

909
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,640
of horrific abuse online and probably more than given you take such a powerful stance.

910
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:00,900
I mean,

911
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,200
does it,

912
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,359
does it ever get to you?

913
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,940
Yes and no.

914
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Like I just sort of think sad people in the world that think they need to,

915
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:07,960
this is,

916
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,880
these are people targeting me that don't even know me.

917
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,539
Right.

918
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,539
But I've come out and I've been vocal about,

919
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:12,859
you know,

920
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:17,240
something in the media or some other online abuse and you get,

921
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:17,680
you know,

922
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:18,200
well,

923
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,019
just don't read it or,

924
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,319
you know,

925
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,079
things like that.

926
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,799
I mean,

927
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,039
block is my friend,

928
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,119
block and report.

929
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,539
And it never,

930
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,859
never ceases to amaze me,

931
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,519
you know,

932
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,339
what,

933
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,140
what people will go you for and how they actually find you.

934
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,380
Like,

935
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,859
it's like,

936
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,480
clearly you're following me for,

937
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:35,779
for,

938
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,599
for a reason.

939
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,039
You know,

940
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,259
you want to go me online.

941
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,220
I'm not interested in that conversation.

942
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,319
And I look at my Facebook page,

943
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,000
which has a really nice community of 30,000 people.

944
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,140
And,

945
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,720
you know,

946
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,960
they're all there because they want information by and large.

947
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,220
And,

948
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,720
and it's a very respectful place,

949
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,039
but you get the odd person that,

950
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,700
you know,

951
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,019
comes up with stupid stuff.

952
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:55,279
Well,

953
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,380
they're not welcome.

954
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,519
And I make that very clear.

955
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,319
But one,

956
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,519
one thing that really distressed me,

957
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,140
it did distress me,

958
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,640
not greatly.

959
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,460
We got over it,

960
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,640
but my husband and I got caught up in Los Rambles in Barcelona with the terrorist attack.

961
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:18,099
So we were on Los Rambles when that happened and got ourselves safe back into a shop.

962
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,359
We put all the,

963
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,059
because shops in Europe have metal shutters.

964
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,839
So we put all the shutters down and we hid in the shop with a lot of other people.

965
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,039
And the minute that I saw that car flying past,

966
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,640
I knew it was,

967
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,960
I knew exactly what was happening.

968
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,819
It was a terrorist attack and we needed to get out of there.

969
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,700
And I put a thing out to say,

970
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:36,920
like,

971
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,900
I marked myself safe,

972
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,400
which is one of the good things you can do in an emergency situation on social media.

973
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,019
And you know,

974
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:44,519
the,

975
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,400
I was getting messages like shame,

976
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,720
they didn't get you,

977
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,279
you know,

978
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,099
they should have tried harder to kill you.

979
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,039
And I'm thinking,

980
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,019
I don't even know who you are.

981
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,500
Like,

982
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:53,720
you know,

983
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,319
if you get your jollies telling someone you wish they were dead,

984
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:56,400
you know, you're dead.

985
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,539
And I'm like,

986
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:56,779
you know,

987
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,539
I feel sorry for you and I'm not going to let that affect what I do.

988
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,039
Yeah.

989
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,700
It's horrific though,

990
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:01,940
isn't it?

991
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,400
I hear that and your mind just goes,

992
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,579
well,

993
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,500
what have we become?

994
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,519
And I just,

995
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:07,940
to me,

996
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,440
it's that accountability piece isn't it?

997
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,980
I love those,

998
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,299
you know,

999
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:16,059
sometimes those people are working sophisticated jobs and you find out that that's what they,

1000
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:16,640
you know,

1001
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,200
like to put out into the universe.

1002
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,440
What distresses me greatly when I work with young people is the amount of them,

1003
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,380
the amount of them that are told to go and kill themselves.

1004
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:24,859
Now,

1005
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,539
I think that is the most abhorrent thing you could do.

1006
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,720
Say to any other human being,

1007
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
whether you like them or not.

1008
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,180
And it's common.

1009
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,680
That happens a lot.

1010
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,039
It flows off.

1011
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,480
And I say it flows off their tongue.

1012
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,740
It's coming off their fingers.

1013
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,619
I am sent the most distressing messages and screenshots from parents about what do I do about this?

1014
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,519
My child has just been told to kill himself.

1015
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,160
And there was one recently where he was,

1016
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:47,720
you know,

1017
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,819
told to jump off a bridge.

1018
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,480
Um,

1019
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,680
and if he planned it right,

1020
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,500
a train could hit him at the same time.

1021
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,539
I've seen families that have been sent playlists to die.

1022
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:56,940
Bye.

1023
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:57,799
You know,

1024
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,180
you know,

1025
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,079
this is it.

1026
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,859
This is our society.

1027
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:03,140
And then you look at that,

1028
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,299
then you look at what happened in Queensland,

1029
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,359
you know,

1030
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,579
and you've got to think,

1031
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,079
you know,

1032
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,900
are these people heading towards that sort of behavior if they're starting in primary school,

1033
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,140
thinking it's okay to tell someone to go kill themselves and we read that it becomes acceptable.

1034
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,259
It comes normal.

1035
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,519
And as you said,

1036
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:23,859
that's,

1037
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:24,380
uh,

1038
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,680
you know,

1039
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,519
something you walk past is something you accept.

1040
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,039
Isn't it?

1041
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,299
It's a powerful message that you've got.

1042
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,299
I've got a handful of leadership questions I want to ask you,

1043
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,880
but just a quick one before we move on to that.

1044
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,079
Where do you sit on schools allowing kids to have their phones in a classroom?

1045
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,000
Um,

1046
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,140
it depends how much you want to pay me for that answer.

1047
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
So let's go back to,

1048
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,460
I think it's 2018.

1049
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,059
Dr.

1050
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:47,599
Michael Carr,

1051
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:47,900
Greg,

1052
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,740
the adolescent psychologist and myself,

1053
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:50,480
um,

1054
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,500
and Amanda third,

1055
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,180
who's an academic were employed by the New South Wales education department to,

1056
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,559
to conduct a review into what should this look like?

1057
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,680
What should we do?

1058
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,759
The risk,

1059
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,420
the benefit,

1060
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,019
the dangers,

1061
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:03,720
et cetera.

1062
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:08,660
Now I am a hundred percent for the banning phones in schools.

1063
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,900
Do not stop cyberbullying.

1064
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,539
They do not write in any way,

1065
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,019
shape or form,

1066
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,019
because we know most of the cyberbullying happens at night.

1067
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,779
But what our review found and we spoke to lots of young people,

1068
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:19,339
parents,

1069
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,660
educators themselves,

1070
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,059
especially schools that had started to limit the use of phones and not one person had,

1071
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,140
anything negative to say,

1072
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,559
not one of them best thing we ever did.

1073
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,460
More engagement from the students,

1074
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,000
less distraction,

1075
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,319
children engaging better in the playground,

1076
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:35,960
et cetera.

1077
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,299
So it's not about block,

1078
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:41,539
bad and take away because it can be useful.

1079
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,220
And there is certainly teacher directed learning.

1080
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,339
There is amazing apps on your phone that manage your blood sugar.

1081
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,440
So valid medical reasons,

1082
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,859
not I need to text mom at two o'clock in the afternoon,

1083
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:54,380
not that,

1084
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,559
but medical reasons.

1085
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,440
But the unsupervised go for your life use.

1086
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:00,259
No,

1087
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,799
no,

1088
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:00,980
no,

1089
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,299
no.

1090
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,960
For a variety of reasons.

1091
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:04,339
I laugh.

1092
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,660
Schools have big signs.

1093
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,640
All visitors must report to the office.

1094
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,059
Well,

1095
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:13,579
what about the 200 or the 2000 random strangers that are in your school ground through technology?

1096
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,380
I had a school a couple of years ago said,

1097
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:16,680
Oh,

1098
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,000
you know,

1099
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,940
we're dealing with kids filming Tik Tok videos in the toilets in uniform.

1100
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,400
We really don't know what to do.

1101
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,599
So my first question is,

1102
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,039
what is your phone policy?

1103
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,039
Oh,

1104
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:26,960
we don't have one.

1105
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,599
Well,

1106
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,819
how's that working out for you?

1107
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,859
Not very well.

1108
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,880
So it is about setting an acceptable standard.

1109
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,940
It is about also,

1110
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,359
you know,

1111
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,759
people talk about preparing children for the real world.

1112
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,599
There are plenty of occupations where you cannot fiddle on your phone for eight hours a day.

1113
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:42,039
You know,

1114
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,079
you'll check your phone when you arrive at work and you will not see it again until you finished your shift.

1115
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,880
So if we've allowed kids to fiddle all day,

1116
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,519
every day,

1117
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:50,720
well,

1118
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,000
that is setting them up for failure.

1119
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,019
There is the inappropriate content.

1120
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,039
There is a small amount of bullying and harassment.

1121
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,240
I've seen that happens during the school day.

1122
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,380
There is,

1123
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:58,720
you know,

1124
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:02,519
if my child is a student at school and some other kid brings up,

1125
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,039
you know,

1126
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,579
violent pornography on their phone and says,

1127
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:04,759
Hey,

1128
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,420
look at this,

1129
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,380
that's a breach of duty of care of the school to keep my child safe.

1130
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,319
So,

1131
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:10,960
um,

1132
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,799
I firmly believe that school should have clear and robust,

1133
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:14,940
robust policy.

1134
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,960
Policy only works when it's enforced like a law,

1135
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,779
but I have not been given any valid reasons anywhere by anyone that says kids should have unsupervised access to phones.

1136
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,740
So as I said,

1137
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,759
teacher directed learning,

1138
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,259
please bring your phone because that's a decision for a teacher,

1139
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:33,460
um,

1140
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,779
medical reasons.

1141
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,119
But other than that,

1142
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,420
bring them into school.

1143
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,079
They stay in the locker and they come out at the end of the school day.

1144
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:40,539
Oh,

1145
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:42,099
but we let them use them at lunchtime.

1146
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,240
So what are they doing?

1147
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,220
Or they can check them at their lockers.

1148
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,420
What are they accessing?

1149
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,380
Oh,

1150
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,039
I don't know.

1151
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,619
So there's a whole lot of legal issues here.

1152
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,160
And I think,

1153
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:51,880
you know,

1154
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,539
the majority of schools understand that,

1155
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:54,660
but there are still some that,

1156
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,220
you know,

1157
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,619
live by hope.

1158
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,079
You know,

1159
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,019
we expect our students to make a good choice.

1160
00:33:59,759 --> 00:33:59,920
All right,

1161
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,799
what planet are you on?

1162
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,240
Kids don't make good choices.

1163
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:02,720
They're children.

1164
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,220
They need guidance.

1165
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,220
They need,

1166
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:05,940
you know,

1167
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,680
someone to go,

1168
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,960
this is not a good idea and help them understand the why behind it.

1169
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,460
Well,

1170
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,739
that makes an enormous amount of sense.

1171
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,159
Susan,

1172
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,059
I love asking these questions because I see leadership in different spaces and you've got a really clear,

1173
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,619
you know,

1174
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,579
1994 when most of us were,

1175
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,019
you know,

1176
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,940
weren't born.

1177
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,840
Well,

1178
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,199
I certainly,

1179
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,519
I certainly was,

1180
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,980
but working out the internet or what it was going to be,

1181
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:28,420
you know,

1182
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:28,699
you had,

1183
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:28,940
you know,

1184
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:31,800
I thought the internet was a fad that we were going to get over.

1185
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,179
Seriously.

1186
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,500
Yeah.

1187
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:42,119
I still remember a close family friend of ours bought a computer for their children and we were invited around to see the computer.

1188
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
What year do you reckon that?

1189
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,360
That would have had to have been,

1190
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:45,619
well,

1191
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,820
it was before 94.

1192
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,340
It would have to have been in the late.

1193
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,059
No,

1194
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,760
it was,

1195
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,079
I would not have been.

1196
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,539
So in the seven,

1197
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,280
late seventies.

1198
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,599
Okay.

1199
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,539
And it was this boxy thing that really was not connected to the internet,

1200
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,860
but it was a computer.

1201
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,800
And,

1202
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,000
you know,

1203
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:03,519
there was things on the screen and you could play a game.

1204
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,559
And I looked at it and think,

1205
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:04,940
oh yeah,

1206
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:05,219
whatever.

1207
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,480
Like it didn't even interest me.

1208
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,699
And then when the internet,

1209
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,000
you know,

1210
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,179
oh,

1211
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:11,000
it's a bit of a fad or a fashion because of course the internet came from the ARPANET,

1212
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,579
which was the American military communication system.

1213
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,860
Again,

1214
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,619
it was like,

1215
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,039
nah,

1216
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
not interested,

1217
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,579
nothing to do with me.

1218
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:19,099
And,

1219
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:19,400
you know,

1220
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:19,780
now,

1221
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,820
now look where I am.

1222
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,760
We think how,

1223
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,119
you know,

1224
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,019
young Google,

1225
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:23,659
Facebook,

1226
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,920
it's not a lot,

1227
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,179
is it?

1228
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,820
It's not a long history for how big they are in our life.

1229
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,760
So we see these dimensions of leadership really common.

1230
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,780
So there's an indifferent settings,

1231
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,380
whether you've been an educator or running a social venture or a cyber safety expert like you.

1232
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:38,719
So I'll ask you some questions.

1233
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,000
I expand as much as you like,

1234
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,760
or as little as you like.

1235
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
We see most people start with a sense of self leadership before they can lead others.

1236
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,280
When I say that to you,

1237
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,719
what does it mean?

1238
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,639
It means that I have confidence in my own ability and I'm prepared to do what I want.

1239
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:58,159
I'm prepared to do what is right rather than what might be expected of me.

1240
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:09,179
I think that was instilled in me from a very young age through my parents that although they were never a hundred percent happy that I joined the police force,

1241
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,800
a very stupid,

1242
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,539
super proud,

1243
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,760
but I was still a little girl.

1244
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,000
And,

1245
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,480
you know,

1246
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,460
when I joined 5% of police officers were females.

1247
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,460
So it was not a female industry.

1248
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,760
Like it clearly isn't anymore.

1249
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,219
Still,

1250
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,619
you know,

1251
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,480
I was the first,

1252
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:26,639
first female ever gazetted to the Eltham police station.

1253
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,360
When I would go out on the van,

1254
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:29,920
they were,

1255
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,440
instead of saying that we're two up,

1256
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,820
we were one and one.

1257
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,000
No,

1258
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,019
no separate change rooms and toilets.

1259
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:38,500
Like it was a very different world.

1260
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,699
So it was again,

1261
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,579
the belief I had in myself that,

1262
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,360
that it was right and I needed to do it.

1263
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,920
And I suppose that was more evidence when I started to work in this space in the police force.

1264
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,820
So when I took that report,

1265
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,639
and I started to think,

1266
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:53,800
well,

1267
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,420
hang on a minute,

1268
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,260
you know,

1269
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,219
I had little children at that time.

1270
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,659
I was like,

1271
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:57,840
God,

1272
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,239
is this the world they're growing up in?

1273
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,739
I need to educate myself.

1274
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,480
So I was very lucky in that I was invited to America and I undertook training with the FBI.

1275
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:07,480
Um,

1276
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,960
I reviewed some of the programs,

1277
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,699
the Dallas police department were using,

1278
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,539
um,

1279
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:19,159
and I came back and I badgered and harassed Victoria police to give me a position to put into place my knowledge.

1280
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,420
Because at that point,

1281
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,440
what I wanted to do is make Victoria police a better place and share,

1282
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,260
all my learnings from the States over here so that we could,

1283
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,440
because they were ahead of us,

1284
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,059
you know,

1285
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,380
at the police stations in,

1286
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,079
in Victoria,

1287
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,780
you had a complaints book and,

1288
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,019
you know,

1289
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:33,300
you'd,

1290
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,679
it's like the book you've got there.

1291
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,639
You'd make a note,

1292
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,760
be aware that there's a hoon driver at this address,

1293
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,260
you know,

1294
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,619
so the next shift would come in and go,

1295
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:40,820
oh,

1296
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,639
I need to go there.

1297
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,440
Well,

1298
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,199
they were always using,

1299
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,940
they were already using technology to,

1300
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,000
to do that sort of stuff.

1301
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:46,179
So,

1302
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,440
you know,

1303
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,760
way ahead of what we were doing.

1304
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,860
And,

1305
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,480
you know,

1306
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,159
it was,

1307
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,380
it was hard getting listened to.

1308
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,940
I had one high ranking police officer say to my face,

1309
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,480
you are blonde and female.

1310
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,159
You don't have much going for you.

1311
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,659
Do you?

1312
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,000
I had another one tell me that I needed to choose between being a police

1313
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,960
officer and a mother because I couldn't be both.

1314
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,079
But would they have ever said that to a male police officer?

1315
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,000
No.

1316
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,639
But I had a belief in myself and I,

1317
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,079
I understood that this was going to be a problem and I didn't want to be the

1318
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:19,360
problem.

1319
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,760
I wanted to try to be the solution.

1320
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,679
So,

1321
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,860
um,

1322
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,219
and I often say to people,

1323
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:24,840
um,

1324
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,239
is,

1325
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:25,460
you know,

1326
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,260
you have to believe in yourself first and foremost,

1327
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,699
and you have to back yourself in.

1328
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:34,059
And that is a strong sense of self-leadership in every sense of the word.

1329
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:37,480
And it clearly is a huge part of you and what you've been able to achieve.

1330
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,739
We see leaders who are really conscious of how they positively impact others in

1331
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,239
their environment on a daily basis.

1332
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,559
I mean,

1333
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,679
you're impacting so many people with what you're doing and your research and

1334
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:47,920
your,

1335
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,139
and your leadership in this space.

1336
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:52,159
But how does that resonate with you impacting others in a positive way?

1337
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,840
I think,

1338
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,280
I think that's,

1339
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:53,860
you know,

1340
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,420
I think every person on this planet should be trying to do the right thing and

1341
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,000
should be,

1342
00:38:59,019 --> 00:38:59,219
you know,

1343
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,940
leaving a positive child behind rather than a negative one.

1344
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:02,840
Um,

1345
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,760
so I suppose again,

1346
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,380
that comes back from my upbringing,

1347
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,079
my policing career.

1348
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,099
And I mean,

1349
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:08,500
I,

1350
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,199
I worked at Fitzroy police station.

1351
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,099
Now Fitzroy is,

1352
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:11,440
you know,

1353
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,260
full of trendy cafes and it's nice now in the,

1354
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,599
um,

1355
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,119
mid eighties.

1356
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,679
It was not,

1357
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,519
it was a very,

1358
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,440
very different place.

1359
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,179
And it was,

1360
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,199
it was,

1361
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,300
um,

1362
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:22,820
divided into three,

1363
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,920
three clear areas.

1364
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,719
Um,

1365
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,900
the South of Fitzroy was a very,

1366
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,480
where the commission flights were,

1367
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,119
it was a very low socioeconomic rundown area.

1368
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,440
The middle was a slight step up.

1369
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,800
And if you were North Fitzroy,

1370
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,400
you were the,

1371
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,059
the gentry.

1372
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,900
So it was a very different world,

1373
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,559
um,

1374
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,380
to what even any policing is today.

1375
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,559
And I suppose I saw the worst of the worst.

1376
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,679
Um,

1377
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,219
you know,

1378
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,400
I dealt with child sexual abuse.

1379
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:49,579
I dealt with murders.

1380
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,820
I dealt with drugs.

1381
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:51,559
I dealt with,

1382
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:51,739
you know,

1383
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,159
I had,

1384
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:52,719
um,

1385
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,920
my nose broken in a pub.

1386
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,059
I was punched in the face trying to arrest a New South Wales escapee.

1387
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,000
Um,

1388
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:58,679
you know,

1389
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,500
so I did it tough then,

1390
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,579
but it was all about trying to make a difference in a positive way.

1391
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,980
And I think in the work that I do now,

1392
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:06,219
you know,

1393
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:09,800
I will never know how many people made a good choice based on listening to me

1394
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,440
speak or me coming into this school.

1395
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,360
But,

1396
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,659
you know,

1397
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,159
I'll often get a message going,

1398
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,599
you know,

1399
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:14,900
I got,

1400
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,780
I got one the other day.

1401
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,460
I heard you speak at a conference.

1402
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,800
I never thought I would need this knowledge as a parent,

1403
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,739
but I do because this,

1404
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:23,940
this just happened to my child.

1405
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:24,539
So,

1406
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:24,840
you know,

1407
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
I know that I'm making a difference.

1408
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:28,460
Um,

1409
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,760
and I think that that's just an important facet of,

1410
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,219
of being a decent human being.

1411
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:33,940
Yeah.

1412
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:34,500
Well said.

1413
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:34,980
Um,

1414
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,860
we see leaders are really conscious of how they go about creating and

1415
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,219
sharing her vision.

1416
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,820
And you've got a really clear vision for cyber safety and,

1417
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,519
and how we should engage in that world.

1418
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,599
How have you gone about trying to share that?

1419
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:46,380
Um,

1420
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,099
so it was very interesting.

1421
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,420
So I was,

1422
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,039
you know,

1423
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,579
pushing shit uphill,

1424
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:52,380
um,

1425
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,199
in the police force,

1426
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,360
trying to get them to listen and they wouldn't.

1427
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,800
And again,

1428
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,019
it was that blonde female,

1429
00:40:59,460 --> 00:40:59,800
you know,

1430
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,719
why would we listen to you?

1431
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,659
And it got very interesting because I,

1432
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,239
I got a little bit known.

1433
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,739
I came back from the States.

1434
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,059
I was,

1435
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm the only person in Australia with my qualifications and,

1436
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,639
and experience and the media got wind of me.

1437
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,679
So they would go to police media and ask to interview me and they get

1438
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,699
replies like this.

1439
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,059
Oh,

1440
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm really sorry.

1441
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,820
Susan's not available,

1442
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,159
but detective Smith,

1443
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:22,420
he's,

1444
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,460
he's from the arson squad,

1445
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:23,960
but you know,

1446
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:24,599
he'll be fine.

1447
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,780
And then they'd request again.

1448
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:27,360
Oh no,

1449
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,320
Susan's not available.

1450
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,079
Um,

1451
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,639
but detective Jones is,

1452
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:30,960
um,

1453
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:32,119
he's from the,

1454
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:32,480
uh,

1455
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,860
motor theft squad,

1456
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,460
but you know,

1457
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,119
he'll be your man,

1458
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,619
you know?

1459
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:36,179
So it was,

1460
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,280
they were stymieing me at every point and it was like,

1461
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,579
this is ridiculous.

1462
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,219
You know,

1463
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,480
I'm only trying to help.

1464
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,840
I went to work one day.

1465
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,800
It was the Tuesday after the black Saturday bushfires.

1466
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,960
And I went home and I said to my husband,

1467
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,440
I'm quitting.

1468
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,099
And I never went back.

1469
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,239
And it was like,

1470
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,860
I know that there is a problem.

1471
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,920
I know that I have an ability to help not hinder this problem.

1472
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,260
And if they're not going to value me,

1473
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,039
um,

1474
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,159
then I'm going to do it on my own.

1475
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,039
And the PR this was like February.

1476
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,559
So the preceding November,

1477
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,800
my mother had died and she got diagnosed with lung cancer and died in six

1478
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,059
weeks.

1479
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,059
And she was a non-smoker.

1480
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,280
So it was quite confronting.

1481
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,460
But I remember like on her deathbed,

1482
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:22,139
her saying to me,

1483
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,679
Susan,

1484
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,019
they don't value you.

1485
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:24,800
Um,

1486
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,099
you know,

1487
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,059
and that always rung in my,

1488
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:28,300
my mind that,

1489
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,539
well,

1490
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,039
perhaps I,

1491
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:33,420
I'm not being valued and perhaps I can make a difference outside the

1492
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,820
constraints of Victoria police.

1493
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:35,579
You know,

1494
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,219
I would never not have my police career.

1495
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,619
I loved 99% of my police career.

1496
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,239
Best part of my police career was an Academy romance with the person that is

1497
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,860
still my husband now after almost 40 years.

1498
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,460
So,

1499
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:48,900
you know,

1500
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,579
lots of benefits came with being a police officer.

1501
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:52,139
And I love it.

1502
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,019
I love the work and all of that,

1503
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,679
but I just know that I can do more now.

1504
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,679
And that's what I try my very best to do.

1505
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,679
And you know,

1506
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,679
I work in schools.

1507
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,679
I work with corporates.

1508
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,679
I do webinars.

1509
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,679
You know,

1510
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:05,679
I make myself available.

1511
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,679
Um,

1512
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,679
I make myself available to the media.

1513
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:10,679
I don't get paid for any media.

1514
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:11,679
Um,

1515
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,679
but my,

1516
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,679
my thought process is the story's going to run,

1517
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,679
right?

1518
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,679
Whether I'm available or not.

1519
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,679
And if they run the story with someone that doesn't know what they're saying,

1520
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,219
um,

1521
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:23,219
you know,

1522
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:24,219
the,

1523
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,219
uh,

1524
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:26,219
you know,

1525
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:27,219
Eddie everywhere,

1526
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:28,219
expert sort of person,

1527
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,219
um,

1528
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:30,219
then that's doing harm.

1529
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,219
So if I make myself available,

1530
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:36,219
then at least I know that I've got some control about the message that's being shared.

1531
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:38,219
And I think in an area where,

1532
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,219
you know,

1533
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:43,219
there are some things that you can talk about and the whole world knows you're lying,

1534
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,219
right?

1535
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:45,219
Cause they're already facts.

1536
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:46,219
They're already out there.

1537
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:47,219
Everyone knows,

1538
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:48,219
but with technology,

1539
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,219
there's still a lot of lack of information.

1540
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:51,219
So if I fed you a really good,

1541
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:55,059
you're a really good line and I'm touted as an expert by the media,

1542
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:55,599
you're going to go,

1543
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,760
ah,

1544
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,980
must be true.

1545
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,719
And I challenged journalists that quote people as experts,

1546
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:08,219
because technically an expert is someone whose evidence can be accepted in a court of law without being challenged.

1547
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:09,519
You've quoted them as an expert.

1548
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,179
What are their qualifications?

1549
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:12,179
Uh,

1550
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:15,179
they've got a website and,

1551
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:15,880
uh,

1552
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,760
they do talks and,

1553
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,019
you know,

1554
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:19,679
so,

1555
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:19,920
you know,

1556
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,420
to me,

1557
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,179
that's a social responsibility.

1558
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,980
Um,

1559
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,300
and,

1560
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:23,719
you know,

1561
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:31,099
I provide hundreds of pro bono hours to families to step them through and help them because where else do they go?

1562
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:31,679
And if I,

1563
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,179
if the,

1564
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:34,880
if the tables were turned and I needed that help,

1565
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,420
I don't want a chat bot that did not,

1566
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,940
does not understand my issue.

1567
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,559
I don't want to put an online form in that might get returned,

1568
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:42,179
you know,

1569
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,179
in a week.

1570
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,840
I need someone to help me now.

1571
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,940
In an issue that's confronting parents on a,

1572
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,380
you know,

1573
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,380
in a growth industry,

1574
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,019
tragically with more need than,

1575
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:50,880
than ever before.

1576
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,300
It's a huge amount of a positive impact that you have.

1577
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,840
Curiosity is something we see from everyone.

1578
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,260
I sit across from curiosity seems to be a really common trait of,

1579
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,920
of leadership.

1580
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,880
Does that word ring true to you?

1581
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,340
It does in that,

1582
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,719
you know,

1583
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,760
I'm always curious into what's going to happen next.

1584
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,880
What will it look like?

1585
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
How can I manage it?

1586
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,219
How can I improve myself and do better?

1587
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:16,679
I think it's about having an open mind and,

1588
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:16,960
you know,

1589
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,880
not switching off from things just because,

1590
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,300
um,

1591
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,679
always, um,

1592
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,099
always be curious,

1593
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:23,019
always think,

1594
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:23,179
well,

1595
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:23,920
okay,

1596
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,019
here it is now,

1597
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,440
but what might this look like?

1598
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
What might the potential good be?

1599
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,880
What might the potential bad be?

1600
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,719
And then how do we target that?

1601
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,340
And we see communicating with clarity,

1602
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:33,639
which,

1603
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,059
uh,

1604
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:35,019
you're brilliant at,

1605
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:36,679
and you get your message across,

1606
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:36,920
you know,

1607
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,760
incredibly clearly.

1608
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:38,980
And,

1609
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,380
and,

1610
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,599
you know,

1611
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,059
sometimes it's confronting because we,

1612
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:41,380
you know,

1613
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,519
the,

1614
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:42,340
the language is,

1615
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:42,840
is,

1616
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,300
is intense at times.

1617
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,920
But how have you gone about communicating that message?

1618
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,719
Hopefully with clarity.

1619
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:50,519
It's interesting.

1620
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:54,599
One of the things I say when I speak to young people is

1621
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:54,820
that,

1622
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,280
and I'll say at the start of my talk,

1623
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,639
I'm going to be blunt.

1624
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:59,019
I'm going to be direct.

1625
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:02,059
And there is no wriggle room in what I say.

1626
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,860
And for me,

1627
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,019
that's important because I need to share really important facts.

1628
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:09,019
And especially when I'm talking about laws.

1629
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:09,559
Um,

1630
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,400
if I give any audience wriggle room,

1631
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,360
I know what they will do.

1632
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,599
They will twist it to suit them,

1633
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,139
or they'll twist it to what they want to hear.

1634
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:19,760
So that then that's a failing as well.

1635
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:19,940
So,

1636
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,440
if you leave my sessions confused,

1637
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,360
then I failed.

1638
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,320
So no wriggle room here it is.

1639
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,699
Is it always fair?

1640
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:28,519
No.

1641
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,320
Is it factual?

1642
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Yes.

1643
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,980
And you cannot expect any person,

1644
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,739
particularly young people to make,

1645
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:39,019
or even try to make a good choice if they haven't been given the facts.

1646
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:39,639
It's like saying,

1647
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:40,360
read this book,

1648
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,940
but we're going to test you on a different one and hope for the best.

1649
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,780
And the,

1650
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,900
the cost of harm to young people that get themselves into situations,

1651
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,519
on the internet,

1652
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,280
get targeted,

1653
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,239
et cetera,

1654
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,659
is enormous.

1655
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:54,280
And,

1656
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,559
you know,

1657
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,360
we all have to do more to make sure that,

1658
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:57,559
you know,

1659
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,139
for me,

1660
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:04,739
every adult has a responsibility to try to keep all children safe online so that children don't get mixed messages.

1661
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:04,980
You know,

1662
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,739
it's like the good cop,

1663
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,820
bad cop parents,

1664
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,400
you know,

1665
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,559
the child will go to the good cop to get the lollies,

1666
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,480
but they won't ask the bad cop parent because they will say no.

1667
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,599
So it's the same thing.

1668
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,940
You want them to get the same message from school,

1669
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,820
from home,

1670
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,780
from the sport club,

1671
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,059
the co-curricular activity,

1672
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:19,699
from grandparents.

1673
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,280
Aunts,

1674
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,500
uncles,

1675
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,739
and cousins,

1676
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,400
because consistent messaging works.

1677
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,119
Which leads to the next dimension that I want to talk to you about,

1678
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,159
which is collaboration.

1679
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,159
To do that,

1680
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,119
we see leaders are really conscious now of collaborating and you're right,

1681
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,320
even on the home front,

1682
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,539
if you're not collaborating with your partner on this,

1683
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,000
you don't get anywhere or the extended family.

1684
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I mean,

1685
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,820
how important has collaboration been for you in your space?

1686
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,280
It's been really important.

1687
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,000
And,

1688
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,460
you know,

1689
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,159
again,

1690
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,360
I don't know it all.

1691
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,659
I have some knowledge and my knowledge is better than most people.

1692
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,239
But then there are other people with different knowledge.

1693
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:53,500
And I think in this space,

1694
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,320
because it's so fluid,

1695
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,500
it requires a multifaceted approach.

1696
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,360
So there are people,

1697
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,659
there are tech expert people.

1698
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:02,659
Like I couldn't pull a phone apart to save my life,

1699
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,000
but there are people that can,

1700
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,360
and they can get the data off the phone.

1701
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,619
There are people that,

1702
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:09,460
you know,

1703
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,699
the adolescent psychologists and psychiatrists that work with the mental health harms.

1704
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:19,239
There are academics that just churn through research after research to look at patterns of emerging behavior.

1705
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:25,159
And I think that this is where we all need to work together because we all have something to bring to the table.

1706
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:29,780
And there's no one thing that is going to solve this in isolation.

1707
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,400
What will solve problems,

1708
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,860
any problem,

1709
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,119
is the mass coming at it from the same,

1710
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,739
the same direction with the same expectations.

1711
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:45,440
So if everyone expects a platform to protect their users,

1712
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,579
then it will force the platform to do the right thing.

1713
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:48,860
But,

1714
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,320
but if people are happy to stay there and accept a substandard experience,

1715
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,739
then what incentive is there to change?

1716
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,199
They'll come out with all the talk.

1717
00:48:59,199 --> 00:48:59,280
Oh,

1718
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,619
yappy,

1719
00:48:59,619 --> 00:48:59,900
yappy,

1720
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,199
yap.

1721
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah,

1722
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:00,559
yeah,

1723
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:00,980
yeah.

1724
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,699
We do this,

1725
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:03,559
read our T's and C's,

1726
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:04,019
but it,

1727
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:04,820
you know,

1728
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,940
actions speak louder than words.

1729
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,159
Yeah.

1730
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:10,280
I'm incredibly new to the online space of social.

1731
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,940
I thought it passed me by,

1732
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,280
Susan,

1733
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,659
which might've been a happy experience,

1734
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:15,980
but through the web.

1735
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,980
Are you a TikToker?

1736
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,239
No,

1737
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:18,239
I'm not TikToker,

1738
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:18,820
but I,

1739
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,320
I did my first experience with my 17 year old daughter on that the other day,

1740
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,820
which was mind blowing around,

1741
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,199
you know,

1742
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,059
are you team Johnny Depp or team Amber Heard?

1743
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:27,360
I said,

1744
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,360
what are you even talking about?

1745
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,199
And then 40 minutes of my life was gone scrolling through,

1746
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:32,739
through TikToker.

1747
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:36,360
So how easy was it to lose 40 minutes as an adult?

1748
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,119
Stunning.

1749
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,699
So couldn't believe it.

1750
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:39,619
Couldn't believe that,

1751
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:40,019
you know,

1752
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:44,059
someone had disseminated that case into a really skewed version around,

1753
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:44,579
you know,

1754
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:44,900
and,

1755
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,239
and,

1756
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:45,860
and it just,

1757
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,360
it was so.

1758
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,320
So it was really easy for you.

1759
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,519
Yeah.

1760
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:48,820
With,

1761
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,219
you know,

1762
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,280
life experiences,

1763
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:50,860
maturity,

1764
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,860
fully formed brain,

1765
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,179
all of that.

1766
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:55,860
Think about the impact on young people.

1767
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,860
And I laugh,

1768
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,320
you know,

1769
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,820
again,

1770
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,059
I'm much older than you,

1771
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:03,280
but I got a little message from Meta this week to say,

1772
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,019
congratulations.

1773
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:10,360
You are in the top 2% of content creators on Facebook.

1774
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,099
Now,

1775
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,219
what the hell is a content creator?

1776
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:12,440
Like,

1777
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,639
you know,

1778
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,480
I do know what one is,

1779
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,679
but when I sat down with my careers teacher at high school,

1780
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:17,860
content creator,

1781
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,059
an influencer were not two job opportunities.

1782
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,360
So here is someone that is mature of age,

1783
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
use technology only relatively recently,

1784
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,780
of course,

1785
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,699
like in the last 20 years,

1786
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,699
but you know,

1787
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,159
there I am being acknowledged as,

1788
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,099
as being able to manage this sort of space.

1789
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,320
But I do laugh at that because it's like,

1790
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,940
okay,

1791
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,099
I think that's good.

1792
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:44,820
I think your story is a great leadership story in every sense in a,

1793
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,159
in a space that we all have to confront,

1794
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,199
whether we like it or not,

1795
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:50,579
but asking these final two questions,

1796
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:51,079
Susan,

1797
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:53,659
of all the guests on this empowering leaders podcast,

1798
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:56,400
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1799
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Oh my goodness.

1800
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,400
That is such a hard question.

1801
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,159
And,

1802
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:01,780
you know,

1803
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,920
there's leaders in different,

1804
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,039
in different ways.

1805
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,659
And I look at,

1806
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:06,960
um,

1807
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,659
I look at my parents,

1808
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:09,039
um,

1809
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,619
that certainly were exceptional leaders for their time.

1810
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:13,860
And my father,

1811
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,780
um,

1812
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,920
he gave so much of his life,

1813
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,619
to the country and to volunteering.

1814
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,460
He was a world war two veteran.

1815
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,039
Um,

1816
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,960
he was a talented footballer and tennis player,

1817
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,000
a life member of the diamond Valley football league,

1818
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,380
life member of the country fire authority,

1819
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,539
Queens fire service medal.

1820
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:31,920
Um,

1821
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,260
he never asked for thanks or acknowledgement of anything that he did.

1822
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,579
He gave back,

1823
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:37,039
um,

1824
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,579
and then mum by default supported him in doing that.

1825
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,219
Um,

1826
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:43,619
I look at my husband as a leader.

1827
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:44,039
Um,

1828
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,039
he's a forensic crash investigator.

1829
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:46,920
He worked with major,

1830
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,920
major collision in Victoria police and successfully runs his own company as well.

1831
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,340
So he leads,

1832
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:53,679
you know,

1833
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:56,880
us and has been an amazing father.

1834
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,800
I look at,

1835
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,039
and something I didn't mention before,

1836
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:00,460
I think is important about,

1837
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:00,719
you know,

1838
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,500
obviously trusting your gut,

1839
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,039
but getting a mentor,

1840
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,760
getting someone else that believes in you.

1841
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,719
Cause it's all very well going.

1842
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:06,960
Yeah,

1843
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,380
I think I'm okay.

1844
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,420
But when you hear it from someone else,

1845
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,840
I think that adds to your credibility.

1846
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,119
And I've had the most amazing mentor in Dr.

1847
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:15,619
Michael Carr,

1848
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:16,340
Greg,

1849
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,340
who believed in me from the get go,

1850
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,960
told me I was actually really good at what I did.

1851
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
Cause up until that point,

1852
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,539
I was me,

1853
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,719
I was a police officer with an interest in this.

1854
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:25,260
Um,

1855
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,960
I could clearly string a sentence together,

1856
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
bit different to some police officers.

1857
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,300
People go,

1858
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,719
what media training did you do?

1859
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,579
None.

1860
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:32,639
But you know,

1861
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,219
he,

1862
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:35,719
I still remember the first time he heard me speak and it was like,

1863
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,039
wow,

1864
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,340
this is amazing.

1865
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,500
You need to do more with this knowledge.

1866
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,639
You are wasted in Victoria police.

1867
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:42,179
So,

1868
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:42,460
you know,

1869
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,139
he certainly has been a leader for me to look up to and support me.

1870
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:46,559
In,

1871
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,380
in what I do now and moving forward.

1872
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,099
I love your answer.

1873
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:49,900
Isn't it often,

1874
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,179
you know,

1875
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:50,519
it's a,

1876
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:51,980
it's a question that,

1877
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,340
you know,

1878
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,099
without notice,

1879
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:55,260
you think about your family and if you've had great influences in your

1880
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,599
family or a great partner,

1881
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:57,380
people go there.

1882
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,900
But to then,

1883
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,480
as you said,

1884
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,599
if you get someone in your life,

1885
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,900
he backs you in like Dr.

1886
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,380
Michael Carr,

1887
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:01,639
Greg,

1888
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,340
who's got a great legacy for the work that he has done here and around the

1889
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,019
world.

1890
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,179
If you could collaborate with anyone and clearly you've got a clear passion in

1891
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:10,760
this space,

1892
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,019
is there someone out there you think,

1893
00:53:12,019 --> 00:53:12,179
God,

1894
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:15,900
if I could connect with them anywhere around the world on any of your passions

1895
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:15,980
in life,

1896
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,780
is there anyone that springs to life?

1897
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,519
Oh my goodness.

1898
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:18,860
Um,

1899
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,480
who would I like to collaborate with?

1900
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,010
Oh,

1901
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,750
that is such a hard question.

1902
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,550
Um,

1903
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,130
I don't know that there's anyone out there that I think,

1904
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:29,489
oh gee,

1905
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:30,010
I really,

1906
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:30,289
really,

1907
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:32,869
really would like to collaborate with them.

1908
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,829
There's people that I admire and I think,

1909
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:36,170
wow,

1910
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,130
it'd be really amazing to meet you and chat with you.

1911
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:39,949
Um,

1912
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:40,909
and things like that.

1913
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:41,750
And you know,

1914
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,170
I still remember like I have been extremely lucky.

1915
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:45,710
Um,

1916
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,090
and again,

1917
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,010
I talk to kids about opportunities.

1918
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,349
And the thing with an opportunity is you don't know it's going to happen

1919
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:53,550
until it happens.

1920
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,670
And it's about taking those opportunities.

1921
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,389
And you know,

1922
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:59,849
I have met some famous people,

1923
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:00,510
if you like.

1924
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:01,389
Um,

1925
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:05,590
I've met Prince Charles and Princess Diana when they visited Melbourne many

1926
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,630
years ago on a tour.

1927
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,210
I was doing,

1928
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,050
um,

1929
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:08,849
crowd control,

1930
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:09,510
uh,

1931
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,929
for them,

1932
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:11,050
for want of a better word.

1933
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,010
I've met Prince William at an event that he and I both spoke at.

1934
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,769
Can you imagine that I'm on the same speaker?

1935
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:19,809
Speaking gig as Prince William,

1936
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:23,530
who is also passionate about bullying and harassment of young people.

1937
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:24,570
Um,

1938
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,269
I went into a studio in London to film for sunrise.

1939
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,230
I need to be met by David Williams,

1940
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,070
the,

1941
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:31,389
um,

1942
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:32,610
the actor and author.

1943
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,429
Um,

1944
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:36,230
and they're all people in their own right that I think,

1945
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,610
you know,

1946
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,769
are doing good in the world and it's been an honor to meet them.

1947
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,349
But the funniest story,

1948
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:42,889
and you will laugh at this as,

1949
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:43,309
um,

1950
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:44,389
a former footballer.

1951
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:47,769
I remember working in a school in Melbourne and I was asked,

1952
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:48,650
the question,

1953
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,730
have I met anyone famous now at that point?

1954
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:53,769
And it was a Catholic school,

1955
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:54,650
primary school.

1956
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:55,650
So I said,

1957
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,570
I've met the Pope,

1958
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,650
which I had because again,

1959
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,929
he was out and we'd done close personal protection for the Pope.

1960
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:03,570
It didn't seem to resonate with the kids,

1961
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,530
but I'd met the Pope.

1962
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:08,190
So they said anyone else?

1963
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:08,730
And I said,

1964
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,070
oh,

1965
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:10,610
I've met Paul Salmon.

1966
00:55:10,969 --> 00:55:11,429
Well,

1967
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:14,429
the room erupted and it was like,

1968
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:15,389
oh my God,

1969
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:15,730
you know?

1970
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,349
And I'm thinking,

1971
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:17,570
I came in a Catholic school.

1972
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,570
And the Pope's not winning it.

1973
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:19,190
Um,

1974
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,190
but Paul Salmon came to the forefront there.

1975
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,070
So I've had an interesting life,

1976
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:24,489
but again,

1977
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,869
it's about opportunities.

1978
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,070
It's about knowing your audience,

1979
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:27,369
isn't it?

1980
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,230
It is knowing your audience,

1981
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,150
but who would have thought?

1982
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,030
The great fish,

1983
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,690
Paul Salmon,

1984
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,909
who was a legend at Essendon and Hawthorne football club.

1985
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:34,409
But,

1986
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:34,730
uh,

1987
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,070
it's an incredible legacy.

1988
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,809
I feel like you're just getting started,

1989
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:38,190
Susan.

1990
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,329
I feel like we're all starting to really understand.

1991
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:41,909
And as you said,

1992
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,809
take our own sense of leadership in this space.

1993
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,690
It's the thing that comes up the most in the,

1994
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,110
when I'm speaking to someone from sports,

1995
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,150
from sport or another industry,

1996
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,110
everyone as a parent or in their own world,

1997
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,190
they're dealing with this space.

1998
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,949
So to have you as such a clear voice,

1999
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:56,769
and really,

2000
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:57,610
as you said,

2001
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,449
there's no wiggle room in your language,

2002
00:55:58,449 --> 00:55:59,989
you know exactly where you sit.

2003
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:00,809
It's a,

2004
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:01,650
it's great to,

2005
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,489
you know,

2006
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:03,309
be able to sit down with you.

2007
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:04,150
And thanks for sharing it today.

2008
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,989
And it's my pleasure.

2009
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:09,269
And thank you so much for inviting me to have a chat.

2010
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,849
Empowering Leaders was presented by me,

2011
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:11,769
Luke Darcy,

2012
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,050
produced by Ed Gooden,

2013
