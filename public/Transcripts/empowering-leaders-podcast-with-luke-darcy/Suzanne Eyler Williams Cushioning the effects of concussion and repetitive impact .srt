1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:09,380
everyone talks about concussions the real epidemic are these repetitive hits that are

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,220
happening and you don't even know it's happening concussions don't come from the hit they come from

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,379
the brain sloshing within the skull every time your brain sloshes it can compromise the integrity

4
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,559
of the structure which can cause an injury and so when you back that out and you actually think

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,660
about repetitive head impacts and you take it out of context of just concussions it's actually quite

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,320
alarming it's like trying to say one sunburn caused your skin to be unhealthy or one pack of

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,880
cigarettes compromised your lung health hello welcome to the empowering leaders podcast at

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,679
elita we are passionate about inspiring connections and in our signature program elita connect we

9
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,679
curate groups of five to six leaders from diverse backgrounds be it sport industry social venture

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,979
and the arts who come together to learn to connect and collaborate dr troy flanagan

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:02,039
you

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:10,700
I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that leadership group the

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,459
significance of their work and how much it's really about helping others it made me think

14
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:20,579
what else could I be doing and I approached our our owner and within a few weeks we'd raised

15
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,959
five million dollars to try and solve obesity in the underprivileged community in Milwaukee

16
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,040
so that's one spark that that leadership courses cause it to go

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,560
and to help them to contribute and leave the the world as a better place.

18

umrah omar founder of safari doctors it defines the word creativity for me the ability to like

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,180
see connections where none seem to exist and I think that's the magic of a leader definitely

20
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:56,700
not my usual you know workshop panels like humanitarian spaces but more of an intentional

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,219
um dissection of the leadership

22
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,299
leadership

search to find a solution to concussion related injuries suzanne prior to q collar spent 17 years

39
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,340
as a senior executive in sports marketing at under armor and was herself a three-time all-american

40
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,379
athlete at liola university in maryland great to see you suzanne thanks for joining me yeah thanks

41
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,740
for having me pleasure to be here now it sounds like a life full of great success and when you

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,759
look back at what you've achieved and you hear me say that back to you what's the main feeling that

43
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,800
you receive you know

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,259
i i just astonishment i've just been so blessed i've had so many great uh experiences but really

45
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,099
i've been surrounded by great people and it started in high school went through college

46
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:50,280
my first job which was coaching at the collegiate level and then it flowed to under armor and

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,800
just truly blessed to be around mentors at every turn in my life and even into q

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,520
collar now with q30 i've just been blessed to be around incredible people

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,080
i want to start if i can suzanne with the impacts of head knocks and concussion related

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,860
injuries and what it means is probably the biggest issue in world sport as we speak can you tell us

51
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,120
about your passion for q collar and the role that it might play in this yeah it's uh it's a topic

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,540
that i've become very passionate about and if you would have told me 10 years ago i would have been

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,600
i wouldn't have believed you but i got involved with q collar about three years ago and it was

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,779
perfect timing um i've been in under armor for a long time and i've been in under armor for a long time

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,879
for 17 years loved it never wanted to leave um and i have two sons and they were middle school

56
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,199
aged and you know they were athletic so they played every sport under the sun and really you

57
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:54,139
know baseball soccer you know basketball tennis golf swimming and then they came to me and my

58
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,860
oldest one said mom i want to quit all my other sports and i just want to play football i just

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,019
want to be lamar jackson

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,699
and my heart sank and here i am you know a champion of football i love the sport

61
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:14,860
and at under armor it was our king sport i was involved in it every day but when it was time

62
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:22,740
to sign my child up i got nervous because it is a very physical sport and a week later so a week

63
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,680
after that happened and you know i kind of played it off with my my oldest i was like oh yeah we'll

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,279
figure it out i'll look up some leagues but really you know i'm talking to his dad like how do we get

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,720
his mind without him knowing you know we're behind the scenes like trying to figure out how we can get

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,800
him to stick with baseball a week later i got a phone call from a mutual friend and said look

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,800
um this group from connecticut called q collar has got this amazing device they're going to go

68
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,180
commercial they need someone to run sports marketing would you talk to them and i was like

69
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,399
sure this is interesting but i really don't have any ambition to leave but i am curious because

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,459
and it was almost divine intervention because i met tom our ceo and what he explained to me luke

71
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,139
which i didn't know because i was like everyone else i just thought concussions were an issue

72
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:19,980
right everyone talks about concussions but in reality the issue is the repetitive head impacts

73
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,560
that are happening every game every practice all the time and they don't have to be concussive hits

74
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,459
they don't have to be hits that have symptoms which is how you diagnose a concussion

75
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,579
the real issue are these repetitive hits that are happening and you don't even know it's happening

76
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:41,800
and so tom really broke it down for me and explained hey you know we've got this device

77
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,699
it's been researched for over 10 years you know all these studies have been done 25 independent

78
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,120
studies and the results are showing that wearing it can help reduce brain slosh can help mitigate

79
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,639
brain slosh which is what's causing the concussions right the concussions don't come from the hit

80
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,759
they come from the brain sloshing within the skull

81
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,579
and what i have found is that when you actually look at how many impacts athletes take and this

82
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,779
is not just contact sports this is soccer right this is you know equestrian rodeo big wave surfers

83
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:20,839
mountain bikers these are all different sports you know every time your brain sloshes it can

84
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:27,040
compromise the integrity of the structure which can cause an injury and so when you back that out

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,959
and you actually think about repetitive head impacts and you take it out of context of just

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,620
it's actually quite alarming and the way i explain it to athletes and i know i'm droning on very long

87
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,480
here but the way i explain it to athletes is it's like trying to say one sunburn caused your skin to

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:52,120
be unhealthy or one pack of cigarettes compromised your lung health it's not it's the overexposure to

89
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,000
sunlight it's the exposure to smoke it's the exposure to repetitive hits that can ultimately

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,740
compromise your health short-term and long-term and so

91
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,100
really luke our mission is to educate folks on repetitive head impacts not just let them focus

92
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,220
on concussions which is a great distinction to make because i think that conversation has been

93
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,860
lost in all of this that you know we've now got this incredible fear quite rightly and you've told

94
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,139
the great personal story as a mom you know i want my boys to be healthy i want to protect them

95
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,639
as we all do but i think that's a it's a great distinction and perhaps this is where

96
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,740
the conversation needs to go and i love the

97
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,700
fact story this i was reading that the inventor was studying the anatomy of woodpeckers you know

98
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,860
and can you tell us about the idea of how q collar has been formed on studying woodpeckers

99
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,080
yeah and it's a it's a great story and it's inspiring so the actual genesis of the q collar

100
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,600
most people don't know it came about because the u.s army went to a group of doctors and said look

101
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,639
we are losing too many of our war fighters in afghanistan to tbi traumatic brain injury

102
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:09,720
and you know that that afghanistan war went for 20 years so you're losing all these very

103
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,580
important war fighters and one of the doctors that they went to said you know the army general

104
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,080
said build us a better helmet and one of the doctors said it's not the helmet right if it

105
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,259
was the helmet we'd have a solution it's the fact that we're not stabilizing the brain within the

106
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:31,320
skull and he used the analogy it's like putting a soldier in a tank without a seat belt

107
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,419
it doesn't matter if you're in a tank if you move within the tank you're going to get injured

108
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,620
and he said we need to find a way to stabilize the brain within the skull that means we need

109
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,899
to find a solution from the inside out and he's an internist doctor and so he started looking at

110
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,440
how do i find inspiration within nature how did they do it so he looked at woodpeckers he looked

111
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,580
at battling rams right these are animals that bang their heads consistently but are okay just

112
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,480
to the extent

113
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,000
and so you know people get this a little bit confused because our anatomy is not the same

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,740
as a woodpecker's so it's not a translation from a to b but he used that woodpecker theory

115
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,620
as inspiration to start looking inside the human body and what he found is that if you compress

116
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,860
the jugular vein slightly which we have on the outside of our necks there's a muscle over top

117
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,200
of it if you can compress that muscle slightly it presses on your jugular vein

118
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,759
and it keeps about a teaspoon of extra blood backfilled in the veins around your brain

119
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:43,220
and those veins swell and they act like a seat belt and he took that research or that concept

120
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,919
that theory to a neurosurgeon named dr julian bales and he asked julian just to test it on

121
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:56,580
animals and julian did rat rats and pigs in his laboratory and found an 80 reduction in brain

122
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,779
injury so the theory started from you know how does nature do it and then julian did a lot of

123
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,840
translation over into the human body and reading more about it suzanne it sounds a little bit

124
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,980
alarming to say we're going to restrict some blood flow uh you know to the head uh and keep that

125
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,279
blood in there but effectively you're talking about the same pressure as wearing a tie if you're

126
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,620
wearing a suit and so it's marginal but you're then not allowing the brain to slosh around to

127
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,679
use your term and that's where the head injuries come from and and it's the as you're saying it's

128
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,860
the repeat nature of that even if they're smaller but consistent that's that's what's causing the

129
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,779
damage from from the rest of the brain and that's what's causing the damage from the rest of the

130
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,679
research you guys have have taken yeah and and the big um you know part that people don't

131
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,740
understand is that you're not actually restricting any blood going to your head so blood is still

132
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,259
going up through your artery which is inside you know you can't get to it so that's going up like

133
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,580
normal the only blood that's restricted is the blood that's recirculating back to your heart so

134
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,639
it's blood that's already been oxygenated it's gone up into your head it's now flowing back

135
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,820
through your jugular vein to return to your heart

136
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:08,139
so we tell guys it's like putting your thumb over a hose right the water is still getting out

137
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:15,820
it's just a little bit slowed so there's absolutely no physical uh impact negatively so

138
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,860
in order for the testing to to really start clinically they had to do performance testing

139
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,379
and so this performance testing measured you know how much of that blood needed to be restricted to

140
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,940
fill the veins it doesn't change your heart rate it doesn't change your blood oxygen levels it

141
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,700
doesn't impede your blood oxygen levels it doesn't change your blood oxygen levels it doesn't impede

142
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,200
any of the blood going to your head, it doesn't change your reaction time, you know, there's no

143
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,039
adverse effects to it. And you nailed it, Luke, it's the same pressure as a necktie.

144
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:45,159
It's a little bit over a pound of pressure, which a necktie is a little bit under a pound. So

145
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:51,700
it's very much like you're going to a wedding and you have a shirt on and a necktie. It's very much

146
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,679
the same feeling. There's absolutely no adverse effects. And once all that testing was done,

147
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,720
that's when the clinical trial started. And clinical trials included humans. So there's

148
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
real data. And I can get into it a little bit because, you know, concussions are subjective

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,659
and there's no diagnostic test that proves you had one or you didn't. All the tests are based

150
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:21,220
on symptoms. And so from a research perspective, the medical community does not accept research

151
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,039
on concussions because it's reliably unreliable. So in order to

152
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:33,299
find real data, they used MRI DTI scans, which actually look at the brain structure

153
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:39,720
and the white and gray matter of the brain. And by using those MRI scans, they could actually see

154
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,240
if the brain structure was ever compromised. And that's how they based the clinical research.

155
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,259
So they looked at very young, healthy brains in high school players, soccer, football, and hockey.

156
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,659
They baselined all of them first. They gave half of the athletes,

157
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:02,059
cue collars, half not. And they went and played their entire seasons, every practice, every game.

158
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,100
And at the end of the year, they re-MRI'd their brains and they compared the two scans,

159
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,940
pre-season and post-season. And what they found were the athletes wearing cue collars,

160
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:19,019
77% showed zero changes in their white brain matter. So their brains were as healthy at the

161
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:25,440
end of the season as the beginning. But the athletes not wearing cue collars, 73% saw

162
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,659
significant changes. And so they compared the two scans, pre-season and post-season.

163
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:34,399
So regardless of whether they had a symptom or diagnosed concussion, there were changes in

164
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,600
their brain structure. 20 of those athletes were diagnosed with concussions. Some were in cue

165
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,620
collars, some were not. What the scans showed were the athletes wearing the device. Their return to

166
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,580
play was much shorter and their brain scans showed significantly less damage than the athletes not

167
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,059
wearing cue collars. So when you put it in the context of a seatbelt, it's like being in a car.

168
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:02,019
You put it on because you know in the chance of an accident, it's going to help reduce your body

169
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,820
moving in the car. And I tell athletes it can mitigate an injury or can lessen the severity

170
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,120
of an injury does occur. Like I would rather bruise my ribs for my seatbelt than fly through

171
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,940
the windshield. So we try to talk to athletes, give them a really good understanding of you want

172
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,580
to reduce brain slosh. There's no magic pill that's going to keep you injury free. But if you

173
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,039
can reduce brain slosh, you can reduce brain slosh. So if you can reduce brain slosh, you can

174
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,019
reduce the chance of an injury, you're putting yourself in a better position.

175
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,240
So Suzanne, I'm going to ask you to put the mum hat back on for a moment. I've got this

176
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,639
sense that we need to have a real conversation about risk. It's an odd saying that I love. You

177
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,919
risk nothing, you risk everything. And what sport has meant to you, I want to talk about your

178
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:52,139
athletic career, your fiance Mike and his world of sport. That has been such a fundamental part

179
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,980
to your life, fundamental part to my life. There's always going to be risk. Now we want to,

180
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,879
you know, mitigate the risk. And some of the head issues have been life ending for people. So

181
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,799
we're not diminishing that. Do you think we need to still have this conversation around mitigating

182
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,460
risk and the incredible benefits of playing sport at whatever level you do? Does that conversation

183
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,659
need to be had? Absolutely. And look, look, we, we live in a world where you can't get rid of all

184
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:21,879
risk. I mean, that's just, that's just the nature of who we are and what we do. And, and what I got

185
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:28,500
from sport and how I feel about sport far outweighs, you know, any reason to not play. But if

186
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:36,539
you can put yourself in a position to avoid injury or to do all you can to be successful, why not do

187
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:43,340
it? And, um, I talked to athletes and I, I mentioned, you know, you guys eat, right? You

188
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,240
train, right? You sleep, right? You recover, right? You do all these little things to have

189
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,679
an advantage. This is no different, right? It, it, and, and I,

190
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,399
and I laugh about this Luke, cause you probably can remember this and Mike, you know, you mentioned

191
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,980
Mike, Mike was the head coach at Notre Dame for 23 years and he's now at the Atlanta Hawks. But

192
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,839
Mike remembers when he was at Notre Dame, no one believed in sleep, that sleep was important to

193
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,440
the athletes and he would be at Notre Dame and you know, they would, they would never talk about

194
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,500
sleep. And then some cockamamie people started showing up being like, Hey, we should really

195
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,180
work on sleep with your athletes. And half of the department was like, nah, that's a waste.

196
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,859
They're college kids are going to stay up late. Who cares? And so there,

197
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,259
there were people pushing this, this importance of sleep. Well, fast forward now, sleep is a major

198
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,460
part of training and the same thing with nutrition. And I laugh about this when we were in college,

199
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,599
nutrition did not exist. We got $5. You went to McDonald's after a game pregame was candy on the

200
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,500
bus. Like, I mean, it just didn't matter. And we were elite athletes. Nutrition just wasn't

201
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,559
something that was focused on. Now you go to college campuses and pro facilities.

202
00:17:51,559 --> 00:18:01,240
I mean, food is the fuel. So, you know, whenever people dismiss advances in technology or methods

203
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,180
of training or prevention, you know, I get it. There's a tipping point, a learning curve. And I

204
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,720
believe this is just one of them. People have to understand there is a way to mitigate risk.

205
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,980
And if you can wear it, you should do it and do everything you can to try to put yourself in the

206
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,400
best position to stay safe and stay available. Yeah. And we understand a lot more about,

207
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,519
yeah.

208
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,880
Head and concussion too. And in our era, there was a saying that injuries above the neck don't

209
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,200
count. Just say your name and go back out again. And that's how archaic it was. And we have come

210
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,480
a long way. You mentioned a fiance, Mike Bray, legendary coach of Notre Dame and now at the

211
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,539
Atlanta Hawks and two young athletes in your house, two boys that I believe are great athletes

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,799
in their own right. Can you tell us a bit about, they're growing up surrounded by sporting success

213
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,519
with their mom and their home front. What's that like?

214
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,579
For you as a parent, what sort of leader are you on the home front?

215
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:02,200
Yeah. I had great mentors to look up to, which were my parents. And Mike will say the same thing. So

216
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,660
Mike and I both grew up in households where our fathers were high school coaches, high school ADs

217
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,019
and educators. And so we had the same background, right? I grew up in a gym. My dad, I followed him

218
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:20,059
around. He was the high school basketball coach, the wrestling coach, the baseball coach. He was

219
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,400
my idol. I followed him around. I was a gym coach. I was a basketball coach. I was a basketball coach.

220
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,799
I was a gym rat. Mike was the same way. And the thing that we both talk about that made the

221
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,299
biggest impression on us is that our parents never put any pressure on us to be successful

222
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:41,680
on the field. It just was such a calming environment where they gave us opportunities

223
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,819
to compete and they supported us in every way. But there was never this expectation or pressure.

224
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:57,740
In fact, my dad wouldn't even talk to me after a game. I would be dying to talk to him after a game.

225
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:02,220
How would you think of this layup? When I miss this, what did I do here? He wouldn't talk about

226
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,359
it unless I brought it up with him. He would get in the car. He'd never say a word. If I made a

227
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,119
mistake, he never talked about it. My mom was the same way. Mike's parents were the same way. So

228
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:19,799
we have a very strong opinion about that. We do not encourage the boys to

229
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:25,779
take things to heart. They're young. They're learning. You're supposed to enjoy the game.

230
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,160
Be well-rounded. We both are multi-sport athletes. My children are multi-sport athletes. We think

231
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,400
that's healthy, healthy for their mind, healthy for their body. We just have probably a little

232
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:45,539
bit more of a relaxed environment. But we also are very passionate about schoolwork and teamwork,

233
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,380
that you got to do your schoolwork, got to be good in school,

234
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:54,359
but ultimately you got to be a great teammate. And that might mean you're not the best on the

235
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,059
team or you score the most goals or you're the best defender, but you better be the best leader

236
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,660
you can be and be the best teammate. And a lot of times after practice or a game,

237
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,079
instead of asking how you did or what you think, it's always, did you try to lead today? Were you

238
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,099
helpful to your teammates? Did you encourage your teammates? Were you a confidence giver to your

239
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,660
teammates? Because ultimately, Mike was the best confidence.

240
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:27,400
To his athletes. I learned that from him. And I want my children to understand that giving

241
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,799
confidence to your teammate is priceless. And your teammate will appreciate that and look to you for

242
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,660
that. It's a real piece of wisdom you've just shared. I love hearing it. I love asking that

243
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,599
question because I often find that the successful athletes that have kids of their own totally get

244
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,099
that. And I see this other really ugly parenting thing that's happening in junior sport around the

245
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:55,359
parents are the opposite, screaming from the sidelines, conversation in the car on the way

246
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,400
home often kills the passion for sport with their kids because they are all about why didn't you

247
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,500
score more or why didn't you play like your teammate? And so to hear people who are at the

248
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,400
professional end and understanding the way that you just described is such a great thing. I want

249
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,039
to go back to ask you about Under Armour. What an incredible story that is. Kevin Plank was a 23-year

250
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,799
old captain of the United States. He was a 23-year-old captain of the United States. He was a

251
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:27,380
football team to go and really take on Nike and Lululemon, these huge big apparel brands with

252
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,559
success. When you look back at Under Armour and you were there right from the start, you had 17

253
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,480
years. Why was that such a success in your mind? God, Under Armour was such a special place and I

254
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,859
have so much love for the brand and all the people still there. And it just was such a magical time

255
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:49,740
to be a part of something. But Kevin is fabulous. He's as fabulous as you can imagine.

256
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:59,079
His ability to lead and grow a business out of, you know, his grandmother's basement home is just

257
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,660
remarkable. What I love the most about it, and I was so fortunate, you know, you mentioned I played

258
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,720
at Loyola, which is a small school in Baltimore. I like to say we're a small school, but we were

259
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,099
mighty on the field. We competed division one lacrosse. So we were a 3000 undergrad, small,

260
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,799
private Jesuit Catholic school.

261
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:25,619
But we competed with, you know, the University of North Carolina's and the University of Maryland's

262
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:31,660
and the Duke's and the Virginia's and these really great big schools. And so we were the

263
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,960
underdog in our league and we loved it. We thrived on it. I enjoy that mentality. I carry it with me

264
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,079
every day. I carry it with me in high school because I'm, you can't tell, but I'm only five

265
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,900
foot one. So I was always the smallest. I was always the runt of the litter. And so I always

266
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,799
had this chip on my shoulder and always felt like an underdog.

267
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:55,119
And so I really connected with Loyola in that way, when they were recruiting and I was making

268
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,400
a decision where to go, and I didn't have a lot of offers to be quite honest, cause

269
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,700
I'm five foot one. So I had this really strong passion at Loyola for taking me and loving

270
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,660
me. And I wanted to do all I could for them back. And it comes back to Under Armour because

271
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,299
we were in Baltimore and Kevin has started the company in Baltimore. And so, you know,

272
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,740
here's this young guy rolling up to our field and he's bringing these two guys. And we're

273
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
like, what the heck are you doing with this young guy? And he's like, what are you doing?

274
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:19,799
He's like, you know, you know what? He's running from the field. And you know, you know, he's bringing

275
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:25,559
stretchy shirts and he's giving them to our coach saying, Hey, you know, I got this new shirt. I

276
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,059
played football down the road at the university of Maryland. It like makes you feel good. It

277
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:36,660
licks the moisture off of you. Will you guys try it? So our coaches were like free gear. Sure.

278
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,940
So they're handing us these stretchy lingerie, like t-shirts. And we were just like, Oh my God,

279
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:50,980
free gear. We'll take it. So we started wearing it and we would go play, you know, Princeton and

280
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:58,160
go play Duke and go play, um, you know, all these schools up in Boston. And we line up on the circle

281
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,720
and the girl next to me would go, what are you wearing? And I'd be like, I'm wearing Under Armour.

282
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:06,920
You don't know what Under Armour is. You know, like, you don't know, like Under Armour is the

283
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,779
best. It like is the best on base layer. So we felt so special because we had something

284
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,319
that all these other big schools didn't have. So that is where my love affair with Under Armour

285
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,140
started. I really believed in the product. And for the record, he created a category,

286
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,519
right? Performance apparel did not exist. Performance footwear did. And Nike did a

287
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:35,720
great job with the waffle trainer and wonderful, but we were wearing champion cotton men's t-shirts

288
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,579
and shorts and champion cotton men's sweats and sweatpants. There was no synthetic fibers. There

289
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:42,920
was no more.

290
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:50,920
That did not exist. And so it truly was an amazing product that worked. And so I wore it all through

291
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,220
college. Um, when I got out, I coached for a year. I was a collegiate coach at Towson down the road

292
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,920
and I had made a relationship with the Under Armour guys at that point. So there were three

293
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,839
kind of co-owners, Kevin and two, two partners. And one of the partners called me and said, Hey,

294
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:11,960
I heard you're taking a job at Towson. That's fabulous. Can we sponsor you guys? Can I give

295
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,920
your girls base layer?

296
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,640
And I was like, sure. Like we'll take free gear. We're a college team. We don't have anything.

297
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,619
And so we, we played a season and I realized quickly, I was, I love to play the sport. I

298
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:31,059
wasn't ready to be a spectator. So I didn't enjoy the coaching side of it at that point. And

299
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:36,000
Ryan called me back and said, Hey, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna give you another year

300
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,619
sponsorship. And I said, Ryan, that's great, but I don't think coaching's for me. I'm going to try

301
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:42,279
something else.

302
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,940
And he was like, Oh, great. He's like, well, would you come and interview with us? Because

303
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:55,059
we are a company of men and we need some females to come in and help go talk to other college

304
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:00,480
teams, women's teams, soccer, field hockey, softball, because right now our whole division

305
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,359
is men and we're having a hard time breaking through. And so I was like, sure. I'll come

306
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,180
interview. I actually went and interviewed at a lacrosse company and was offered a job with them

307
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,619
um,

308
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:17,240
for double the pay and a better at a better title for the record. But I went to Under Armour,

309
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,200
I interviewed with them and the DNA match was just so incredible. It was like, I knew the

310
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,420
product was great. It was a bunch of young, hungry, underdog kind of guys that were fighting,

311
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:34,880
you know, these behemoths out West. And I was like, you know what, you offer me half the money

312
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,599
and no title, but dang it, like I'm in. And that was the start of it. And so I spent,

313
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:47,539
um, my first few years there, cold calling every division one football school on the East coast.

314
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:53,299
So I would show up, walk down the corridors of universities. So I was, I was cold calling at a

315
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:58,160
very young age, which is very intimidating. And I'd walked in and down the hallways and I'd knock

316
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,279
on the doors and I'd say, Hey, I just happened to be in town. I'm with Under Armour. Have you

317
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,539
ever heard of this stuff? And, you know, I talked to the softball coach and the women's lacrosse

318
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,400
coach and the field hockey coach and the baseball coach and the softball coach. And, you know,

319
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,599
these guys, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,

320
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,279
people at that time were like, man, I've never heard of this. And no one's ever called on me

321
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:24,799
before because at that era, these big university deals did not exist. It was very much the football

322
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,799
team got whatever they wanted and everyone else just was ignored. So we spent a lot of time

323
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:36,799
nurturing relationships with people that don't usually have someone call on them and did that

324
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,599
for three years, made incredible relationships, sold to schools.

325
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,579
That you would not, you know, would have never had anything to do with us. And then

326
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:51,119
that eventually turned into outfitting entire universities and coming at it from a marketing

327
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:57,119
side point, you know, standpoint instead of, of sales. But it was just such an incredible

328
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,700
environment to learn in because everyone was learning together. We were so young

329
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,559
and just so hungry. It was so cool and such an underdog, which I totally related to.

330
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,339
What a brilliant, brilliant story. And to a global,

331
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:15,519
success. And as you said, starting with great product, but I love the way you told that of

332
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,599
literally cold calling door to door and building an incredible business on the back of it.

333
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:31,079
We all are born different. As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks,

334
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:42,339
uniquely our own. Charting our life's course. No one sees an idea, opinion or opportunity like you.

335
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,960
And no one sees you like VU. Victoria University. Uniquely you.

336
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,740
My name's Gabrielle. I'm studying law. What made me want to get into law is I guess the reward you

337
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,160
get after the feelings that you get for helping other people. I'm really passionate about making

338
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,500
sure that people have that voice, especially for people that don't feel like they can be heard. And

339
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,880
that's something that's really important to me. I have quite deep personal values. So it was really

340
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,559
important to me to find a university that aligns with those values. And VU is that for me.

341
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,140
Love you to check out our signature program, Alita Connect. Several hundred people from a

342
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,259
range of backgrounds, sport, industry, social venture, the arts, come together

343
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,599
in groups of five to six to learn, to connect and collaborate. We'd love to speak to you.

344
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,299
Vanessa Ford, Chief Operating Officer at Kukua.

345
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:42,500
The Alita Connect experience for me has been transformational. I met people that I would

346
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,480
never have met from totally different spheres. And it's very basic. It's all about relationships.

347
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,779
It's all about how we communicate. And what the Alita Connect group does that is so powerful

348
00:30:53,779 --> 00:31:00,539
is when you bring two people from two totally different worlds together, there's no ego.

349
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,740
It just leaves room for the real you. And I think that's what Alita gave me was bringing

350
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,140
back the real me and really connecting to my own leadership style.

351
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,900
We have this saying that success leaves clues. And I love sitting down and hearing your story and

352
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,000
the sort of patterns that emerge from different leaders in different environments. And this idea

353
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,019
of self-leadership, I want to ask you, how do you make you feel your best so that you can lead

354
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,599
others? What do you do specifically for yourself so that you can fill your own cup up?

355
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:39,500
Yeah, I'm very much in the weeds type of leader. So not micromanaging because that's different.

356
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm in the weeds in that I really,

357
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,880
like knowing what you're doing. And so you feel like you're being supported because I've been

358
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:57,039
there or I understand what you're going through. And so my coach in college, who is this legendary

359
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,180
woman, the late Diane Jeffy Akins, who you've probably heard Stacey, one of your co-workers

360
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:08,079
talk about. She was just an incredible mentor along with my parents. And Mike, she's really

361
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,660
been the most influential person in my life. And she had this one saying, and, and she,

362
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,700
she would say it about me and it made me so proud. She would say, Suzanne walks the walk

363
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,019
and she talks the talk. And I really live by that. Like, I really want everyone, whether they're on

364
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:31,400
my team or I'm working with them to know that like, I'm not above anything. I will be in the

365
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,200
trenches with you. We are doing this together. Like, how do we get through this? How do we make

366
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,660
mistakes together? How do we get wins together? But just this real team mentality and this,

367
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,259
this confidence that, you know, I, I can imagine it because I've been there or I can imagine it

368
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,980
because I can, I can empathize with you. And, and so that, that's how I look at leadership.

369
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,240
I've also, especially in the world of Under Armour, I just was always patient

370
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,039
because I think patience is something that helps you stay in the moment. And so I looked at Under

371
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,660
Armour, like every opportunity was a chance to learn something. And I think that's, I think,

372
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:18,119
something that I, I had no idea what I was doing. You know, like you can go to college and get a

373
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:25,859
degree, but that's not a substitute for like doing it and living in it. And so with, with Under Armour,

374
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,299
I just was incredibly patient and really took joy in all the different roles I had. I mean,

375
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:37,740
over 17 years, you really grow and change and do different things. And so I would say walking the

376
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,640
walk, talking to talk, and then being patient is really, um, what, what I stay true to.

377
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,599
Yeah. I love that concept of, uh, as you said, walking the walk, talking to talk. What's the

378
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:55,319
one piece of leadership advice that you pass on the most? Um, I got it from Mike and I use it all

379
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:02,299
the time, which is be a confidence giver. Um, that doesn't mean you don't speak true and

380
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:08,000
transparent with people because I think people that want to develop and learn, you know, if they

381
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,320
truly want to develop and learn, they truly want to be coached. And that means they want

382
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,639
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

383
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,679
real feedback. So that doesn't mean you're getting false confidence. That means that you're

384
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,840
giving people transparent feedback. That's constructive, but then you're doing it in a way

385
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:30,239
that if you see potential in them, that breeds confidence. And, you know, I was a very coachable

386
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,699
young woman, very coachable in high school. I was very coachable in college. And that's because I

387
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:41,639
loved getting feedback. And I always knew that if a coach was taking the time to correct me

388
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,619
or work with me, I was going to be a coachable young woman. And I was going to be a coachable

389
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:42,780
young woman. And I always knew that if a coach was taking the time to correct me,

390
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,920
it meant that I had potential and they saw something in me. When a coach ignores you,

391
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,900
that means they're done, right? They've tried and they didn't get through to you.

392
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,000
They don't see the value in wasting more time on you. And so I always feel like when I,

393
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:03,260
you know, find someone that I'm working with and I can coach them or give them confidence or help

394
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:11,500
them, you know, if they're really coachable, they want that and they embrace it. And even at

395
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:11,760
Under Armour, I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

396
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:11,780
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

397
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:18,300
like i love getting feedback good bad ugly all of it because i just feel like it means that there's

398
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,980
something there's potential in me to continue to get better and i i'm very coachable with that and

399
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:29,880
and i also think that you know getting transparent feedback is healthy and that people that really

400
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,820
want to grow and learn appreciate it even when it's hard i love that the idea of being a confidence

401
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:40,900
giver we've all been under coaches or leaders that are confidence takers and that uh is debilitating

402
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,500
as you said not uh false uh feedback or not avoiding it but i love the way you described

403
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,539
that i want to talk to you about vision you've been involved in projects that have got a big

404
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:56,539
vision under armor was a huge bold plan when you think about it and q collar is addressing an

405
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:02,300
enormous challenge in the world of sport at the moment how do you go about not only setting a

406
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,079
vision like that but being able to deliver that within your team being authentic your vision has

407
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,380
to be authentic that was the best thing about under armor

408
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:17,059
everything we did was authentic authentic down to the i mean it was just rooted in sport by real

409
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:24,079
athletes that truly understood the culture even at q collar our vision is very much based in

410
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,340
authenticity and by that i mean we do not pay people to speak about the product we don't pay

411
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:36,320
people to say they like it our journey has been slow and has been up a steep mountain

412
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,360
and part of it is slow because we have been very very

413
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,440
committed to finding athletes who want to understand the problem want to address the

414
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,440
problem believe in the science and the technology and then truly believe that wearing it is important

415
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,159
to them and it's become a part of their ritual it's not something that they're paid for now

416
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,519
there are tons of marketing agreements out there um that we call transactional and they're beautiful

417
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:09,059
right like there's cars and food and drinks and all that stuff and and that those relationships

418
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,360
are wonderful and unique and i think that's what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to make sure that

419
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,500
we're not just selling things to people who need those and they do sell things our product is just

420
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,300
so unique you can't live in that world so you either love it and you believe in it and you

421
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,619
want to wear it or there's not enough money in the world to make you say you are and the analogy i use

422
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,980
and athletes like this is i say it's like me paying you to be vegan no amount of money can

423
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,659
make you turn down steak and butter because if you want to eat steak and butter you're going to eat it

424
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:39,000
now if you want to be vegan because you believe that's the best thing for your body and your

425
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,360
performance it's like you're going to be vegan and you're going to be vegan and you're going to be

426
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:46,139
a lot easier to be vegan and so i tell athletes like that's that's the nature of our business you

427
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,599
have to really believe in the device and wear the cue collar and then once you do then there's

428
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,719
sponsorship opportunities and marking opportunities for your time effort energy you know off the field

429
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:01,980
um and under armor was the same way we just found truly authentic athletes right lindsey vaughn and

430
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:09,099
michael phelps and god jordan spieth they were truly steph curry i mean he was truly an authentic

431
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,360
athlete in that he was a true authentic athlete and he was a true authentic athlete and he was

432
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,780
like he believed in the product believed in the brand and that's who you that's who you hit your

433
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,219
wagon to um the other side of that is that you can have great vision and still make mistakes which

434
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:24,440
i have plenty of great mistake stories i could share with you um you can have great vision and

435
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,239
still fall short and have mistakes but if if the vision and the authenticity is there you can get

436
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:37,019
beyond it and you can rebound but you have to be rooted in that that true authentic relationship

437
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,900
when i sit down and have these conversations i find

438
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,800
people like you're intentionally curious because of the way that you are and that's what's led to a

439
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,480
lot of success can you share is there a late latest rabbit hole of curiosity that's taking

440
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,940
you somewhere of interest that you could share with us god i i have really gotten into wearable

441
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,980
tech and it's almost like become too much of an exception of obsession you know the aura rings

442
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,099
the heart rate monitors sleep i mean it's like i'm checking my phone every day i mean like

443
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,360
how much i'm checking my phone every day i'm checking my phone every day i'm checking my phone

444
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:17,139
how much how much of it was good you know my heart rate was it elevated so like the whole

445
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:24,000
wearable tech thing is very addicting um which i think the companies know and i think especially

446
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,340
women of my age you know um i've gotten very into researching like creatine so i think this is so

447
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:38,380
funny when i was at loyola so early 2000s um we after weightlifting we had a trainer and he would

448
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,360
give us creatine and we'd be chugging it and we'd be chugging it and we'd be chugging it and we'd be

449
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,679
chugging creatine and like you know we're like bench pressing 100 pounds and like you know we

450
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,139
were just like rocks you know and then we kind of all got a little bit like um creatine is making

451
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:57,380
us get big like this isn't right we shouldn't be doing creatine now 25 years later it's like

452
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:04,659
women drink eat creatine and i'm like it's coming full circle so i have definitely um have been

453
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:09,940
diving down the creatine hole as well right now yeah i remember the uh the creatine uh

454
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:17,139
as well of time that's interesting that it's come back uh full circle and um yeah i've a young uh

455
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:22,780
athlete in my house uh doing the same um i want to talk to you about this idea of uh collaboration

456
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,420
we're really passionate about we love this quote the cost of leadership is time and i look at you

457
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,440
as a mother of two boys you've got your work at cucola and the demands of life how do you balance

458
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,199
that all out and still uh collaborate and and foster the culture that you want in all the

459
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,360
environments that you're in yeah i think it's a really good question and i think it's a really good

460
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:47,340
one i um probably right after i had my children i realized very quickly you cannot have it all

461
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:53,239
and that is a false narrative that people say you can have it all just go have it all everything

462
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:59,619
will be just the way you want it to be in reality you need to prioritize what is important to you

463
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:08,280
and not everything can be important and so i make very distinct decisions on what is going to be a

464
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,340
priority and what is not now i'm not a teacher i'm not a teacher i'm not a teacher i'm not a teacher

465
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,679
they can change different phases of life. Different things can phase in and phase out.

466
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,420
Nothing's written in stone. But I make those priorities clear to myself, my teammates who I

467
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,679
work with, my family, my children, you know, Mike, like we're very clear on, you know, right now in

468
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,599
our phase, maybe we're not going to have a bunch of home cooked meals, right? That's going to have

469
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,840
to be neglected because we're going to have to be working on calls in the evening. But that doesn't

470
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,739
mean we can't have great family time. We'll find it in a different way. So we're just very clear on

471
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:46,559
priorities. Holidays are another one, right? Like Mike's season has always been basketball. So we're

472
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:52,019
always right through Thanksgiving and Christmas in the heart of holidays. Well, sometimes you have

473
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:58,380
to sacrifice the holidays, but you make it up in different ways. And so I've just been uber clear

474
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,260
about make priorities, communicate with those around you what those priorities are. You know,

475
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,820
once you do that, you're going to be able to do a lot of things. And so I've just been

476
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,539
you have a clear head and a clear heart because you know that you've made a decision and, you know,

477
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:15,760
you're not trying to be fake and fill in the gaps that you can't with everybody.

478
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:23,099
So priorities for me are just super important. And that leads to the other dimension I want

479
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,599
to talk to you about. And that's the crystal clear communication, which is what you alluded

480
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,699
to, isn't it? That you can substitute some things on the basis that you're really clear

481
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:34,860
with your communication. Have you got a mantra about the way you've communicated in

482
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,800
all the spaces?

483
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:47,579
Yeah. So I have so many great mentors. I had one mentor who he was an Under Armour and he was a

484
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,840
great salesman and great marketing, but really had a sales knack. And he would always say to me,

485
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,000
most people make the mistake because they talk too much. Say less, listen more and say less.

486
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,340
Let people be heard, empathize with people.

487
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:13,960
And then once you get what you came for, get out, shut up. People don't want you to monopolize

488
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,179
their time. Be respectful of their time. And so I found that early on in my days at UA and has

489
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:27,980
stayed with me. It is more about listening. A good communicator can listen, actually hear what the

490
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,219
client or the person you're working with is in need of, where the gaps are, and then find a way

491
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,320
to help be a solution. And I think that's really important. And I think that's really important.

492
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,659
And you do that in real life too. You do that with your kids. You do that with your husband,

493
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,900
your spouse. You really listen to what's going on before you have an opinion, before you say

494
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,920
something. Yeah. Great bit of wisdom to share as well. And it's just often people talk about that

495
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,719
great listening is the ultimate form of communication. Suzanne, who's been the greatest

496
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:03,179
leader in your life? So many great leaders. I do have to say, Diane, Jeffy Akins, my coach in

497
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,239
college. I just, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say,

498
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:04,320
I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say,

499
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,380
I have such a soft spot for team athletics and collegiate athletics in particular. It was such a

500
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:18,920
pivotal time in my life of figuring out who you are and kind of growing up and realizing that you

501
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,420
can be a part of something really big and not have a personal agenda, right? It wasn't about you

502
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:32,300
or yourself. It was about the team. And so the lessons that she taught me about that just have

503
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
carried me through life in so many different ways. And I think that's really important.

504
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,980
But the other side of it is she was such a powerful woman. And to that point in my life,

505
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:48,940
I had not seen a lot of what I call CEO women. She was a CEO. She ran a team. She ran camps in

506
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,860
the summer. She ran her team like a business. She had to put together her roster. She had to

507
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:00,119
put together her staff. I mean, it was a full-time job and she had four kids. And to see a woman like

508
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,219
that as a young lady, it was like, my mind was like blown. And I think that's one of the things

509
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:12,719
I was like, oh my gosh, this woman, she is a boss. And I had had wonderful females in my life

510
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,719
before in high school, but you didn't see them like that. You weren't with them 24 hours a day

511
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:24,280
like we were with Diane. And so I just have to put her on that pedestal. She was just an incredible

512
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,539
influence in my life. And Suzanne, I understand she was going through a significant cancer battle

513
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:34,099
right throughout that time as well. To think of the influence you had on you and so

514
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:40,360
many of the athletes under her care. She's a mother of four, running businesses and putting

515
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,199
that together. It's incredible, isn't it? And that must have been a heartbreaking time as well

516
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,559
to see the person that was that great mentor struggling at the time as well.

517
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:55,059
She, Luke, she taught me the ultimate lesson, which I carry with me every day. And that lesson

518
00:45:55,059 --> 00:46:00,820
was perspective. Something you cannot learn as a young person when everything is going right.

519
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,980
But here we were, 20 years old,

520
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:08,260
our whole goal in life was to win a national championship. Nothing else mattered, right?

521
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,780
Here's a 40-year-old woman with four children, dying of a brain tumor, her fourth one in 10 years.

522
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:21,400
And she would come to practice every day and just be like, ladies, take a minute. Let's look at the

523
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,380
sunrise at 6 a.m. Ladies, you know, let's all take a moment to really thank each other for

524
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:34,199
how hard we worked today. So here's a woman that could have been angry and sad and pissed off.

525
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:36,199
She was driving so hard and pissed off that she was dealing with this illness.

526
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,639
And then she said something to us that, you know, the day she told us she got sick December leading

527
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:48,199
into our season. You know, we're a spring sport. So she called us all into a meeting in December.

528
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:53,480
We're about to go on winter break for a month. She said, ladies, I have to tell you something.

529
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:59,599
I got a report back from the doctors and my brain tumor is back. And this time it'sсли Warmeling

530
00:46:59,599 --> 00:46:59,880
and it will kill me. And I was like, you know, I'm in a hospital. I'm in a hospital. I'm in a Powell alibaba.

531
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,980
And this time it's inoperable. And it is it will kill me.

532
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,159
so we're in this room our mouths are agape we're about you know everyone's crying

533
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:12,019
and she stopped and she said but I don't want any of you to feel sorry for me

534
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:19,400
because I get to say goodbye to all the people I love in my life I get to hug my children

535
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,280
I get to be with them the folks that went to work on 9-11 had no idea they would never see

536
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,460
their families again those people we feel sorry for we do not feel sorry for people like me

537
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:37,860
I get to live my life to the fullest that was her message to us I mean talk about perspective

538
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:44,980
like I just changed the way I faced every bit of adversity in my life you know you're sitting

539
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,760
in traffic really you're gonna be that upset about it you know what is the you're going through a

540
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,880
hard day is it really that hard is it really that's you know it's like you just learn to flip

541
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,699
things and instead of feeling sorry or thinking it's the end of the world you think

542
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,119
a million people out there that have it worse than me like what an extraordinary extraordinary

543
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,880
perspective isn't it sounds like a remarkable woman to have someone like that in your life and

544
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,400
the way you talk about her um is incredible isn't it the legacy that lives on through

545
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,639
that as a as a 20 year old to have that uh is quite extraordinary we are a bit obsessed with

546
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,059
this idea of collaboration in our world of a leader and what happens when you put great people

547
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:30,800
together from diverse backgrounds and the magic that often happens you've been able to collaborate

548
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,300
with some remarkable people in the world of Under Armour and what you're doing with Q Collar and

549
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,920
your own athletic career and seeing that everywhere has there been someone you thought wow

550
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,460
in any of your passions in life I'd love to connect and collaborate with that person is

551
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,920
there a name that springs to mind you know the thing I would tell you is that and you've probably

552
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,440
seen this more than not there are so many more people you you have so much more in common with

553
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,219
people than you think you think you're so different or your worlds are so different and then when you

554
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:01,440
get to talking to them you realize oh my gosh we're so much the same like it's just and it's

555
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,599
and sport is that red thread it just carries through which is just why it's such a a brilliant

556
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:15,739
brilliant thing to be a part of that's a great question you know I I would love to be a part of

557
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:23,239
some of these women team athletes National Women's Soccer League you know we the U.S.

558
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:27,480
national team I would love to work with with some of these athletes at that level

559
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,239
I have an incredible amount of jealousy for Olympic sport athletes

560
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:37,199
because when I was growing up lacrosse was not an Olympic sport so the dream of being an Olympian

561
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:45,659
I never got to you know work towards and so I look at you know Olympians in just this oh you know

562
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:51,980
amazing light that they get to represent their country which is just such an honor and I'm so

563
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,500
patriotic and so I love to do some collabs with some Olympic teams some you know national team

564
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,440
soccer players we've had a chance you know to get to work with some of these women team athletes

565
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,980
get with some of these these athletes and just really be a part of the world we at least fake it

566
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,860
for a little bit well it's been a great pleasure to spend some time with you Suzanne thanks for

567
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:17,440
taking the time the work that you and the team at Kukola are doing may be life-changing for many

568
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,320
people around the globe I'm sure there's a lot of interest in it I can hear your passion for it
