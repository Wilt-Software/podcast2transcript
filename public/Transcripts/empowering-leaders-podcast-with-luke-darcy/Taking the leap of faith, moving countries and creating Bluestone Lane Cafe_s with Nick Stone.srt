00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:10,160
Our next guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is a brilliant story, Nicholas Stone.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,320
You're going to get an enormous amount of wisdom from this chat.

3
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:17,899
He'll talk about his sense of well-being and connection for his locals, as he calls them,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,320
at the cafes, Bluestone Lane, that he has successfully created around the US.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,440
And referring to his staff as teammates, you're going to hear Nick Stone talk about being

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,000
on track for a really successful time in banking, but he bet the farm on his cafe venture, Bluestone

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
Lane, that has been a great Australian hospitality success story.

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,759
He talks about the importance of focusing on what you can control if you want to execute

9
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,520
your idea.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,020
And you'll hear about the celebrity A-list customers that turbocharged Bluestone Lane

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,560
in the US, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and the incredible Malcolm

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,219
Gladwell becoming a daily customer at his Bluestone Lane cafes.

Nicholas Stone began his professional career as an Australian rules footballer playing

47
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,610
20 games for Hawthorne and St. Kilda from 2002 to 2005.

48
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,430
His next chapter included more than a decade in corporate finance, including an extended

49
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,530
stint with the ANZ based in New York City.

50
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:02,050
It was while living in the Big Apple and working in banking, Nick started his side hustle,

51
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,849
opening his first Bluestone Lane coffee shop in midtown Manhattan.

52
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,930
Bluestone has expanded to more than 60 stores across the country.

53
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:15,090
He has been backed by sophisticated US billionaire investors and is truly an awesome international

54
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,969
Australian hospitality success story.

55
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:18,870
Nick, it's always great to see you.

56
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:19,610
Thanks for joining me today.

57
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,189
Pleasure, Luke.

58
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,770
Thank you.

59
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,069
Yeah, great to be here.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,569
And you obviously were in the States recently, so I'm ashamed we couldn't catch up there,

61
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,289
but great to connect.

62
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,770
Well, that is funny, mate, isn't it?

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,030
I was up in Seattle, a town I'd never been to before, and any time I'm in the US, you

64
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,550
go, I've got to find a place to live.

65
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,650
I've got to find a place to live.

66
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:38,789
I've got to find a place to live.

67
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,930
I've got to find a place to live.

68
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,289
And I sent you a message and said, mate, I'm struggling here.

69
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,949
I'm going to have to go to the dark side and buy a Starbucks coffee.

70
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,110
And you said, mate, you're in the home of Starbucks.

71
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:52,689
We haven't quite gone to Seattle to take on Starbucks there, but maybe in the future,

72
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,870
Nick.

73
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,830
In the future.

74
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,050
I was actually up there a few months ago.

75
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,889
There's a new Gordon Ramsay production that's about to come out.

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,569
It's a bit like The Apprentice, but for culinary candidates.

77
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,930
And I'm actually one of the guest judges on this program.

78
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,789
And it's going to air in a few, it's going to air in a couple of months in the States.

79
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:20,949
And I think they had, without a doubt, either Howard Schultz or the CEO designate penciled

80
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,329
in to be the judge.

81
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,629
But I got this late call and I had to be there within a matter of days.

82
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,949
And sure enough, I was the ring in.

83
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,870
But yeah, in the heart of Starbucks, it's good that I was there.

84
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,069
And ultimately, we've got to put a plan to flag on the ground and get a blue sign open.

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,509
Well, I love that.

86
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,550
That's the level you're at now, isn't it?

87
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,689
You get the call from the production team from Gordon Ramsay.

88
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,870
Come up and get involved.

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,149
You look at the numbers, Nick.

90
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,129
I love the courage of what you did.

91
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,529
75% of hospitality ventures in New York City fail within five years.

92
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,189
You'd never worked a day at hospitality in your life.

93
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,170
Pretty bold move when you look at it to open Bluestone Lane right in the middle of Manhattan.

94
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,610
Tell us about your thought process.

95
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,389
Yeah, repeating it back, it does get me questioning my decision making.

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,389
But yeah.

97
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:11,589
Ultimately, Bluestone was created because I missed it myself.

98
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,050
It was out of self-necessity.

99
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:20,790
When I moved to the States in 2010, I was at business school and I had an opportunity to work on a project.

100
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,069
And I was thinking about a tech-based business.

101
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:30,449
But ultimately, I settled on coffee because I just thought that Australians, we do it so well, this independent coffee culture.

102
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,689
We'd proven that Starbucks and that chain mentality couldn't scale in our home market.

103
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:37,449
And yeah.

104
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:44,470
I just thought there's this opportunity based on the success of, and the limited, honestly, the limited competition in my eyes.

105
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:57,129
Because Starbucks, even though at that point in time probably had about 20,000 locations, it just, their proposition was so different from what I was accustomed to or what we as Australians are regularly accustomed to.

106
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,870
So, you know, ultimately started becoming a student of the industry.

107
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,769
And I had a very myopic view that it was fraught with danger.

108
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,129
And the mortality.

109
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:17,670
The mortality rate was very high, but ultimately decided to do one as a bit of an experiment while I was still in banking.

110
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,069
And then it just sort of developed from there.

111
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:28,709
So, you know, we're still learning and iterating, but we couldn't have forecasted what was to come over the past sort of nine, nearly 10 years.

112
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:37,069
And with COVID and the change of the way people, how they work and where they work, and we've had a lot of other fascinating and exhilarating experiences.

113
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,310
But, you know, it's something I'm very proud of and grateful for the team and what they've put together.

114
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,449
It's an incredible story, Nick, all around.

115
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,470
And you're right.

116
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:59,209
You look at the Americans consume their coffee, probably Dunkin' Donuts initially, and then Starbucks became this, you know, behemoth, but a very different experience to what you brought to the table.

117
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,050
An Australian coffee brand, when you think about it, it's an unlikely play, isn't it, for Americans to get their head around?

118
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,490
Why do you think it's worked in the U.S.?

119
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,129
Why do you think you've been able to get this cult following?

120
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,149
Well, if you think about the history of coffee in the States, this was very much a drip, drip coffee.

121
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:27,209
So the big one litre, one gallon jug that percolated, that would sit on the desk and it's played out in all these sitcoms and comics that we know of.

122
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,930
Ultimately, Starbucks were the one that were the catalyst towards this espresso movement.

123
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,490
And that happened in the 80s, sort of in the late 80s, 90s, Howard Schultz.

124
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:45,430
Went to Italy and decided, I'm going to partner with this group and convince them that retail is the pathway forward.

125
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,649
Starbucks was originally just a coffee bean retailer.

126
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,449
You go in to buy coffee beans and grind to make coffee at home.

127
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:03,529
But Schultz had this view about building these cafes, which really were based upon the Italian experience that he fell in love with.

128
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,829
So for us, we didn't have a drip coffee culture in Australia.

129
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,389
We were.

130
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:07,490
We were.

131
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,529
We had a tea based drinking culture, which was influenced from the British.

132
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:23,170
And then, you know, if you think about what happened pre and post World War Two, we had mass migration from West and Southern Europe and they brought their espresso machines, the Italians and the Greeks and the Maltese.

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,310
And and ultimately the coffee culture sort of began.

134
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:37,389
We shifted and then it's just continued to reimagine itself with the introduction of more sophisticated breakfast foods, lunch foods and really coffee.

135
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:43,149
As we know it in Australia and how I think about it is really just the ability to connect with someone.

136
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:51,909
Coffee shops facilitate connection and it's just such an incredible social medium and it's something that's more accessible.

137
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:54,190
It's daytime, not alcohol.

138
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,129
It's often cheaper and we've just made it our own.

139
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:06,509
And that independent movement has has had so much creativity and that that was the opportunity I saw in the states that the consumption of coffee was super high.

140
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,190
You didn't have to.

141
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,590
Educate the consumer about drinking coffee.

142
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:20,950
It was just appreciating it in a different way and introducing them to different different food that can complement coffee and then designing spaces that foster that atmosphere of human connection.

143
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:28,950
And that's one thing the Australians do exceptionally well, that that eye for detail on the atmospheric elements, that the vibe.

144
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,750
And that was something that I really thought with Bluestone.

145
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,129
That's how we can introduce our brand in a more powerful way.

146
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:43,129
By these environments where people feel that it's aspirational, yet it's still accessible.

147
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:57,590
And that's probably the underpin the secret of Bluestone building this premium brand that stands for so much more than just being product orientated, that it's really about the way we make people feel through service and hospitality.

148
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:05,570
I hadn't really thought about when you just expressed that way post-World War Two and the mass Italian Greek migration, the Maltese community.

149
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,129
And as you said, they brought their machines.

150
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:07,529
Didn't they?

151
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,090
And we know those families.

152
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,289
It's a city that you and I have lived in for a long period of time.

153
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:19,309
And my great friends, the dim of Tina's had mocha pan coffee, which was one of the first Lavazza, you know, was a famous brand.

154
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:24,409
And you probably realize that that started, as you said, this whole community based thing.

155
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:27,230
It isn't so loyal to your local coffee shop here in Melbourne.

156
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:37,129
I recently changed walking paths and I've got this guilt around not going back to my my latte from from because I want to say hello and connect.

157
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,269
And you feel like you owe them something because of the joy they give you.

158
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:46,970
And you brought that to the US, didn't you, with the flat white had never been heard of before.

159
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,350
And then also, you know, avocado on toast, stuff that we, you know, as routine here.

160
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,029
That was revolutionary in the US, wasn't it?

161
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,370
Well, that's right.

162
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:01,370
You know, when when we launched the avocado smash in 2013, no one, no one knew what we were talking about.

163
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,330
Now it's ubiquitous.

164
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,889
So I think that's a signal of how successful it's been.

165
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,830
But same with the flat white.

166
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:13,669
When it was put on the core menu at Starbucks, the acknowledgment from the green siren is pretty impressive.

167
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:20,169
Honestly, thirty four thousand stores may decide to add the flat white, which is a beverage really only found in Australia, New Zealand.

168
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,110
It's it's pretty amazing.

169
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,769
And that focus on being a local, not having customers on having locals.

170
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:36,730
And that's what you're talking about, Luke, that that relationship, you know, in Australia, making good coffee is just a ticket to participate.

171
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,230
It's not it's not an element that's going to necessarily underpin your success.

172
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,870
And you have to have good coffee.

173
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,990
That's just a lay down there.

174
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,509
But you really want to foster that relationships.

175
00:11:48,509 --> 00:12:00,289
And I found that it was pretty transactional through the commercial success of Starbucks that that you can just focus so much more on being on investing in that relationship with your locals where, you know, the name, face and order.

176
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,149
And I used to walk out of where we worked on Collins Street.

177
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:05,409
And there'd be 15 coffee shops.

178
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,509
We'd have a coffee shop.

179
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,509
We'd get in a couple of hundred meters and everyone had their had their local and they would advocate for them unsolicitedly.

180
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:20,350
You would and you would really have to convince someone to come with you to yours because everyone feels like they didn't want to cheat on their local.

181
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,690
So, you know, those those elements, those artisanal elements are existing in the states.

182
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:36,190
When I moved there, I could see what was going on with the class fitness revolution, just the way that people would would do anything to get in a certain soul cycle classes.

183
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,529
There's one class that my wife and I used to take 7 a.m.

184
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,610
every Tuesday in NoHo, and it would release the class seven days in advance.

185
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:57,610
And if you didn't secure your spot within 30 minutes of that going, going live, you weren't coming in because people were using it as a way, yes, the endorphins of getting fit and working on your health and fitness.

186
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,889
But it was really that social that that that social media bumping into each other before you go in the class, the smiles on the on the treadmill.

187
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,850
The jokes, the music, the chat post class that, you know, those things that bring people together.

188
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,350
It's just so critically important.

189
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:34,769
And and right now, you know, if we think about our real purpose at Bluestone and I truly feel it is to be this human connection, this this this community where we bring people together and make them feel like they're part of something bigger and try to address some of the biggest societal issues, particularly with young people, is about isolation and sadness and loneliness.

190
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,830
And what's the.

191
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,230
Better place to go and connect with someone and have that ritual.

192
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,070
It's going to get a coffee.

193
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:54,230
It's just amazing how it can liberate the way that you feel and just give you a sense of being part of something larger than just the problems or whatever's going on in your your own discreet life.

194
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,429
It's it's funny you mentioned the SoulCycle craze that took off in America.

195
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,389
She sent you an email and said, Hey, can we push it back?

196
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:04,750
Because I've got my spin class this morning, which I even say those words out loud.

197
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,710
And I'm thinking, have I been reduced?

198
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:11,370
reduced from someone who used to exercise for a living to a spin class but a great mate of mine

199
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,350
started the spin kings he's on the board at St Kilda after you know Shane Warren's tragic

200
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,190
passing and said no we got to get our mates together and get healthy and it's that community

201
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,090
and and connection and you're sitting on a bike with you know a dozen mates and you're having a

202
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,049
laugh and you as you said you're connecting and community one of your investors and you've done

203
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:37,009
incredible job of raising capital along the way uh Nick and to take on that sophisticated level

204
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:42,210
of investor the owner of the Miami Dolphins Stephen Ross who also was a big shareholder

205
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,070
in Equinox Fitness and SoulCycle can you tell us about you know that that comes with a level

206
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,309
of accountability I assume when you take money off people who are uh pretty good at uh at what

207
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,009
they do what's that experience been like well there's a there's a level of accountability for

208
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,029
for any dollar you raise whether it's from Steve

209
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:05,649
and and Matt or uh so many of my friends and family that kicked in in the first time we

210
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,289
raised $350,000 you know I that's something I take very seriously and there is a lot of

211
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:16,830
responsibility and and we've had some really touch and go moments in COVID we lost 87% of

212
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:22,490
our revenue in two weeks and the amount of operating leverage or fixed costs in our business

213
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:29,690
to try and deal with such a deceleration of revenue is super hard but as it relates to

214
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,009
Steve

215
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:37,809
and and and Matt where they are the co-founders of RSE Ventures uh they you know Matt approached me

216
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:45,490
back in uh 2017 actually and and uh he was asking to meet and I didn't really know who Matt Higgins

217
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,809
was and I was probably a bit naive honestly and I didn't know a lot about Steve I knew about Related

218
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:56,210
which is the largest landlord in New York and but I just didn't know Steve was the chairman founder

219
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,009
of it and that they owned Equinox which owns SoulCycle and I didn't know that Steve was the

220
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:00,529
founder of Equinox and I didn't know that Steve was the founder of Equinox so I just didn't know

221
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:00,870
that Steve was the founder of Equinox so I just didn't know that Steve was the founder of Equinox

222
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,470
and that they'd have a ton of different investments across hospitality uh you're talking

223
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,929
Mamafuku, Milk Bar and Pizza, Bluestone, um Magnolia Cupcakes and then you have investments

224
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:20,509
in technology they were the first check-in to Vayner Gary Vaynerchuk's business uh and all of

225
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:28,570
his different levels he's branched off in um Steve owns the Miami Dolphins renovated the stadium

226
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,009
got the Superbowl there and he's been a big supporter of the Miami Dolphins and he's been a big supporter of the Miami Dolphins

227
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:36,029
the hard rock stadium now they have the f1 grand prix they have the miami open tennis there like

228
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:41,710
he's real visionary and then of course related which has been the largest uh private real estate

229
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:48,429
deal in u.s history in hudson yards on the west side of manhattan so he's a pretty just incredible

230
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:55,230
person and takes a lot of risk and he's a huge believer in entrepreneurs and when i met matt we

231
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:02,830
had he he met me downstairs we used to have our office above a store in lower manhattan at uh down

232
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,230
in uh water street and uh right near wall street and he walked in and i didn't realize he was

233
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,269
standing in the space and the and the store was a disaster there's just people everywhere and like

234
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:18,910
the staff i won't play the right music i won't wear the right aprons there was no engagement it

235
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,430
was sort of like oh god you know what do i do here and then matt said hi nick i'm matt higgins and i

236
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,029
haven't and i and he clearly felt a bit frustrated and i'm saying you know like everything's about

237
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:35,230
the connection you know it's not about the product and we ended up going upstairs and chatting for

238
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,430
probably two hours and uh we just clicked honestly i think he saw some alignment and values he saw

239
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:49,309
that i left uh at that stage a pretty you know on the track for a pretty successful career in banking

240
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:55,069
and i was willing to bet the farm to to grow something i was super passionate about this

241
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:55,230
is an investment we've got a great around it and he said he's been with me for over a decade so i'm

242
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,150
australian coffee culture in the u.s and um you know there was a bit of a story that that we had

243
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,609
a great meeting and then i got a text message i think later that night or the next day um after

244
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:12,250
i googled who matt higgins was and what he's achieved and you know pretty and now he's written

245
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,950
extraordinary book called burn the boats but um he said uh you know can you can you come to miami

246
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,990
on um on monday and i said oh yeah i can go to miami and sure enough uh the you know i had the

247
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,369
opportunity to be flown down there and uh pick up picked up at the airport and i was taken straight

248
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:37,890
to the game and when i got out there was someone to chaperone me that took me into the stadium

249
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,869
and straight through onto the ground and she gave me a pass and said yeah just hang here and we'll

250
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:47,829
come and get you and sure enough i'm standing in the middle of the field by myself it's

251
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:47,930
my

252
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:55,710
night football it's the dolphins verse um the pats the patriots and next thing tom brady walks

253
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,470
out and he's warming up standing next to me now i don't know if this is you know all part of the

254
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,869
theater but it was one of those moments like a kid from melbourne who never worked a day in

255
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:12,589
hospitality i'm standing in the middle of uh hard rock stadium watching the greatest of all time

256
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,009
warm up next to me and then i went into steve's suite and had the chance to uh watch the game

257
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:17,809
which the

258
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:23,970
dolphins actually won so um it sort of coalesced a pretty meaningful relationship it was a great

259
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,890
first impression that's for sure and uh you know it's just gone from there what a great story it's

260
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,390
what i love about the u.s isn't it the potential and the opportunity and and i love that you know

261
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,430
you you played um you know your first job as i said was afl football but the access you get in

262
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,569
in america blows me away lucky enough to see you a couple of times when we've been over doing radio

263
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,789
the super bowl and you put a media pass on and you are the rock star you're the rock star you're the rock star

264
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:53,369
you can go inside the dressing room they get it so well where the money comes from in america

265
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:59,369
and if uh you're part of the broadcast team you get access anytime anywhere i'm not surprised you

266
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:04,789
were standing next to the great uh tom brady and i think there's i think there's just an appetite

267
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:12,589
to support for one risk and to support entrepreneurs and that has been i've been

268
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:17,150
the recipient of that in such an extraordinary way i'm so grateful for it that

269
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:25,470
that americans just love people that give it a go and even crazy ideas that maybe the you and i

270
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,349
would say there's no way i'd put a dollar into that i think if you engender a level of passion

271
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:35,829
and excitement and and you personify the dedication the requisite dedication that's

272
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:40,170
going to be required there's going to be someone who's going to back you particularly in places

273
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:46,990
like new york where it's just a you know it is truly the world city it is a confluence of

274
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:55,430
wall street and finance with the the best in the arts world the fashion world um you know

275
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:02,470
thought leaders in a whole range of different domains and people are always coming in so

276
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,069
multicultural with different perspectives and ideas and just different disruptions and

277
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:12,089
very very fortunate to be in new york because i do think it gives you a big advantage when you

278
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:16,390
want to start something particularly consumer because you have a big eight million captive

279
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,789
audience and consumerism is a big part of it and i think it's a big part of it and i think it's a

280
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,509
Schema and retail is very tangible.

281
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,509
You can touch it and feel it's easy to explain.

282
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,309
And New Yorkers love that.

283
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:27,990
They love when they can explain the difference between Australian coffee culture and the

284
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,309
U.S.

285
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,670
It wasn't that hard, you know, versus some other businesses are more challenging if you're

286
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,390
building an algorithm in the back of some of the garage, you know, and what you go to

287
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,809
market strategy is, particularly if it's like business to business, just very different.

288
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,569
But New York magnifies that in a big way.

289
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:48,410
And there's always people that want to meet you and do different things.

290
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,349
And if you think about the density of the city, it's built up for these innocuous clashes

291
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,890
between people, right?

292
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,029
If you live in an apartment and there's 100 apartments and there's 250 people living in

293
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,829
one building, there's probably a good chance you're going to bump into someone as soon

294
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:06,190
as you step out the front of your door.

295
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,250
Where in Australia, you know, you might live in a street and, you know, you step out, you

296
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,269
might not run into anyone until you go to your local coffee shop or footy training or

297
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:13,470
something.

298
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:19,650
So those innocuous incidents give you a bit of an advantage as well as starting a business.

299
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,750
Yeah, a bit like your story, isn't it?

300
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,950
One of the most sophisticated investors in the world happens to know your coffee shop

301
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,589
and you get the chance to connect in that way.

302
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,910
And I've spoken to you about this before, you know, the Australian tall poppy syndrome

303
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,289
is a real thing, isn't it?

304
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,670
Where we like, you know, Nick Stone to do well.

305
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,250
We don't want you to do too well, though, because that's, you know, we'll try and cut

306
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,170
you down a level or two.

307
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,250
And I love the term that you use and the great support you've had.

308
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,390
The koala mafia is a great term, isn't it?

309
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:50,630
The expat Australian business people that have gone over and had success in the US who

310
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,289
get that entrepreneurial spirit in America without the tall poppy syndrome and can explain

311
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,630
just how supportive that community has been.

312
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,910
And I know you're a great support to other, you know, aspiring people who come to the

313
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,150
US.

314
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,029
It's a real community, isn't it, that works over there?

315
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,569
Yeah, I definitely think it's a difference in attitude from thinking about others as

316
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:12,690
competitive threats.

317
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,890
Rather than you're part of something that is trying to educate and grow a market where

318
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,049
everyone can do well.

319
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:27,109
And I think it really came apparent to me maybe a couple of years in that there's no

320
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:27,650
competition.

321
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,470
Everything's about working together and growing the awareness in the market and that we can

322
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,069
all coexist.

323
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:38,769
And I think I took, changed my attitude from like keeping all the secrets and withholding

324
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:42,309
information just to being an open book and being an available resource.

325
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:42,569
And.

326
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,670
It's amazing when you pay it back, like the amount of people that will pay it back to

327
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:46,970
you.

328
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,890
And when you're generous, people are more generous back.

329
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,750
And I do think it's very much in the US spirit.

330
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,950
And I also think it was, it aligned with a quote that I read from Reid Hoffman when he

331
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,130
said, no one owns a good idea.

332
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:02,650
Execution is everything.

333
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,789
And I just think that's a fabulous term that everyone's had an idea about opening a coffee

334
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,650
shop in the US or a suitcase company.

335
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,890
In the US or a new shoe company in the US, like on running, but everything's about execution.

336
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,430
And what's execution in the hospitality industry where you almost have no intellectual property.

337
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,750
Everything's about how the culture of the organization works.

338
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,549
And that is that permeates through your team and how they make people feel great.

339
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:40,450
So ultimately Bluestone only has one, one core tenant, and that is to have an amazing

340
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,369
human connection, focus culture.

341
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,009
And I think that's the key to the success of the company, because anyone can make great

342
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:45,410
coffee.

343
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,369
Anyone can make a great avocado smash, and anyone can do the majority of, of things that

344
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,490
you find out there, but it's all through that execution base.

345
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,829
And I think that when I read that I was like, stop worrying about people's ideas.

346
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,349
Stop worrying about competition.

347
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:04,150
Just focus on controlling, just focus on what you can control and executing.

348
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,809
And there's lots of opportunities for everyone.

349
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,130
And that, and, and certainly the koala mafia plays into that.

350
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,329
That.

351
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:17,769
These Australian entrepreneurs helping each other, supporting each other, advocating for

352
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:18,430
each other.

353
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:23,710
Um, it's been extraordinary and we are so lucky at Bluestone that that happened.

354
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,849
And it really underpinned, uh, you know, the first store in our, our success.

355
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:32,690
We opened it in midtown Manhattan around the corner from where I was working at two 70

356
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,990
park Avenue and JP Morgan building.

357
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,369
We're at 47th and park.

358
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:42,130
And we opened at a 40, between 49th and 50th on third Avenue, a class B, maybe class

359
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,890
C office tower with no anchor lead anchor tenant.

360
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,309
And it was down this mezzanine, um, subterranean sort of basement.

361
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,609
And, uh, you had no straight visibility.

362
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:55,569
You had no signage.

363
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:58,569
You went out, but I put a sandwich board at the front or decals.

364
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,970
You really could only find it through word of mouth.

365
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:05,210
And the people that got that going from the first day, I think we sold 400

366
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:12,069
coffees because all the Westpac guys, the ANZ, the Macquarie guys, the nab guys, all

367
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:12,089
people.

368
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,990
They're friends and they're American colleagues come down and try proper coffee,

369
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,789
come down and go to a Australian cafe.

370
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,529
And that's how it developed back then.

371
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,009
We were very Instagram.

372
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:30,130
It's sort of just started around 2013, but we weren't using Facebook and we didn't

373
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,210
have the budget for it.

374
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,650
And, and really ultimately like the best places you go to for someone telling you,

375
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,509
recommending to you, and that's how it works.

376
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,009
And, and I do think those Australians getting behind.

377
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,009
So you can just go to one of the best places in Australia and say, Hey,

378
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,730
I'm going to buy you an American coffee.

379
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,009
We're going to sell you a big cup of American coffee, which is a little bit

380
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,250
cheaper than the one you buy in Australia.

381
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,970
And you can just go to a local market, you can go to a local retailer,

382
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,289
you can buy a coffee and they'll sell you a big cup of American coffee.

383
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,369
So you can just spread the word.

384
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:57,890
You can just go to an Australian coffee shop and say, Hey,

385
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,670
this is fantastic.

386
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,890
We need more of this rather than, Oh, wow, that third store is not as good as

387
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,769
the first and they've lost their way and they're sold out in commercial.

388
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,849
Uh, you know, I don't, I just think it's a very, um, myopic way to look at things.

389
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,529
And I'd much rather be part of growing a bigger pie and supporting everyone.

390
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,130
It's a great quote, Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn.

391
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,650
I love it.

392
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,190
I love that.

393
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:18,630
It's such a healthier way to live too, Nicky, when you think about it.

394
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:22,150
And Simon Sinek talks about worthy rivals.

395
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:23,089
There's no competitors.

396
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,490
And having someone in your space do it well is actually brilliant because it inspires

397
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,049
you to be better and execute better, as you just articulated.

398
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,049
I mean, you started, Nick, with that brilliant word of mouth and the support from the Australian

399
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:41,029
community who only found it because they loved it and passed it on because they loved it.

400
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:46,490
But then you got some pretty good initial sort of celebrity organic traction, didn't

401
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,569
you?

402
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,089
Taylor Swift was a customer and a lot of the Victoria's Secret models.

403
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,309
And I love Malcolm Gladwell, the legendary author, said this,

404
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,230
Bluestone Lane is a force for good.

405
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,309
We need more brands like them.

406
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,970
How important was that to get that level of connection from well-known people?

407
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,309
Well, if we go back to when we opened, the first two stores, one was this midtown Manhattan

408
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:11,009
near where I live.

409
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,109
So I was in there and frequenting and trying to aggregate everyone to go down.

410
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,930
And then the second one we opened was next to the Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange

411
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,410
and Wall Street, 30 Broad Street, which used to, the Stock Exchange used to extend into

412
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:25,990
the building.

413
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,470
So it was a pretty historically significant building.

414
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,930
And we put a coffee shop in the lobby and it was 85 years old, never had a retail amenity.

415
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,750
And that was really busy too.

416
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,809
I remember we opened on my birthday back in 2013 and that was a cool day.

417
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:49,470
And then the next year in around May, June, we opened our first cafe, the broader offering,

418
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,269
table service, much broader menu, more seating.

419
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:59,769
And it was on the corner of Greenwich Avenue, it still is on the corner of Greenwich Avenue

420
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:00,410
and Perry Street.

421
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,809
And Perry Street, for those who've been through West Village, that's where Carrie Bradshaw

422
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:10,410
out of the series Sex and the City used to walk out those big doors on the top of the

423
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:10,690
stoop.

424
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:15,049
And Mr. Big would be down in the stretch limo and pick her up and take her off gallivanting

425
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:15,829
in New York City.

426
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:21,829
So, and my wife and I, well, back then, girlfriend and I, Alexandra, had always lived in West

427
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:22,049
Village.

428
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,349
And we lived around the corner from the spot, Perry and Greenwich Avenue.

429
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:29,750
And there was a store there and it used to be a barbershop.

430
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:35,029
And they'd gone out of business, another one of those stats that you read out earlier.

431
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:39,390
And we just think, I just could feel like this could be something magical.

432
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:40,750
And we went.

433
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,369
We went out opening it and we had Australian friends.

434
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:44,710
We had Australian designer.

435
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,890
We had Australian builder.

436
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:47,930
And that's why we named it Collective Cafe.

437
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,869
And we got it open and we didn't have enough money to put proper air conditioning in.

438
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,069
That was a big mistake.

439
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,109
We didn't have a proper kitchen.

440
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,910
But you're right, just out of the gate, it just took off.

441
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,630
And then you had the who's who walking in.

442
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,970
And obviously, when Taylor Swift came a couple of times and then it's Leonardo DiCaprio, it's

443
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,650
James Franco.

444
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:17,470
It was very serendipitous that we were positioned next to the number one spray tanning salon

445
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,049
in downtown Manhattan.

446
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,509
So you had all the Victoria's Secret girls coming in and all these actors and actresses.

447
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,329
It basically created a category.

448
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:36,190
That was, I think, the emergence of the Australian daytime premium cafe genre, which now extends

449
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,089
into all of the tier one cities in the world.

450
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:39,890
You're going to find.

451
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,589
And these types of cafes and it was the first time it was a really light beachy color, more

452
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:52,470
feminine with turquoise, seafoam, green tiles and white walls, walls and blonde timber and

453
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,210
just a place which had an atmosphere of being more inviting and more relaxing than the broody,

454
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:04,730
dark, reclaimed timber and blacks that you'd often find in Brooklyn and and a bit maybe

455
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,650
more hipster. And we were just a bit more fresh.

456
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,329
And it just accelerated.

457
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,990
And I used to see Malcolm went there every day, I think, for two years.

458
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,869
I'm sure he wrote a book there.

459
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,490
That thought was that he'd sit outside on the patio.

460
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,849
But that was a pretty significant one.

461
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:24,630
But I remember one day I walked in as a couple of stories.

462
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,789
The first one is Sarah Jessica Parker.

463
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:31,230
Well, I walked in one day and Sarah Jessica Parker sitting at the front, having a coffee, chatting with a friend.

464
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,829
I'm like, this is this is the queen of West Village.

465
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,210
And we carry Bradshaw and Sexton City.

466
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,210
And I remember walking.

467
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:52,109
I'm watching that show and thinking about, wow, imagine living in New York and just the adventure, the excitement, the spontaneity of working and living and experiencing all of New York.

468
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:54,029
And then the next thing, she's sitting in your cafe.

469
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:55,950
And then there was another story.

470
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,190
I remember I got a phone call because you mentioned the Dimitinas.

471
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,549
Well, Andrew Dimitina worked with us for a while back there.

472
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:05,089
And Dima and I were at Collingwood together for a couple of years.

473
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,990
And Dima's great friend, Tony Pantano, who's one of the great people in New York City.

474
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,470
And he's one of the principals at Only Hospitality with Julian.

475
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,250
They've got venues all over Melbourne.

476
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,769
They do a sensational job.

477
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,569
And Tony, I came down.

478
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,069
It was snowing. It was in winter.

479
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,329
And Tony was there.

480
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:23,890
And I walked in and I said, you know, how's it going?

481
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,009
And he goes, oh, got a bit of a problem with the waitlist.

482
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:31,009
And I looked at the front and I saw Cameron Diaz sitting outside in the snow having a coffee.

483
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,710
I said, Tony, what are you doing?

484
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,869
It's Cameron Diaz.

485
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,789
And he said, well, what do you want me to do?

486
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,009
That's the only table I had.

487
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,210
And I said, you know, she was in the cafe.

488
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,250
She offered a turn.

489
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,589
She said, sit outside.

490
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:42,269
And she was fine.

491
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:52,650
And, you know, I think that also emphasized the, you know, underpin the attitude that we had, that we treat everyone the same, even if they are super mega celebrities, that just treat them like they're a local.

492
00:32:52,829 --> 00:33:01,009
And that actually drove them to come into the store because they just wanted to go with their friends or their family and relax and don't make a big deal out of it.

493
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,710
Don't encourage people to take photos.

494
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,430
Don't have the staff, you know, go over the top.

495
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,089
And that, I think, really built around the authenticity.

496
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,890
And what we're doing and it just continued from there and, you know, we've been very lucky to have a lot of famous academics.

497
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:24,150
I remember just after Richard Branson is sort of one of my heroes growing up that did his first time.

498
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:33,509
He traveled with Virgin orbit up in the space and then he came back and two days later I saw him in one of our cafes in Midtown.

499
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:34,710
That was pretty cool, too.

500
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,690
So, yeah, very fortunate.

501
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,789
But we serve seventy five thousand people a week.

502
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,970
And.

503
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,329
So there's a good chance you're going to get someone who's pretty interesting in that.

504
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,990
What a great level of storytelling.

505
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,269
It's fascinating, isn't it?

506
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:54,190
From long way from Victoria Park, mate, to downtown in the coolest hipster part of New York City.

507
00:33:54,509 --> 00:34:00,130
It's a serious business now, as you said, seventy five thousand people a day drink Bluestone Lane coffee.

508
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,890
You're the CEO, you're the M.D.

509
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,609
What have you found out about yourself as a leader of a business at this scale?

510
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:06,509
What type of leader are you?

511
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,170
Well, we've actually been.

512
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:28,349
We've been undertaking some leadership training with a with a group at the moment, Paul, Paul Ruse's group, Performance by Design, which has actually been, yeah, it's been really fascinating to to just to reawaken it, because I'm very fortunate that my mother in law is quite, quite an expert in positive psychology.

513
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:37,349
And she was at the forefront of talking to me about my personality type and my briefs and my communication style and what I should do under stress.

514
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,150
And, you know, I.

515
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,909
I think for me, I'm a very, very determined person and I love I love trying to improve.

516
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:50,429
I'm a relentlessly focused on learning and getting better and I feel I love being part of teams.

517
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,650
I do not like trying to do it by myself.

518
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,710
I love aggregating and coalescing a group of like minded individuals who want to give it at all.

519
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,429
And ultimately, I really look for that that value of dependability.

520
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,690
I think that having outstanding talent just doesn't really.

521
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,690
It's not what I really navigate towards.

522
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:15,650
I want someone who's so committed and so dependable that I know the effort I'm going to get all the time.

523
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:27,590
And and for myself as a leader, you know, I've had to continue to evolve because I came from an elite environment in the AFL system for six years where it's pretty.

524
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:34,429
You think about it, you have a lot of type A people that have been working towards this.

525
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,550
They've been conditioned or they get in the system and they've taught.

526
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:48,730
They've been conditioned at a very impressionable age and you learn a lot about discipline and routine and self-belief or lack thereof.

527
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,969
And then I transition into banking and banking.

528
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:59,710
It's reasonably homogenous that the people that work there have similar sort of university degrees and probably similar academic profile.

529
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:06,190
And they're very, very focused and they're prepared to pay, you know, make enormous sacrifices.

530
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:07,590
And then when I went to blue.

531
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:15,130
Stone, you know, Bluestone Hospitality, the majority of Bluestone Lane team don't foresee themselves working there in two to three years.

532
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,530
It's very much a gap or hobby job.

533
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:34,030
So to change your leadership style from being part of really smaller, high performance environments where you're talking about in some cases like the best of the best, reasonably homogenous to now Bluestone where you have 120 percent turnover.

534
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,449
You have a lot of people from very, very diverse backgrounds.

535
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,469
A lot that come from very unfortunate circumstances.

536
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:55,369
And we've got a chance to have a huge impression and give them a lot of self-confidence about themselves, the difference they're making to others, the opportunity for development and that meritocracy of Bluestone.

537
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,150
That is ultimately if you make people feel good and you play your role, you can go all the way up.

538
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:06,050
And I pride myself on focusing on developing those from within rather than looking externally.

539
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,670
That is something that matters.

540
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,650
So much to me.

541
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:20,050
And hopefully that's something that I'm really known about, that I take enormous amount of, I care a lot about our team and I care about, you know, giving them the best shot at life.

542
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:36,449
And working in the U.S. has awoken a lot of those discrepancies in childhood, in education, in how to eat well, how to, you know, a lot come from broken homes where parents are incarcerated.

543
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:37,449
Or, you know.

544
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,889
You know, they've never finished high school.

545
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,650
And that's been an enormous eye-opener and something that I'm so grateful, the experience of having.

546
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:51,110
Because working in banking and footy, it was fantastic.

547
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,849
But, yeah, you're sort of only dealing with a small tranche of society.

548
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,510
And this has been a lot more broader.

549
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,110
And I'm very grateful for that.

550
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,269
And I think it's made me a lot better leader than otherwise.

551
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,630
Aspiring entrepreneur listening to this, Nick.

552
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,510
You left the safe world of banking, as you said.

553
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,489
You're on the path to have a really successful life and financially rewarding and a lot less risk.

554
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:18,170
I mean, you've had to deal with 87% of your turnover disappearing in two weeks.

555
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,730
It's not, you know, an easy path, the entrepreneurial path.

556
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:24,469
What advice would you give to someone who's thinking about it?

557
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,190
I think the best thing to do is to spend an extensive amount of time becoming an expert.

558
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:37,449
And over time, what I found is, like, thinking about all of the things that potentially could,

559
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,550
you know, go wrong and mapping out a little bit of a mitigant.

560
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,630
Because what I found is through, it's just like training.

561
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,010
You equip yourself for the unexpected.

562
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,909
And I found that typically when I speak to entrepreneurs, I'm like, okay, think.

563
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,010
You've got to spend a lot of time up front.

564
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,269
Because there's no point having a false launch when you can avoid it.

565
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:00,150
And no one wants a business to fail when you can avoid it.

566
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,010
Paul Rose had an excellent quote.

567
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,170
He said that, you know, you never want to make a decision under pressure if you can avoid it.

568
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,349
And I see that with.

569
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,110
Building a business.

570
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:09,690
Really, really map out.

571
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,650
Really map out about what your true value proposition is.

572
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,269
How are you going to be successful?

573
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:16,590
Who your customer is?

574
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,869
What's your cost base like?

575
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,170
What's your cost base and cost structure like?

576
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,989
How are you going to manage this?

577
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,429
Or where do you think your role will evolve to?

578
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:32,769
Because when I started Bluestone, I had the view that I definitely wasn't the best person to be full-time CEO of Bluestone.

579
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,349
There's just no way that Bluestone could really probably handle my ambition.

580
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:46,269
And my probably formality in my experience in business, it needed to be a bit more laissez-faire.

581
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:51,610
It needed to be a bit more casual and grow and see where it went because hospitality isn't linear.

582
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:56,369
You have peaks and troughs and most businesses aren't.

583
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:04,409
And, you know, I think becoming a student and addressing all those questions and over time, you're like, yeah, you know, if this happened, this is what I'd do.

584
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,889
And I just found through that exercise.

585
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:15,309
That you gain an enormous amount of confidence because you've thought about a lot of things that could go well or might not go as well or to plan.

586
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,110
And that gave me enormous confidence.

587
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:19,070
So, you know, they're my tips.

588
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,690
And, you know, I don't think you want to rush anything, honestly.

589
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:31,010
I think you just want to say, if you think you're ready, just take another week and talk to someone about it and reach out to a mentor and take them through it.

590
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,710
And just bounce around a few ideas because you might as well get it right and give yourself the best chance of being successful.

591
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:44,570
Rather than launching too early and just not getting a bit more of that, you know, that value, that insightful feedback.

592
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,389
And then, of course, you know, you've got to pick who you're going to take feedback from.

593
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:54,710
You know, everyone's got, you know, it's easy to provide, but it's hard to take.

594
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,090
And, you know, you've got to work out who really understands what you're trying to do.

595
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,630
And, you know, that's something that I've had to learn through as well.

596
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:06,769
Lots of people told me, don't do it or you wouldn't have an idea.

597
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:10,010
And doing it or don't scale it or sell it now.

598
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:18,349
And ultimately, you know, I've had others that have just been experienced enough to say, you know, I think that you should be aware of this.

599
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:24,329
But ultimately, you've got to back your gut and you've got to back your judgment because that's why we're sitting here right now.

600
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:26,829
And I love the story.

601
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:32,750
If you think Nick didn't put some preparation in, I'm told you spent hours and hours and hours in Starbucks just studying customers.

602
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:36,130
I can picture you there just writing notes down.

603
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,090
And seeing your gap in the market.

604
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:42,230
Nick, I love talking to different leaders in different backgrounds.

605
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,409
And, you know, your story's fascinating to me or someone who's in the arts, in a creative world.

606
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:53,489
But we see success leaves clues and different patterns of leadership.

607
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:59,090
I want to ask you these series of questions that we see are quite common for people doing great things like you.

608
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,130
Starting with self-leadership, Nick, we feel like very hard to be able to lead others without a sense of your own self-leadership.

609
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,110
What does that mean to you?

610
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:13,010
I think you just need to know who you are and what motivates you and what you're passionate about, what your values are.

611
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,710
And I think when you're comfortable with yourself, you're going to be comfortable with others.

612
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:24,130
And you'll also be a much more impactful leader because you'll be your authentic self.

613
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,750
And I think you can present with that vulnerability that you don't have all the answers.

614
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:30,929
That you're using these signals to form a view.

615
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,429
And that you're open to feedback on certain things and maybe others that you've got a really strong view.

616
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:35,670
Yeah.

617
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,070
I appreciate your comments.

618
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,230
They're like, I'm going this way.

619
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:41,909
And that's that self-confidence and surety that you need.

620
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:48,329
And I think doing that investment, and for me, I didn't do that investment enough when I was playing AFL.

621
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,429
I just, I hid my emotions.

622
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,869
I hid the way I was feeling.

623
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:57,989
And when my AFL career finished, it was liberating that it was over.

624
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,389
I was deeply sad that I probably didn't achieve my childhood dreams.

625
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:05,550
But it was liberating that I could probably be myself a bit more.

626
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,530
And attack my next career with more reckless abandon.

627
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,010
With just confidence and to go for it.

628
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,710
And, you know, I think that that's, I found that it's hard when you do a lot of self-assessment.

629
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,429
And especially as a CEO.

630
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,050
Because, you know, of course people are going to say that you're the CEO.

631
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,269
You're probably really, really passionate.

632
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,269
You're carrying a lot of the weight of the organization.

633
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:32,250
You care about your team and their performance.

634
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,250
Because ultimately that will impact the company that you're the custodian.

635
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:43,469
But, you know, it takes a lot to make yourself that vulnerable to take it on and to change.

636
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,530
And everyone, I found that I can change and sometimes will slip back.

637
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,909
And you need that reminder.

638
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:55,590
And I'm very fortunate that both my family support network, both at home here,

639
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,750
but also in the business with my brother working there,

640
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:59,949
can always give me the tap on the shoulder and say,

641
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,889
listen, I think you could handle that a little bit differently.

642
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,349
I appreciate that.

643
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,530
What you're trying.

644
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,329
But the way that you articulate it might not be as impactful for someone else.

645
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,230
And that's something that I think we're probably, everyone's on a journey.

646
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,130
And it's always evolving because communication styles have changed so dramatically

647
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,610
with technology and social media and the way that people process information

648
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,170
and how they receive information.

649
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:32,789
And I always think with someone who is self-reflective and a constant learner like you,

650
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,510
you go into that category where you don't even have

651
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,510
to worry about because you are going to be open enough to admit when you get it wrong.

652
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,050
And that hasn't always been the case.

653
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,130
And no one is perfect.

654
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,429
There's so much joy for people to know that they're in an environment

655
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:51,150
where the person leading them themselves are trying to get better each day.

656
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,170
We see leaders are really conscious about how they positively impact people

657
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,230
in their environment every day in a really sophisticated way that they think about that.

658
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,550
How have you gone about that impact?

659
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:05,389
Well, I think for us,

660
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,110
you always want to, we are in the business of moving the masses.

661
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,670
So I'm not in a small team.

662
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,809
We have a thousand employees and we have a very high turnover.

663
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:19,469
We're serving thousands of people, tens of thousands of people a week.

664
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:26,929
So for us, we have to have a whole huge cohort of people moving in the right direction.

665
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:29,369
They have to be very, very disciplined and very selfless.

666
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:35,530
If a local comes in and they're having a bad day and they're rude to one of our team members or teammates,

667
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,949
they still have to be positive.

668
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:41,550
They still have to execute along with our value proposition and our steps of service.

669
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,570
And that takes an enormous amount of discipline.

670
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,489
So for me, I just really always need to emphasise where they're coming from.

671
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,369
And I need to make their jobs easier.

672
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,349
And I need to be sympathetic to concerns that they have.

673
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:59,550
And we've been very, very much on the front foot of a lot of diversity initiatives.

674
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:05,530
Certainly, as it relates to what happened, COVID and the killing of George Floyd,

675
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:15,929
and supporting healthcare heroes, and just being a real advocate for a lot of these campaigns and initiatives and social needs.

676
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:21,530
We just get on the front foot and we do things that are very much on a grassroots level.

677
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:25,570
You don't have to raise a tonne of money.

678
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:30,510
You don't have to shut your whole business down to campaign for something.

679
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,510
It's often small, meaningful contributions.

680
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:35,510
Which often...

681
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,429
Often can be involved or led by the team that make a big difference.

682
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,530
And for me, it's just being very sympathetic to the way that...

683
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,929
And empathetic to the way that they're feeling and the environment.

684
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:52,750
And seriously, the last three years, you probably couldn't imagine a more turbulent period to run a retail business.

685
00:46:53,489 --> 00:47:01,849
And for us, it's just being very honest, giving everyone a hearing and trying to lead with positive and good intent.

686
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,750
And doing...

687
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,469
Leading with actions rather than words.

688
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,929
And that's underpinned us, I think, really well.

689
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,909
You're never going to be able to solve everything.

690
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:16,510
You're never going to be able to cure everyone's ills.

691
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:26,630
But I think showing initiative and being compassionate and just giving people a chance to voice has helped us tremendously.

692
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:32,269
And that's a critical part of leadership, I think, in times we're facing right now.

693
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:32,929
Yeah.

694
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:35,369
What a great credit to you to give away hundreds of thousands of dollars.

695
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:41,889
Thousands of free cups of coffee to first responders in that challenging time amongst all the other initiatives that you do.

696
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:46,889
Creating and sharing a vision is something that we see really common in leaders.

697
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,530
They understand their vision and they've got a really clear way about how they share it.

698
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,610
Bluestone Lane is a big vision.

699
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,489
How have you gone about creating and sharing that?

700
00:47:55,809 --> 00:48:03,730
Well, for us, you need to be crystal clear and you need to have a lot of repetition and you need to live and breathe it.

701
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,730
So, yeah.

702
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:09,829
The key terms in your organization are so critical.

703
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:34,429
So, in our example of having locals, not customers, having teammates, not staff, having you're talking about the experience, not the transaction, a lot of repetition and ensuring that all of your materials and we have a really extensive digital learning management system and just having all of these introductory items that we really have got to celebrate people when they join.

704
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:35,130
And

705
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:51,489
a lot of times that people celebrate leavers, but you've got to spend even more time celebrating when they join to make sure that first impression and you give them a chance to be successful so that they feel like, wow, I'm joining something that's incredible and look at this induction and I'm going to be a star here.

706
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,010
I think that's really, really important.

707
00:48:53,590 --> 00:49:02,469
But, you know, one thing that we did about sharing the vision is trying to articulate what it feels like and how they will see it.

708
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,269
And, you know, it's great for us to.

709
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:14,750
Say that we want to be the best Australian hospitality export or something big like that, a big, but what's tangibly how they're going to see it, how they're going to feel.

710
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:32,949
And I think breaking that down and being really, really selective in the core values, the core tenants of the organization, we only have four core values, and then being really clear on what the key success factors are and how they would play out has helped our business enormously.

711
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:34,690
And we, we are.

712
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:51,250
I used to have this, I've had this challenge over the years, like what is a great Australian inspired premium coffee cafe experience and, and, you know, I could articulate like it's just the way you make people feel it's great coffee, it's great food, it's great music, it's great.

713
00:49:51,710 --> 00:50:04,469
But ultimately, like we had to sort of dig a little bit deeper and say, well, you know, in a coffee shop, it's probably speed, really important for coffee, recognition, quality product.

714
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,530
It's probably, you know, cleaning, cleanliness.

715
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,710
Whereas cafe's is probably spend through service.

716
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,869
So how you serve someone and educate them at the menu, human connection.

717
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:24,409
So beyond just recognizing someone, but really human connection, making them feel amazing because 90% of our dining transactions are two or more people.

718
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,329
Premium broad product, a lot broader, and then beautiful spaces.

719
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:29,769
Cleanliness, is not enough in a great cafe.

720
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:33,710
Yes, clean, it's got to be beautiful space and that's those atmospheric elements that hospitality.

721
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:41,570
You know, communication is everything, and I don't think anyone's got a perfect science on how to communicate or which method.

722
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:54,030
And in our organization, we have email, we have Slack, we have, you know, Telegram, we have text message, you know, and everyone, it's a constant tug of war between too much and too little.

723
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:02,070
But, you know, I think you need to, when you sell the vision, you've got to distill it down to what does it mean to a new joiner?

724
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:20,429
And repetition really has helped us, and just being really clear in our language and those key tangible elements that they'll see where they'll go, yeah, now I understand the role and the part I play in achieving that larger vision.

725
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:31,929
And I've experienced that at Bluestone Lane, where I've had the great, you know, fortune of a couple of weeks stint, and then you pick up your local one, you might be staying in Midtown, and you walk past, and by day three, one of your team has gone.

726
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:40,710
They've clocked who you are, they know your order, you're the guy that wants the gluten-free doughnuts, that's me, yep, along with the coffee.

727
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,510
And so you can see that your systems are clearly working at scale.

728
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:54,090
Curiosity is a term that we hear a lot from people in leadership roles like yours, and through curiosity, they're constantly looking at how they improve.

729
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:54,989
Does that resonate with you?

730
00:51:56,289 --> 00:51:56,849
Absolutely.

731
00:51:57,269 --> 00:52:01,710
There would be no Bluestone if I wasn't curious about how hospitality works.

732
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:01,849
Absolutely.

733
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:07,550
And honestly, I have a very shallow view of Starbucks being an Australian.

734
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,989
You know, I think most people talk quite negatively about it and put it down.

735
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:21,349
And then I remember a day at business school, I looked up and I just searched Starbucks market capitalization, and it was nearly 90 billion US.

736
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:26,429
And at that stage, back in 2010, I don't know how many Australian companies that were that big.

737
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:29,349
I think it was bigger than every bank other than CBA.

738
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:30,829
And this is Starbucks.

739
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:31,550
This is Starbucks.

740
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,849
Like something that I thought that they can't make coffee, they can't provide a great experience.

741
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:41,650
So I think from that, you know, that is just the way my mind has naturally worked.

742
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:50,889
I love listening to stories and learning from others and just being curious on how you can change and consider things in a different light.

743
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:57,769
And Bluestone, I have been unencumbered with the formality of hospitality training.

744
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,369
I was not a trained chef.

745
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:00,590
I was not a trained barista.

746
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,530
I was a customer.

747
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:08,590
So everything was through those lenses of customer centricity and cost structure and building a lifestyle brand.

748
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:29,210
Because I was always being obsessed with brand building and storytelling and LVMH, Bernard and all, and these guys and women that just do the most extraordinary job to evoke emotion around the way someone feels when they see a product or go to a certain type of experience.

749
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,769
And for me.

750
00:53:31,550 --> 00:54:00,690
That curiosity sort of underpinned Bluestone, but challenged the way we were going to do it, doing it with a different cost structure, making food that typically Americans have never made in a coffee shop, not having all processed things and coming from a commissary, making them fresh, freshly made and, and just thinking about things differently all the time and trying to actually in the case of Bluestone, be, I guess, a chain, but have an independent spirit.

751
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,690
Where we refer to ourselves as boutique at scale.

752
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:20,250
And I just think that, that, that constantly, constantly trialing and re-imagining and prototyping has been an amazing element in the Bluestone Lane story.

753
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:30,670
And a lot of people have got, been given enormous freedom to try new ideas and think differently about what we, how we could do it and the way we could do it.

754
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,969
And that, that's probably the part that, that's the spark that keeps you going.

755
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:42,389
And it's that innovation and seeing people rise to the floor and pose different things to me.

756
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:44,070
I love that.

757
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,130
I love bouncing around ideas and that's the type of person I am.

758
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,469
I socialize and I consider and I think and research.

759
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:57,789
And yeah, you know, I think that's a, that's an essential element because as soon as you're not growing, you're, you know, you're dying basically in this game.

760
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:01,250
And, and, and, you know, I love that.

761
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:02,769
I love that iteration process.

762
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:06,809
The next dimension of leisure I want to talk to you about was communicating with clarity.

763
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:11,769
And you started there and you said, we've got Slack, we've got Messenger, we've got WhatsApp, we've got text messaging.

764
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:18,469
And, and obviously you, you've had a serious think about communicating with a thousand staff and an expanded team.

765
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,829
You're right across both coasts of the U.S.

766
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:22,570
How have you gone about it?

767
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,090
Well, snail mail's tough.

768
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,309
And, uh.

769
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,789
And, you know, it's, it's a hard one.

770
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:40,030
It's a really hard one because there's also a lot of considerations because I might have 10% of my team that are accessible all the time, but 90% aren't.

771
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,090
You know, they're only really working for you when they're on the clock.

772
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:51,630
And, uh, so how do you, how do you, how do you communicate or how do you get their interest when they may not see themselves with Bluestone long-term?

773
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:56,789
Um, it's a tough one, but ultimately you've got to try different things.

774
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:58,989
You need to measure them and you need to challenge them.

775
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:03,989
And for us, that's, we, this is our second, uh, stint at Slack.

776
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:09,429
We had Slack for a couple of years, then we put it down and then we've re, re-imagined it.

777
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:18,989
And in different elements of the business share by different platforms, um, whether it's Asana or Dropbox and others use group, it's, it's always, it's always hard.

778
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:25,550
But ultimately, I think that the one thing, a couple of things that have helped us enormously, the monthly town hall.

779
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,670
We make a.

780
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:27,809
A real celebration.

781
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,969
So previously town halls were honestly pretty dry and I led them.

782
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,989
And I don't think that that was the best thing for the organization.

783
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:43,849
My communication, probably my vocabulary was, was just probably out of touch with the majority of the team.

784
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:48,090
And ultimately you want the, all your emerging leaders to run those sessions.

785
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:55,909
And now all hands where I used to talk the most, I talk the least, and I go there to learn myself, to learn about.

786
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:56,670
Those who are.

787
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:13,130
Doing an amazing job about these little random acts of kindness or, or, uh, moments where, um, uh, you know, we have a good on your mate award and where people get nominated by their, their peers, their fellow teammates, and we celebrate.

788
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:26,130
And of course it ties in with the financial performance and the key strategic focus of this month or key marketing initiatives, but it's just changed from being very content, heavy repetition to really celebrate.

789
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,849
The team and finding the good and celebrating the successes, no matter how challenging the environment is.

790
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:31,230
And.

791
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,809
In Coverage.

792
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,889
That's what we have to.

793
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:36,369
Do.

794
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:40,030
And my mom said, you know, early on.

795
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,070
I remember calling her saying, I think blue stone's gonna file.

796
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,070
And I, and we were alone in Santa Monica.

797
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,809
We couldn't get home to Australia.

798
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:54,530
Um, you know, the, the world was falling apart and she said, you know, there's always going to be a silver lining.

799
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,369
You just got to look for it.

800
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,050
You gotta be open.

801
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:56,110
It's just not for.

802
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:01,429
enough to look for it and find it and it's so true that even during really hard times there's always

803
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:08,670
something to celebrate uh and you just got to hold on to those and focus on what you can control so

804
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:16,050
with communications really being positive and certainly focusing on and as a ceo i've i don't

805
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,289
profess to be an expert at this at all but when you're a senior leader i've never i've always

806
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:27,210
underestimated the power of your own body language and uh paul ruse actually again awakened me to

807
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:31,550
this that he said that i've finished someone's career by the way i've looked at them at training

808
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:38,789
and i could really resonate with that that if you make a mistake and you run past the coach and they

809
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:43,710
shake their head you know i might go out and play that weekend terribly and the next thing you lose

810
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:49,429
confidence and then you're delisted it's so powerful um when you're the leader and you need

811
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:50,230
to realize that

812
00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:55,530
you carry enormous responsibility that your words matter a lot and the way that you your body

813
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:02,849
language and your eye contact uh it can have a profound outsized impact on your team and

814
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:09,789
that's something i'm still sort of learning to understand and harness that power and uh you know

815
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:13,469
it's something that i'm really grateful that people actually make me aware of that you look

816
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:18,630
really negative or you look really down or you look really angry or frustrated maybe take a break

817
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,269
or maybe don't talk in this session

818
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:26,230
and just try and get upbeat because ultimately any feeling of frustration or anger will pass

819
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:32,010
and you know you don't want to burn your house down because you're having a bad moment

820
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:36,929
yeah and that's really really important in leadership to understand the impact your

821
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:42,349
actions have on others nick one of my favorite uh afl moments uh this year it might have caught

822
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:46,869
i'm sure paul ruse would align with this greatly craig mccray is coaching collingwood and doing

823
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:50,110
a remarkable job and you hear him talk about his career and i'm sure he's going to talk about his

824
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:50,250
career and i'm sure he's going to talk about his career and i'm sure he's going to talk about his

825
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:55,510
wanting this team to make mistakes now it's easy to say that but on anzac day his fullback

826
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:01,789
brayden maynard kicks out he's almost missed the ball nick it's come off his shin rolled two meters

827
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:06,409
his opponent picks it up and kicks a goal straight over his head we're in the commentary box and

828
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:11,750
you're paying straight to craig mccray who is pissing himself laughing he just just spontaneously

829
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:16,610
laughed now you and i played under coaches that might have ended your career had you done a

830
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:22,250
thing and it's like well you can't fake that can you because if in that moment you lose your mind

831
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:27,409
automatically you're saying mistakes aren't okay are you so it's it's that you know to be able to

832
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:32,989
you know what next one he kicked out beautifully and away you go it's uh it's easy uh to say harder

833
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:38,230
in practice isn't it but i love uh i love saying it well people generally don't go out there to

834
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:43,949
make mistakes right you've got to assume positive intent and i think that that that's an amazing

835
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:46,590
analogy that you that vulnerability this

836
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:51,090
show that no one's perfect and as long as the intent was right and they put in the requisite

837
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:57,929
work which all these guys in afl and women in afl have and you know it's a function of life it's not

838
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:04,230
life or death you know keep it in perspective and i i need to often remind myself hey had a tough

839
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:09,630
tough store visit or a tough store day but you know we got we got more days than not which are

840
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:15,150
fantastic so hang on to those learning well said how important has collaboration been for you

841
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:22,289
enormously i there's just there's just no way that um i would have achieved anything in my

842
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:28,050
professional life without incredible mentors incredible friends family and and being part

843
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:34,010
of teams where i could learn i was so lucky to have extraordinary mentors in banking in particular

844
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:39,429
that believed in me gave me the opportunity the fact that they let me build a business on the

845
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:46,570
side while i was running a team and an important team for anz was just and part of the

846
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:51,090
european america's leadership team and having a side hustle which everyone knew about because

847
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:56,849
they were visiting daily um you know like just to think about that selflessness and the bet they

848
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:01,590
took on me that they are that nick can do this and they and his performance won't deteriorate

849
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:09,329
i'm i'm indebted to them and and that they risked they took and you know collaboration is

850
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:15,269
is is incredible i think it's one of the best parts of what's the best part of team sport

851
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:20,909
sharing those tough moments and sharing that exhilaration those wins it's just nothing better

852
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:26,809
i've never been a person that ever dreamt of as much as i'd love to like stand at wimbledon with

853
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:32,389
you know the trophy or the aussie open or win the masters i've always been i want to be part

854
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:37,349
of teams and celebrate with others and and that's probably the thing i miss so much when i move to

855
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:44,730
the states that that those points of connection three times a week playing at my amateur footy

856
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,449
collegiates and when i

857
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:52,969
finished AFL I was 23 just about turned 24 I went straight to play at collegians um rather than play

858
01:02:52,969 --> 01:03:01,090
you know VFL or another level and I just love being with others and and I've those there's

859
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,889
lessons that you learn from team sports I've applied them in everything I've done post

860
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:09,849
and uh you know they just it's such a structural advantage we get in Australia

861
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:14,969
because so many of our sports are orientated towards team whether it's AFL whether it's

862
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:22,130
netball rugby cricket and often the skill set is less specialized more generalized everyone has to

863
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:28,090
mark and kick and handball and pass and catch so I love that about our culture and I love that we

864
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:32,829
have amateur sport that if you don't it doesn't matter if you're not professional you're welcome

865
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:37,610
to participate and still have fun and I think that's underpinned so many Australians in business

866
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:44,130
particularly in the US where from a small population a population smaller than that of

867
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:44,489
Texas

868
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:49,489
half the population of California you find Australians always at the pinnacle of different

869
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:56,349
industries challenging challenging um you know the norm and and I think that's brilliant

870
01:03:56,349 --> 01:04:02,769
yeah yeah well said isn't it uh Nick and it's that great you know love of being in that community

871
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:07,309
isn't it you've created that with Bluestone Lane you've taken you know your love of sport as a kid

872
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:11,769
and and to me that was the joy and the playing team sport isn't it those lifelong friendships

873
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:19,309
the skill set you bring when you've grown up in team sport you're automatically open to feedback

874
01:04:19,309 --> 01:04:24,190
you're great get great discipline and you you like supporting others they're great people to work

875
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:28,329
with aren't they people who are passionate about team sport and I'm you can see you've taken those

876
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:35,630
lessons uh with you who's been the greatest leader in your life I think I've been very fortunate to

877
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:42,869
have a number across different disciplines that you know I'd probably say my mother you know

878
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:44,469
probably as a as a leader I've been very fortunate to have a number of people that have been

879
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:44,730
very fortunate to have a number of people that have been very fortunate to have a number of people

880
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:51,710
just someone who values that I've really and her resilience has been pretty uh inspirational for me

881
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:58,170
but um outside of family and I've been really lucky that I had probably my first boss at ANZ

882
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:05,769
was just an extraordinary guy um Dion Smith very very humble and very very thoughtful

883
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:14,469
and he's he's a man of few words but uh he was just he is just an extraordinary person

884
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:19,909
very patient he was the one that said you know in the nick um you know no matter what um always

885
01:05:19,909 --> 01:05:25,449
have a skill set and he he really really encouraged me to learn the fundamentals of

886
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:30,989
corporate finance and banking and then he was so encouraging to branch out and stretch and try

887
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:40,730
different things and um and he was such a believer in in me and I was someone who who felt you know

888
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:44,469
that I'd failed in one career and I was you know going in another one I was going in another one I

889
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:49,289
was desperate to prove myself and he just really embraced and provided opportunities and belief and

890
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:55,909
that sort of dovetailed into a whole host of succession of leaders that I worked for um

891
01:05:55,909 --> 01:06:02,469
Richard Schroeder, John Chavelle, Tim Maddock, Truett Tate, Doug Stolberg that really encouraged

892
01:06:02,469 --> 01:06:08,809
me and and they offered to mentor me and and that that that is probably the difference between

893
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:14,429
whether I'm living here in the U.S. and whether I had a great banking career in in

894
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:14,469
the U.S. and whether I had a great banking career in in the U.S. and whether I had a great

895
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:21,650
or Bluestone is just some people that really took that vested interest in me and and uh there's one

896
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:25,570
there's one other final person that has just been sort of extraordinary his name

897
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:34,530
uh is Michael Pimley and he was he is just one of those people that men I've run into I catch up

898
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,530
with him maybe twice a year and every time I sit down with him the positivity he evokes about

899
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:44,469
and how he expresses how proud he is of me is extraordinary and you know I'm

900
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:51,110
very fortunate to have come from a really supportive family um my father was has always

901
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:57,429
been incredibly supportive of myself and my brother my brother um and you know he he joined

902
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:01,429
Bluestone because I said listen I'm going to go full-time why don't you come across and he gave

903
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:08,090
up his career to get on this journey and and he tolerates a lot of a lot of those dark moments

904
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,309
that I share with him that others you don't express only the family you really express how

905
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:14,449
you feel that um and and I think that's what I'm really proud of and I think that's what I'm really

906
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:18,389
proud of and then obviously you know my wife is just a great role model the way that she's been

907
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:25,329
able to you know with our family and the way she mothers and her her career and how determined she

908
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:31,750
is and how stoic she is has been sensational so you know I've I think that you know a lot of people

909
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:36,789
look at you know leaders that you read about and I've got plenty of those but if I think about like

910
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:41,429
who's had the most profound impact on me personally I think it's probably those who are closer near

911
01:07:44,469 --> 01:07:51,369
friends that I have and um I I'm it's probably the most it's without a doubt the most special

912
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:56,570
part of my life is my uh family and friends I love the fact you get to call them out uh Nick

913
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:00,389
and the influence on on your life to reel off the names like that to have so many people just

914
01:08:00,389 --> 01:08:05,170
straight at the uh the top of your mind that it's an incredible position and I know that you pass

915
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:10,889
that on in a profound way as well you know we see collaboration as this incredible thing we're

916
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:14,449
really passionate about and the work we're doing uh in our leadership space with the

917
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:18,270
leader and you know you've had some incredible collaborators already haven't you from the

918
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:22,430
investment team I know you've just done a national partnership with Hilton Hotels and a range of

919
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:27,109
different things but has there been one they've thought god if I on any area of your life and I'm

920
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:30,729
assuming Bluestone's going to be at the forefront of your mind but if you can collaborate with one

921
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:34,890
person on one thing is there has there been someone in mind that you could share with us

922
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:41,909
oh I think I think collaborating with a with a super luxury brand I think would be extraordinary

923
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,369
so if you if you look at it what's happened

924
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:52,390
with Tiffany & Co uh which was you know a probably the true only uh luxury American brand that stood

925
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:58,930
the test of time it was purchased by LVMH which is the largest luxury house in the world um owned

926
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:04,369
by the richest person in the world uh you know they I think could collaborate with something

927
01:09:04,369 --> 01:09:10,050
something as prestigious and that has that longevity and tenure that would be extraordinary

928
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:14,310
um from a brand perspective um but you know there's there's

929
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:14,449
some

930
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:21,050
people out there that that you know you look at and Gladwell was a huge one because I'd read all

931
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:26,489
his books and he inspired me so much and then one one moment he's in as a customer but there's

932
01:09:26,489 --> 01:09:30,270
people like that you think you know imagine if you had a chance to do something special but

933
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:38,270
from a brand perspective I think that you know um LVMH uh if if uh Mr Orneau called you

934
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:44,310
and said uh I want to put Bluestone Lane in the flagship uh Dior store in Avenue

935
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:49,470
Montagne would you be ready for it I think I'd jump on the plane and just like Gordon Ramsey I'd

936
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:54,590
be there in short order well and you never know do you Nick and that's what I love about the way

937
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,390
your story is who would have thought you'd be standing uh you know the Miami Dolphins uh

938
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:03,569
Hard Rock Stadium uh doing what you've done and it is it is a global Australian hospitality

939
01:10:03,569 --> 01:10:09,729
success story of the highest order and I loved uh following it uh from afar and seeing you take

940
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:14,189
that uh step from you know coming out of the world of professional sport and to have the

941
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,310
