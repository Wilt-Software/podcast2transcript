1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:09,050
I'm not comfortable talking about myself and, you know,

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,429
you'll recognise that I'll start to deviate to where my team goes

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,489
and talking about my program rather than necessarily myself

4
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:22,190
because I come very much from a background that is a bound team

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,589
and, you know, we play a team sport and it isn't going

6
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,010
to be one individual that actually makes that team.

7
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:32,130
So I think that's where it shows up, where the spotlight starts

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,570
to then sort of come on to the individual.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,409
I know that I'm one person amongst, you know, many who have helped us

10
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,950
over the last couple of years get the Thunderbirds back into finals

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,409
and then obviously sort of winning the past two premierships.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,829
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

13
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,469
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections

14
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,369
and creating a world of collaboration.

15
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,530
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,109
to six leaders.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,189
from diverse backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture

18
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,150
and the arts who come together to learn, to connect

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,870
and to collaborate.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,329
Dr Troy Flanagan, Vice President of Performance

21
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,829
for the Milwaukee Bucks.

22
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:17,010
I've probably had some of the most radical changes

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,829
out of that leadership group.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,890
The significance of their work and how much it's really

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,030
about helping others, it made me think,

26
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,409
what else could I be doing?

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,750
And I approached our owner and within a few weeks

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,030
we'd raised $5 million to try and solve obesity

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,109
problems.

30
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,549
in the underprivileged community in Milwaukee.

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,290
So that's one spark that that leadership course has caused

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,170
to contribute and leave the world as a better place.

33
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,430
Umrah Omer, founder of Safari Doctors.

34
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,549
It defines the word creativity for me.

35
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,209
The ability to like see connections where none seem to exist.

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,510
And I think that's the magic of Alita.

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,510
Definitely not my usual, you know, workshop panels like, you know,

38
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:07,750
humanitarian spaces, but more of an intentional dissection

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,050
of leadership.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,169

55
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,240
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,860
is a true powerhouse of Australian netball, Tanya Obst.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
Tanya's journey from a talented player to head coach

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,219
is full of resilience, strategy, and a deep passion for the game.

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,620
The Obst family are sporting royalty in South Australia.

60
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,479
Her father, Trevor, a four-time premiership player with Porto

61
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,900
and Adelaide, is an Australian football legend.

62
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,639
It is no surprise to me that Tanya's carved out

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,340
a successful sporting career of her own.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Tanya took over the Adelaide Thunderbirds

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,560
on the back of them losing 23 games in a row.

66
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,000
And under Tanya's leadership, the team have achieved

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,900
incredible success winning the last two championships.

68
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,319
Tanya, thanks for joining me this week.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,439
Ah, cheers.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,479
Thanks very much, Luke.

71
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,120
I wanted to start by asking you, it's a difficult thing,

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,979
coaching sport at the elite level.

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,840
It comes with a lot of challenges.

74
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,259
What's been the key to you?

75
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,060
To build the successful culture that you have?

76
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,080
Yeah, look, it's probably been getting the right mix of players,

77
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,000
I think, do you know?

78
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,240
Like, that's been a big key for me when I came into the role.

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,340
It was around, you know, three sort of pillars, I suppose,

80
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,699
and one of those was about creating the right environment

81
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,840
and having the right sort of people along the way.

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,219
And, you know, the culture piece is something that, you know,

83
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,419
I've grown up with and seen success at what it looks like

84
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,719
at the highest level, and there is no doubt that creating a culture

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,019
where, you know, people can be themselves certainly goes a long way

86
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,939
in helping in being successful on the bigger stage.

87
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,879
Which, Tanya, is easier said than done at times, isn't it?

88
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,459
It takes a lot of skill to do what you've done,

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,620
and you've had great growth and success as a team.

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,279
Can you tell us about some of the challenges you faced along the way

91
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,819
to bring that culture?

92
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,759
You spoke about.

93
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,959
Yeah, look, you know, Luke, if I think about when I first came

94
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,040
into the role, I was all gung-ho, had a great sort of three-year plan

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,399
and was going to build this amazing team and create this environment

96
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,660
and have the right game plan, and it sort of â€“ that sort

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,139
of started to happen, and once you started to get into the nuts

98
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,899
and bolts of the actual season, holes can start

99
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,139
to appear.

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,819
And that's where, you know, I think we also sort of had COVID sort

101
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,860
of join us as well, and it was just an ability to sit back

102
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,079
and reassess where we were at and work out, well, how, you know,

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,459
we can play this game, but what is it that's sort of holding us back?

104
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,000
And there was no doubt that the culture piece was one

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,540
that was missing, and I think, you know, we were a new team

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,019
that had people coming from all different areas of the world,

107
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,279
with all different backgrounds and cultures, so it was really

108
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,480
about us creating that sense of belonging within there

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,639
and understanding and delving deeper than that surface level

110
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,279
on what is it that everyone brings, what is it that we can share,

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,939
and how do we actually get, you know, further than just the, you know,

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,220
how are you going, yeah, okay sort of conversations within our team.

113
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,100
You mentioned a diverse range of backgrounds, people

114
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,519
from overseas and different upbringings, and sports are a melting pot

115
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,699
of bringing those people together, as you described,

116
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,519
but trying to get them working for each other to achieve a common goal,

117
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,879
and you mentioned that sense of belonging.

118
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,500
Can you give us a bit more detail?

119
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,259
How do you make that work?

120
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,759
It's the key, I think, to so much success in business or in life.

121
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,639
What was, is there one particular story that jumps out at you?

122
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,060
Yeah, look, I think, you know, I sort of go back and I talk

123
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,920
about sort of the success that I had seen and been a part

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,040
of over the years.

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,040
In my earlier years, and, you know, that was very much people being

126
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,019
brought up together and learning and developing together,

127
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,019
but the biggest challenge was, you know, bringing in some Jamaicans.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
We had some English players, and what we really had to do

129
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
was establish, well, what is it that we do want to achieve here?

130
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,800
And our aim was always to make finals, and that was always the aim,

131
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,879
but it was more around sort of the why and when, you know,

132
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,860
what was hitting the fan.

133
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,459
And on the court, how are we actually going to help each other

134
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,540
through that situation?

135
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,060
Because it can be a very, very lonely place out on that arena,

136
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,139
and, you know, we started to talk more about, you know,

137
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,300
those situations.

138
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,819
We started to share experiences that we'd all sort of had,

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,160
and, you know, there was some sessions where, you know,

140
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,199
there was tears and people being really vulnerable and opening up

141
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,540
and un-sharing.

142
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,680
And sharing some experiences that they'd had in the past

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,540
where perhaps they had opened up and it hadn't been necessarily received

144
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,959
in the way that they wanted it.

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,660
So creating that sense of belonging was really important to me

146
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,579
and really delving deep and understanding the individual

147
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,819
and what makes everyone tick was really a really key point.

148
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,819
And I do remember after one of those sort of sessions with our culture

149
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,500
and leadership person that it was almost like something just clicked

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,439
within the team.

151
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,220
There was just trust, more trust on the court.

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
And when it did start to get really tough and tight out there,

153
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,779
we knew that we were working for one another for a common purpose.

154
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:22,240
Michelle Obama says the biggest misconception about her is that she has

155
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,860
it all figured out.

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,399
I'm still figuring it out, she says.

157
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,759
I still feel like an imposter often.

158
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,639
And Seth Godin says imposter syndrome is the price of entry for a life spent

159
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,240
creating.

160
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,019
When I rang you and I said, Tanya, come and join me on the podcast,

161
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,360
she went straight to there.

162
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,840
She said, I'm feeling this overwhelming imposter syndrome.

163
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,320
It's something that, you know, I think the greatest people have that.

164
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,919
Can you tell me how that shows up for you?

165
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,559
Yeah, well, your phone call was one of it.

166
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,440
You know, I suppose for me I've always been it's about the doing

167
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,399
and the creating.

168
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,200
And I really like to be judged on my actions.

169
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,159
And I'm not comfortable talking about myself.

170
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,340
And, you know, you'll recognise that I'll start to deviate to where my team

171
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,179
goes and talking about my program rather than necessarily myself because

172
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:21,240
I come very much from a background that is a bound team and, you know,

173
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,480
we play a team sport and it isn't going to be one individual that actually

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,399
makes that team.

175
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,320
So I think that's where it shows up, where the spotlight starts to then,

176
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,259
sort of, come on to the individual.

177
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,620
But I know that I'm one person amongst, you know,

178
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,820
many who have helped us over the last couple of years get the Thunderbirds

179
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,879
back into finals and then obviously sort of winning the past two premierships.

180
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,480
Tina, I mentioned the legendary sporting history of the Obbs family,

181
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,000
your family and your dad, Trevor, or Bubbles as he was affectionately

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
known, a legend of Australian football and right across the family,

183
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,639
your own family.

184
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,940
Your uncles and cousins and everywhere are incredibly talented sportsmen

185
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,620
and women.

186
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,759
What was it like growing up in that family?

187
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,860
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,580
It's a little bit interbred, isn't it, Dan, sort of the Port Adelaide with,

189
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,700
you know, families marrying families.

190
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,340
But look at, well, I suppose you're in a similar situation to us where,

191
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,419
you know, it's what I knew, do you know?

192
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,620
Like I was a little bit younger, didn't see my father play,

193
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,620
but obviously did Barak for Port Adelaide.

194
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,559
And saw a lot of success there.

195
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,080
And so I was just very immersed in that environment.

196
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,000
My weekends were spent sort of sitting in the Foss Williams stand at Albert

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
and Oval and watching Port Adelaide generally win.

198
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,080
And then come September or, you know, what is now October,

199
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,340
I would then get to sing the song a lot of the times and had a lot of fun

200
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
on grand final night.

201
00:10:53,419 --> 00:11:00,639
And it was just surrounded by success, I suppose, and that winning culture.

202
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah.

203
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,799
But not necessarily understanding that that doesn't happen for everyone.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,799
You know, I've sort of learnt that over time.

205
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,500
But, you know, for me it was great.

206
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,299
I, you know, create a lot of friendships around there and with people

207
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,139
who were experiencing the same things.

208
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,360
And I think once you're involved in the Port Adelaide family,

209
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,659
you're there for life and there's a common sort of thread.

210
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,179
And it's, you know, I obviously wouldn't change it

211
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:31,700
for the world.

212
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,720
One of the most successful sporting clubs in the world, really,

213
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,480
Port Adelaide, an incredible place.

214
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,279
They say more ashes are spread across that famous Albert and Oval

215
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,460
than maybe any cemetery in the world.

216
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,019
It's the diehards, as your family are, are remarkable.

217
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,320
Yes, we've got about three or four family members whose ashes

218
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,659
have joined a lot of supporters there.

219
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,399
The ghosts of Albert and Oval.

220
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,159
I know those stories very well.

221
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,879
You've got a great reputation, Tanya, for developing young people

222
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,440
in particular.

223
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,220
What's the key to that in your world?

224
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:19,980
Yeah, I love working with young, raw athletes who perhaps aren't quite sure

225
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,659
what to do with some of their talent.

226
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,700
I think probably one of my strengths as a coach and obviously a netball coach

227
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,980
is the ability to spot talent.

228
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,179
Yes.

229
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:30,279
Yes.

230
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:30,299
Yes.

231
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:30,320
Yes.

232
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,340
Yes.

233
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,360
Yes.

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,379
Yes.

235
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:30,399
Yes.

236
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:30,419
Yes.

237
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:30,480
Yes.

238
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,500
Yes.

239
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,519
Yes.

240
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:30,539
Yes.

241
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:30,559
Yes.

242
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:30,580
Yes.

243
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:30,600
Yes.

244
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,620
Yes.

245
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,639
Yes.

246
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:30,659
Yes.

247
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:30,679
Yes.

248
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:30,700
Yes.

249
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,720
Yes.

250
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:31,879
Yes.

251
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,139
Yes.

252
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,179
Yes.

253
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:32,200
Yes.

254
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,220
Yes.

255
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,700
Yes.

256
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:32,899
Yes.

257
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,179
Yes.

259
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:33,299
Yes.

260
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:33,320
Yes.

261
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,379
Yes.

262
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:33,539
Yes.

263
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:33,700
Yes.

264
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:33,779
Yes.

265
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,019
Yes.

266
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,039
Yes.

267
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,240
Yes.

268
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,259
Yes.

269
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:34,440
Yes.

270
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,639
Yes.

271
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:34,679
Yes.

272
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:34,799
Yes.

273
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,620
Yes.

274
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:35,899
Yes.

275
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:35,919
Yes.

276
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:35,940
Yes.

277
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:35,960
Yes.

278
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,399
The learning of the game, I think probably also the tactical side

279
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,860
and the ability to help athletes work their way through has been one of my strengths,

280
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,700
and I just love when I see a young athlete sort of come through and have a spot on our team

281
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,899
and then just make the most of their opportunities, and it's not going to be for everyone, and

282
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:00,639
I know in my previous years and years since I've been a coach for teams, and I've been

283
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,799
my previous role at the Sports Institute that just to be able

284
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,379
to bring talented athletes in and develop habits that are for life

285
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:11,639
and it may not mean that you go on and play at the highest level

286
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,000
but you are creating life habits, not just sort of, you know,

287
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,440
for netball.

288
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,799
You're creating those habits that are going to help you through life

289
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,179
but that's probably been, yeah, like that real passion of mine

290
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,759
to be able to nurture that talent, to help them explore what

291
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,679
that looks like and you need to create, as we've talked about,

292
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,679
you need to create that environment that gives them that opportunity

293
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,159
and, you know, I think that over the last couple of years our program's

294
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,059
been able to bring through some of South Australia's best young talent

295
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,480
and we've aligned that with some of the best athletes in the world

296
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,460
and, you know, we've obviously sort of repped some rewards there.

297
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,039
We all are born different.

298
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:05,860
As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks uniquely our own,

299
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,139
charting our life's course.

300
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,850
No one sees an idea, opinion or opportunity like you

301
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:23,529
and no one sees you like VU, Victoria University, uniquely you.

302
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,350
Hi, my name's Min.

303
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,009
I do a Bachelor of Social Work.

304
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,190
I got this tattoo done for my 20th birthday present

305
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,210
because I was born as a twin but she passed away

306
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,049
because my mum had ovarian cancer during pregnancy.

307
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,309
So my name's Miriindi, which means rainbow

308
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,950
and it means the bridge between, for our ancestors to reach their afterlife,

309
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,450
which is what my sister was called, which is the Wada Puti,

310
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,850
which is the Milky Way and that's where they go as like the stars

311
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,070
and they live there.

312
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,710
V is very supportive.

313
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,129
It doesn't matter if you're an Indigenous student,

314
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,429
wouldn't they bother to make sure that,

315
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,350
that you're very well taken care of.

316
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,429
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect,

317
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,590
is something we're really passionate and proud of.

318
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,789
We bring together groups of five to six people around the globe

319
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,450
from diverse backgrounds, sport, industry, social venture and the arts

320
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,269
who come together to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

321
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,929
Vanessa Ford, Chief Operating Officer at Kukua.

322
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:24,730
The Alita Connect experience for me has been transformational.

323
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,190
I met people that I would never have met.

324
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,389
Totally different spheres and it's very basic.

325
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,090
It's all about relationships.

326
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,350
It's all about how we communicate and what the Alita Connect group does

327
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,470
that is so powerful is when you bring two people

328
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,149
from two totally different worlds together, there's no ego.

329
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,929
It just leaves room for the real you.

330
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,490
And I think that's what Alita gave me was bringing back the real me

331
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,769
and really connecting to my own leadership style.

332
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:02,879
Daniel, we're very proud to have you part of the Alita Connect community

333
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,059
where we curate groups of five to six people around the globe

334
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,500
who come together from different backgrounds to learn and to share

335
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,980
and to collaborate.

336
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,240
Can you share some of the people that you've connected with in that world

337
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,379
and what that experience has meant for you?

338
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,980
Yeah, I absolutely have loved my Alita Connect cohorts.

339
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,960
I've actually been lucky.

340
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,659
I've been in two.

341
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,120
My first one was probably about three years ago.

342
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,039
And we're still catching up on probably, you know,

343
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,980
an eight to ten week basis now.

344
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,320
And Adam Vogue from WA Cricket has been in one of those.

345
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,620
And we've also had Alison Crabb and Jeanette Bates

346
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,220
from a real estate background.

347
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,039
And so when I was talking to the Alita group,

348
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,039
I had an opportunity to join not just a sporting group

349
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,980
but having some business people as well.

350
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,179
And I took that opportunity because I wanted to just,

351
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,360
sort of, spread my wings a little bit there.

352
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,380
And, you know, it's interesting that we all have same sort of challenges,

353
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,200
whether that be people management or, you know,

354
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,539
different problems that come up.

355
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,319
And it's been great to get sort of a business lens that some

356
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,680
of my first cohort have been able to share some of their experiences.

357
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,700
And there's always somehow how you can lap it over

358
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,460
into your sporting world.

359
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,119
And then the second cohort that I've...

360
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,039
I've just sort of been into our third or fourth group there now

361
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,599
is just with sport people.

362
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:40,140
And that is obviously also offering a different lens as well.

363
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,740
And I've been able to share and ask them some very pertinent questions

364
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,839
that they've obviously got very lived experiences with

365
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,980
and can share that back.

366
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,859
And, you know, you talk about the imposter syndrome.

367
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,599
You know, I'm sitting there and I'm looking at Sandy Brondello,

368
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,099
who's been to the Olympics.

369
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,539
And, you know, she's wanting to ask me how you go back to back

370
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,380
in a premiership.

371
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,299
And Emma Hayes, who is just doing, you know,

372
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,460
has done marvellous things in English women's soccer

373
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,220
and is now leading the USA soccer program over there.

374
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,099
And, you know, she is...

375
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,599
I just love her humour.

376
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,279
I love that Pommie humour.

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,740
And Jenny Bocek, who is the first female coach within the NBA

378
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,079
and just some of her...

379
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,599
some of her challenges that she's been able to share

380
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,500
and, you know, and offering us, you know,

381
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,339
the opportunity to give sort of feedback where we can.

382
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,220
It's sometimes really difficult to find that hour or hour 15,

383
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,599
whatever it is, but, you know, you just come off

384
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,839
and you still feel so refreshed and motivated and ready to go.

385
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,839
It's been a...

386
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,319
It's been a...

387
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,099
Yeah, I've loved it.

388
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,900
I've loved all of those sessions.

389
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,960
Yeah, thanks, Tan.

390
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,359
We've, as I said, been really privileged to collaborate with you

391
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,359
and I love how small the world is now that you can in real time

392
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,019
with colleagues that are doing extraordinary things

393
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,859
around the globe and your success translates, of course,

394
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,819
and all the wisdom that you've gained over your incredible life

395
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,740
in sport as well.

396
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,119
Speaking of patterns of leadership, it's something

397
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,420
that we've loved seeing the privilege to sit down

398
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,920
and do this podcast and I want to ask you about in the bracket

399
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,940
of what we call self-leadership and asking what do you do?

400
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,660
What do you do, Tanya, to be your best so that you can lead others

401
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,619
in your world effectively?

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Yeah, it's probably something that I really maybe 10 years ago

403
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:44,119
I was offered an opportunity to do some personal development

404
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:50,099
through the AIS and I think it was a really great opportunity

405
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:55,359
for me to be able to understand self more and, you know,

406
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,779
we really delved deep into...

407
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,259
to some areas that perhaps I'd never explored before

408
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:04,480
and was quite a little bit sort of confronting

409
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,200
with some of your blind spots.

410
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,920
But what came out of that was that I have a real thirst

411
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,259
for learning and a very growth mindset and wanting to understand

412
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,059
and to be better because the better that I can actually be

413
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,420
is obviously only going to be helping the programs

414
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,819
that I'm working in.

415
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm always looking...

416
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,119
looking for how I can find an edge or, you know,

417
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,000
be better on game day.

418
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,359
I tried to, you know, jumped at the opportunity to go

419
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,460
on this second Alita Connect cohort because I just knew

420
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,559
that there was going to be some pearls of wisdom drop there

421
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,900
and just trying to, you know, make sure that I take

422
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,319
those opportunities that do present and then understanding

423
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,279
and putting them back into my program is, you know,

424
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,680
wonderful.

425
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,539
One thing I did...

426
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:01,059
I have done in the past is maybe get all of this advice

427
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,400
and then it's sort of sat in a folder but, you know,

428
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,079
I've been able to really sort of lay that out amongst our program now

429
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,920
and share that and I've certainly learnt that through Alita

430
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,380
and, you know, conversations that you can have with those coaches.

431
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,299
So just always looking to be better.

432
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:26,299
I love holidays and I love holidays that generally have a sporting...

433
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,359
theme attached to it so, you know, when I'm over

434
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,519
at the Australian Open, how can I find my way in to speak

435
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,460
to, you know, a tennis coach or, you know, if I'm going

436
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,640
to the footy, how is it that I can sort of connect

437
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,680
with someone that just might be able to just see something

438
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,079
that could be the 1% or 2% difference that, you know,

439
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:46,980
makes a difference?

440
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,619
Yeah, we can see that intense curiosity to get better

441
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:52,740
in everything that you do and the great success you've had.

442
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,680
Is there one piece of leadership advice that you pass

443
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
on more than anything else to others?

444
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:05,109
I think probably, you know, with some of my...

445
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,750
the young girls that I've come through is they're very much

446
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,329
in a hurry and everything has to happen now and if it doesn't

447
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,150
happen now then, you know, is the world going to fall apart?

448
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,109
And, you know, I've been able to share...

449
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:24,589
I was never good enough to play at the highest level but, you know,

450
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:28,430
my experiences that I've gained has obviously led to me

451
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:33,130
becoming a coach at a high level and, you know,

452
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,190
I suppose I try to instil in my players that it's not going

453
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,009
to happen immediately but it's just that desire

454
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:45,289
to keep improving, keep being better and it's when it's...

455
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,569
luck is about having done the hard work and when

456
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,230
the opportunity arises.

457
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,450
So that's probably been a key when some of the younger

458
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,089
athletes that I've been working with who probably

459
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:02,630
perhaps aren't climbing the ladder as quickly

460
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,990
as they would like to but understanding that there

461
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,970
is a process and, you know, success will find you

462
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,890
if you keep putting in that hard work.

463
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:14,230
When you think of a vision for success, you've clearly

464
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,710
had a really clear vision of what you wanted to achieve

465
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,650
and you've gone and done that with back-to-back championships.

466
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:23,349
How do you go about passing that on to the team

467
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,950
and getting them to buy into the vision that you've shared?

468
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,890
Yeah.

469
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,069
I was really lucky.

470
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,450
Probably about four or five years to go to sit down

471
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,490
and listen and a chance to speak to Gilbert Onoka

472
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,750
who was the mental skills coach with the All Blacks

473
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,690
and I think was their leadership manager sort of, you know,

474
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,630
over 20-odd years and he broke down what they did

475
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,289
at the All Blacks and he just broke it down in a way

476
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:55,410
that really simplified perhaps my sort of...

477
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,109
when I relayed it to the plan that I had laid out

478
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:03,109
it was just sort of, you know, the three things

479
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,809
that really stood out for me was about empowering the athletes.

480
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:10,849
So, you know, we needed to be leaders that were worth following

481
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,670
was one of the things that he spoke about.

482
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:16,109
So what is it that we're doing and how do we empower our athletes

483
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:17,549
to also be those leaders?

484
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,609
And it needed to be something that we were work worth doing

485
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:24,490
was something else that he mentioned around what is

486
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,109
that meaningful purpose that we're doing and how are we creating

487
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:32,809
that environment that they want to come and do their job every day

488
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,890
and then the other one was about that belonging,

489
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:39,049
about the culture worth contributing to

490
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,089
and they were three really sort of key pillars

491
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,869
that I sort of added to my plan

492
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:46,769
but I really brought the team along with that

493
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:50,450
and they really, really bought into it.

494
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,849
So I had this plan and it was all sort of mixed up

495
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:56,950
but he really, just by sitting down and listening to him

496
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,950
sort of speak.

497
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,329
Everything sort of fell within those three pillars

498
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:05,730
and in the chaotic world that we work in day to day,

499
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,809
they are the things that sort of drive what we can go back to,

500
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,930
what our anchors are when things can get a little bit chaotic.

501
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,869
So, but that's not just me doing that.

502
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,829
That is obviously our staff and certainly the players

503
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:25,630
who are a part of and actually living sort of what we're working towards.

504
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,950
Tanya, we can see how intentionally curious

505
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:27,990
you are about that.

506
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,069
I think that's a great point.

507
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:28,089
I think that's a great point.

508
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,430
We are and a lot of the leaders,

509
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,410
that is a really common word that we see.

510
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:35,089
Has there been a latest rabbit hole of curiosity

511
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,970
that you've gone down that you could share with us?

512
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,150
I have some athletes who have probably challenged me

513
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,829
in a good way and maybe a couple of years ago,

514
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,470
I would think, oh, why are they asking me that question?

515
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,890
I made a deliberate decision that I would open up

516
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,250
and go, you know, where are we heading with this?

517
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,369
What does this mean for you?

518
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,289
Why are we asking these questions?

519
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,630
Because it was something that I just thought,

520
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,250
oh, you know, are we not on the same page here?

521
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,150
So that is something that I've deliberately done probably

522
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,910
over the last 12, 18 months, I think,

523
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:25,470
to really explore some of our athletes who want to know why.

524
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,470
What is happening?

525
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,430
How does that help?

526
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:27,849
And, you know, I think that's something that I've done

527
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,009
By doing that, we've been able to also create

528
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:34,769
some deeper connections and maybe even looking,

529
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,069
I've even also looked at things a little bit differently

530
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,089
that maybe I wouldn't have looked at in the past.

531
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:40,910
Brilliant.

532
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,410
Thank you for sharing that.

533
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,529
We love the quote that the cost of leadership is time

534
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:49,970
and we've all got a finite amount of it.

535
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,289
How do you find a way to balance that with home life

536
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,450
and achieving what you want in your sporting life?

537
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,730
How do you find a path?

538
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,849
How do you find a way to allocating that time for success?

539
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,930
Yeah, I probably have real, like that work-life balance.

540
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,190
Is that where you're heading?

541
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:12,049
Yeah, I really try and have specific things that I like to do,

542
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,289
especially in the season where things get really hectic.

543
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:22,789
There are times certainly after a game where I just make myself switch off

544
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,609
because I've done it in the past where you just haven't

545
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:27,829
and it's just, it's not helpful.

546
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:28,670
It's not healthy for anyone.

547
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,970
So there are certainly times when, you know,

548
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:34,609
in the week that I schedule switch-off time,

549
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,849
listening to your podcast, Das, is probably one of the things

550
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,609
that I have on my list to do.

551
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:47,829
And I always just try to get out and get away at least a day a week

552
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:54,829
if I can, just to completely sort of check out from as much

553
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,289
as you can when you're in season.

554
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,109
Yeah.

555
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:57,150
Yeah.

556
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,170
Yeah.

557
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,190
Yeah.

558
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,210
Yeah.

559
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:57,269
Yeah.

560
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,289
Yeah.

561
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:57,309
Yeah.

562
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:57,329
Yeah.

563
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:57,349
Yeah.

564
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:57,369
Yeah.

565
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:57,390
Yeah.

566
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:57,410
Yeah.

567
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:57,430
Yeah.

568
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,529
Yeah.

569
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:57,549
Yeah.

570
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:57,569
Yeah.

571
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:57,809
Yeah.

572
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:57,849
Yeah.

573
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:57,990
Yeah.

574
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,049
Yeah.

575
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:58,230
Yeah.

576
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,829
Yeah.

577
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:00,150
Yeah.

578
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:01,470
Yeah.

579
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,509
Yeah.

580
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:01,569
Yeah.

581
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:01,589
Yeah.

582
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:01,609
Yeah.

583
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:01,690
Yeah.

584
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:01,710
Yeah.

585
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:01,750
Yeah.

586
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,210
Yeah.

587
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:07,029
Otherwise, I can get it all too consuming.

588
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,509
So certainly blocking in that time and setting that,

589
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:17,049
setting that from the start of the season and remembering I come back

590
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,769
to my pillars to go, no, that is actually my time and it's okay

591
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,009
if I haven't actually done everything because if I don't do this,

592
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:25,150
then I'm not going to be any good for anyone.

593
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,710
Tanya, do you have a mantra when it comes to,

594
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:39,289
how you communicate in your world um i'd like to be um as honest as i can be i can be a little bit

595
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:46,529
harsh but fair i think is probably something that i have needed to to work on a little bit i think

596
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:52,930
sometimes and early days i've probably been too honest or delivered messages maybe that have been

597
00:28:52,930 --> 00:29:00,470
a little bit too blunt um but i've i've sort of really thought about that that empathy side of

598
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:11,970
things and speaking to um athletes as humans first um and uh also not sugarcoating things but

599
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:19,789
having an ability to go to give them the truth as best as i can um and being very clear and

600
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:22,130
asking questions back from them

601
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:28,910
um because i've certainly left some meetings not just with athletes but with staff and we've left

602
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:35,910
with very very different um yeah uh examples like very different sort of situations that we've left

603
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:42,009
with very different messaging so um very much around that uh that human first when delivering

604
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:47,970
messages but then seeking to understand um back from the from the athletes that i've been speaking

605
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,769
with tanya who's been the greatest leader in your life oh

606
00:29:51,769 --> 00:30:00,210
um oh you know there's probably a number of people i i i think you know the i mentioned

607
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,910
gilbert anoka before and my time with him was was short but it was so impactful just

608
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:13,069
just helped me put pieces together um i think margango is probably somebody who really comes

609
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:19,950
um to front of mind marg is um a legendary netball coach here in in south australia and

610
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,750
she was flying the flag and she was um she was um she was um she was um she was um she was um

611
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:38,390
a head coach of uh the of the similar competition that we we play in now she was also a mother of

612
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,369
three she ran her house and um she was also uh the south australian sports institute coach she

613
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:51,609
was she she really did so much um and just was able to compartmentalize all of that and i i

614
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:51,750
don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know

615
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:56,809
I just admired what she did and how she really was such a powerful voice

616
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:02,970
for our sport back in the day when perhaps it wasn't getting the noise

617
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,549
that it needed.

618
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,309
I've heard you mention Gilbert Anoka, who was famously connected

619
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:12,390
with the All Blacks, as you said, and your collaboration with Emma Hayes

620
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,710
and Sandy Brondello in Alida.

621
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,849
We are a bit obsessed with collaboration, Tanya,

622
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,710
and I can see you seek it out regularly to keep self-improving,

623
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,329
as you've described in this chat.

624
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,069
Has there been someone else in any passion of your life that you thought,

625
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,390
oh, I'd love to collaborate with that particular person?

626
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:34,109
One person who I have sort of collaborated in the past

627
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,130
and I don't like filling her tyres too much is Tracey Neville

628
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,589
because she's a â€“ we're competitors now, you know, in our competition.

629
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,670
But I've known Tracey for a very long time, more from on a friendship level,

630
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,690
and we had the opportunity.

631
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,849
We had the opportunity to work together in England and, you know,

632
00:31:54,069 --> 00:32:00,009
she is a fierce competitor and when I started working,

633
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,369
we started working together, it was â€“ I saw her in a very different light

634
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:10,329
as a leader and as a coach, but she also â€“ you know,

635
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:14,089
we were able to really work together and add an element of fun to it.

636
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,849
And, you know, the work that we do and the landscape that we work in

637
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,690
can be really lonely at times.

638
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,230
And you've got to be able to enjoy the people that you're working with

639
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,170
and to have that layer of fun.

640
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,289
And I know with Tracey that we certainly â€“ when we did work together,

641
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,710
we worked very, very hard, but we also had some fun along the way.

642
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,009
And that leads me â€“ I'd really love to be able to work and delve a bit deeper

643
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:45,950
with Emma Hayes because I see â€“ I just â€“ I feel very aligned

644
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,250
with her personality and the way she goes about it, but I also then look

645
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,109
at what she's done with women's soccer in England and now in the USA.

646
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,690
I'd love to be able to try and link up with her if I'm ever in the States

647
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,450
at the same time with her just to go and have a sneak at her program

648
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,230
to see how she runs and how she really works with her staff.

649
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,769
That would be pretty cool, I reckon.

650
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,470
Tanya, it's an incredible story of success and you can hear

651
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,369
how clear-thinking you are and why it's no mistake that the people

652
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,230
under you get better and everything.

653
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,529
Everything that they do and, as I said earlier, it's been a great pleasure

654
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,730
to get to know you through the Alita community.

655
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:29,890
Really appreciate you taking the time and I know you're so humble.

656
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,809
You were â€“ I had to almost talk you down to say,

657
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,549
Tanya, please come and join me.

658
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:35,150
I'm glad you did.

659
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,089
I learnt a lot from it and wish you all the best for the coming year.

660
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:39,049
Yeah, cheers.

661
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,869
Thanks very much.
