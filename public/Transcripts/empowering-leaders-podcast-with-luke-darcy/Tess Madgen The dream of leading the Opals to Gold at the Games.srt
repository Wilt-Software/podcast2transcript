00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,349
Thanks for joining us on our special Paris Olympic series of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,949
and our guest is the captain of the Australian women's basketball team, the Opals, Tess Madgen.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,449
You hear Tess sharing her story of being inspired by the great Cathy Freeman at the Sydney Olympic Games

4
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:24,269
as a 10-year-old heading out into the paddock on her country house, putting her hood over her head

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,230
and wanting to be like Cathy Freeman.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,570
She idolised Lauren Jackson, who won a silver medal in the Sydney Olympics playing for the Opals

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:38,469
and how remarkably Lauren is her team-mate in Paris at 43 years of age and into her fifth Olympic Games.

8
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:44,710
Tess sheds a few tears in this chat while talking about the impact her mum and dad have had on her life

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,829
and that she's learnt to control her fierce competitive nature so that it doesn't spill over

10
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,109
and affect her team-mates in a negative way.

11
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,409
We are very humbled and privileged to have Tess Madgen as part of Alita Connect.

12
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,109

We love bringing people together to learn, to connect and share.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,689
Tess collaborates with some legends of sport.

16
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,189
Paddy Cripps, a Brownlow medal winner.

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,810
Daley Cherry Evans from the NRL superstar of state of origin for Queensland.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,010

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,329

Head to alitacollective.com to check out the Alita Connect program.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,409
Huge thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Tempur.

22
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,250
We know.

23
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,109
Athletes like Tess Madgen value their sleep.

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,609
In fact, we've heard Tess talk about eight hours of sleep being part of her non-negotiable routine.

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,269
So investing in the world's best in bedding, Tempur is NASA approved and a mattress like no other.

26
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,609
Have a look at Tempur today.

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,480
Tess Madgen is the captain of the Australian women's basketball team, the Opals.

28
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,140
She fulfilled a lifelong dream of representing Australia at the Tokyo Olympic Games

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,540
and captain Australia to a bronze medal at the FIBA World Cup in 2020.

30
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,480
The Opals have a proud history of success at the Olympic Games,

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
winning three silver and two bronze medals.

32
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,900
Well, Tess, it's great to see you.

33
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:08,580
Thanks for joining me.

34
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,659
The whole of Australia behind you as captain of the Opals in Paris.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,139
Can you describe the pride that you must feel to captain your country at such a big event?

36
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,280
Oh, yeah, it really is indescribable.

37
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,500
I mean, I had a lot of goals growing up.

38
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,479
I wanted to play in the WNBA or WNBA, play in Europe and play for the Opals at a major tournament.

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,520
So being the captain of the team was never really on the list.

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,000
It always felt, you know, so out of reach.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,460
So to be able to do that.

42
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,099
It's very humbling and the greatest honour I could have ever imagined in my basketball career.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,900
You've ticked them all off, Tess.

44
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,759
You've done all of that, played in America, played in Europe, the second Olympic Games as captain.

45
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:49,039
How young were you when you started thinking of those sort of dreams?

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,740
It was when the 2000 Olympics were on, actually, when I saw the Opals run out in their bodysuit.

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
And, you know, they won a silver medal at that Olympics.

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,759
And our coach, Sandy Brondello, and team manager, Trish Fallon, and Lauren was on the team as well.

49
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
So it's crazy that they're all...

50
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,180
They're all a part of this now.

51
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,219
It's really...

52
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,500
It's a dream come true.

53
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,259
But, yeah, when I first started watching that, watched Cathy Freeman, obviously, it was always something I wanted to do.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,800
And me and my mum's favourite activity, fondest memory growing up, was watching the WNBL on ABC on Saturday afternoons.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,719
And as I, you know, realised I was pretty good at basketball, I started researching what all the great players did and all the ones I idolised.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,659
And they all went to the Australian Institute of Sport.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,099
They all played in the WNBL.

58
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,639
They all played in the WNBA and in Europe to eventually become Opals.

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,939
And I think from a young age, I've been very meticulous about what I do, what I want to do, what I choose to do.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,360
And I think by giving myself all those goals and all those experiences really did help me become a very well-rounded basketballer.

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,659
And to play at FIBA competition, you know, you see it with the men's USA team.

62
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
It is a different level of basketball.

63
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,259
It's a different game playing FIBA.

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,360
And you really have to be equipped to playing all the different styles all around the world to be able to be successful.

65
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:16,259
So I'm very grateful that, you know, little 10-year-old Tess was a bit of a basketball nerd and really set up all these goals and aspirations that I've been able to achieve in my career.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,060
Tess, I love someone who's got a clear vision for what they want to achieve.

67
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,319
And as you said, meticulous and can go about wanting to do that and then achieve it.

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Can you describe that?

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,060
Because I think some people feel they've got an interest in something.

70
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:28,920
They like it.

71
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,220
They train really hard.

72
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,959
But it sounds like you've got a different level of focus.

73
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,459
You don't get to where you've got to.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,220
Yeah, it's a bit of a headache sometimes.

75
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,459
I think people that are that meticulous, no matter what field you're in, they really do go on to achieve great things.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,540
I think you need that attention to detail as exhausting and draining as it can be sometimes to be that focused on something and your whole world revolves around it.

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,759
How does that show up for you?

78
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,939
What's an example of being meticulous?

79
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:58,500
I think like, for example, preparing for a game.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,379
There'll be at least 20 things I want to tick off during the week to be able to feel good mentally prepared.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,019
For that game.

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,439
And I think it more is the mental side of it that, you know, if you feel like you can do something, you can do it.

83
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,899
I love that saying, if you think you can or you think you can't, you're right.

84
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,259
And that's going to be your reality.

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:25,060
So it's probably more the mental side of me, for me, that allows me to feel prepared and enabled to perform at my best.

86
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,740
But, you know, I have to get 500 shots up every day.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,459
I have to do the correct weight routine, the exact same routine before I play a game.

88
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,639
I have to get eight hours of sleep.

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,319
I have to have a nap on game day.

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,660
I have to have a coffee two hours before the game.

91
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,300
There's all these things that can be draining.

92
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,699
But if I don't do one of them, I don't feel good enough to play.

93
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:57,180
So I think people that watch football on the weekend or watch a game of basketball don't understand how much time and effort it takes to produce those performances.

94
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,399
And whether you play well or you don't play well, you don't want to leave it up to chance.

95
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,139
And you want to make sure you're physically and mentally.

96
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,279
Ready to go.

97
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,040
500 shots a day is a commitment, isn't it?

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
And I love hearing it.

99
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,060
And I want to go back to what you said earlier.

100
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,959
In 2000, you watched the Sydney Olympics, as everyone in Australia was.

101
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,439
Lauren Jackson's running it around.

102
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,879
She's now 43 years of age, going to compete in her fifth Olympic Games.

103
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:27,399
Can you describe what it's like to play alongside someone you idolised as a girl and maybe describe what she's like?

104
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,879
Great question.

105
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,079
She's amazing.

106
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,060
She definitely makes my job as captain a lot easier.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,139
She really brings.

108
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,819
A level of competitiveness, fierceness, experience, knowledge.

109
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,360
You know, she's been the best player in the world.

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,019
She's the best basketball player Australia's ever produced.

111
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:55,160
And just to have someone like that, to be able to impart their knowledge on the other players and just really raise the standards of what is expected at practice makes my job so much easier.

112
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,839
And then she is so generous with her time and her knowledge and she really does want the best for everyone.

113
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,220
I think she's grown a lot as a person, as a leader.

114
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,939
As obviously a player that speaks for itself.

115
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,939
But she's so humble.

116
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,100
She's willing to go the extra mile.

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,459
She really does care about everyone on the team.

118
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:22,079
And being able to witness that firsthand and, you know, room with her in Brazil just recently, there is no doubt why she's so good at basketball.

119
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,639
And then off the court as well, why she's so successful in leading her She Hoops brand.

120
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,720
It's incredible, isn't it?

121
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,800
43 years of age.

122
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,439
I know you've had some challenges with the knee injury that almost looked like it was going to be the end.

123
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,899
How close did you come?

124
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,819
And can you tell us about what you've done to get to Paris?

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,860
Yeah, for sure.

126
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,899
It definitely was very close to the end.

127
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,639
I did my ACL in 2017 in Poland.

128
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:54,519
And then once you've done your ACL, unfortunately, your knee degrades at a rapido rate or more rapidly than your other knee, no matter what you do.

129
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,199
So that's what science has proven.

130
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,839
And right before the World Cup, I wasn't named captain yet.

131
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,540
My knee blew up and just out of the blue, like I was feeling great.

132
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,040
And I didn't know what to do.

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,100
And I didn't know what to do.

134
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,160
And I didn't know what to do.

135
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,180
And I didn't know what to do.

136
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,199
And I didn't know what to do.

137
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,220
And I didn't know what to do.

138
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,279
And I didn't know what to do.

139
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,000
And I didn't really want to know what was wrong with it.

140
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,939
So we managed it through the 2022 World Cup.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,540
And then afterwards, I had a scan and just a little bit of cartilage had come away, but that was causing the knee to swell up.

142
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,459
So I had a scope.

143
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,959
I was trying to rehab the scope while trying to get back for WNBL.

144
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,420
And I was just having no success.

145
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,660
My knee was so sore.

146
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,100
I'd lost a lot of muscle and just trying to still play while not being at my best.

147
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,659
I really do try and do everything to the best of my ability.

148
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,100
So not...

149
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,679
Being at that level as a leader, as a player in any way was really hard.

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,740
And I thought, this is all too hard.

151
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,419
But thank God I didn't quit or retire.

152
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,879
I went and saw a couple of different specialists who just told me to rebuild all the muscle around my leg.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,539
And I got into the Victorian Institute of Sport as a scholarship holder.

154
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,139
And the staff there are just the best.

155
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:01,700
And they've definitely got me to where I am now.

156
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,919
And that really highlighted something.

157
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,700
That I've, I guess, always known.

158
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,039
But the people you surround yourself really do matter.

159
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,460
And just being surrounded by the best of the best in terms of knowledge.

160
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,620
But also character of people and quality of person really brought out the best in me.

161
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,879
And made me think, I could still do this.

162
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,940
So huge thanks to all of them there.

163
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:26,019
And Tess, you've been surrounded by some other great athletes around the country and around the globe in some instances.

164
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,200
And we've been really privileged to have you in our Leader Connect community.

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,480
You collaborate on a monthly basis.

166
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,779
With some legends.

167
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,360
And we love sort of curating these groups.

168
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,860
Patti Cripps is a Brownlow medalist.

169
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,139
Daly Cherry-Evans is a legend of his sport in NRL.

170
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,480
Mitch Marsh is the Allen Board of Medalists.

171
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,399
He's had an amazing time.

172
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,879
And Jeeva Menthor, one of the best ever in her sport.

173
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,620
Can you tell us about what it's been like to collaborate with them in the Leader Connect space?

174
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,960
It's really been incredible.

175
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,139
I think when we all kind of went into the group, I was rehabbing my knee.

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,940
Patti wasn't having a very good time at Colton.

177
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,820
Jeeva's Collingwood netball team was folding.

178
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,860
Mitch was not in the Tess team yet.

179
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,539
He was like wondering whether he's ever going to get another chance.

180
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,419
And Daly was, um, Daly was all good.

181
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,840
He's always all good, Daly.

182
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,379
I feel like he's always all good, exactly.

183
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,080
Well, he did get dropped from the origin for a period, Daly Cherry-Evans.

184
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,159
Had to fight his way back.

185
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,879
But there's a bit going on there, isn't there, when a group gets together?

186
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,679
Yeah, there was so much.

187
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,779
And then kind of, you know, we can credit it to Alita.

188
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,100
Patti's season turnaround.

189
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,139
They made the finals.

190
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,740
Mitch was back in the Tess team, um, winning the Allen Board of Medal.

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,740
And then Jeeva.

192
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,980
Jeeva is now doing great things over in England.

193
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,340
And, um, and then Daly was representing Australia.

194
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:42,059
And it was just so cool to see everyone, like, turn it around.

195
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,080
And being able to lean on each other through those times.

196
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,480
And kind of seeing, you know, the lows and the highs that everyone goes through in sport.

197
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
And, four, they're very knowledgeable.

198
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,940
Um, we call Patti the guru.

199
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,039
And there's, like, there's no wonder why he's so good and such a good leader.

200
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,799
Like, listening to him on those talks and how well resourced he is.

201
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,279
But how he uses that to his advantage and really helps.

202
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,279
All of his teammates, but all of us.

203
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,059
Um, and then everyone has their strengths.

204
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,259
Like, Mitch is super funny and humble and really, um, lightens up the room.

205
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,220
Daly's just so cool, calm and collected.

206
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,879
And then Jeeva loves a chat.

207
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,279
So, uh, she's got so much experience.

208
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,299
So just to be able to be a part of that group and learn from some of the best leaders, um,

209
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:22,879
within the sporting industry is massive.

210
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,120
And I've really loved my time.

211
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,379
I said the other week that I went on there as quite a raw leader.

212
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,759
Like, doing my thing.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,399
Not when I, Sandy announced me as captain.

214
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,700
Who got me onto a leader, Sandy Brondello, um, the coach of the Opals.

215
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,379
She just said, be yourself.

216
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,840
You got selected for this role for a reason.

217
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,299
But I was just kind of a bit raw, you know, just, just trying to be myself.

218
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,720
But since being in a leader, I feel like much more of a well-rounded leader.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,200
And I know the processes, the procedures that I can put in place.

220
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,039
And I've just learned so much to try and not get burnt out, trying to do everything,

221
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,039
delegate and really what is important when leading a team.

222
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah, it's a great answer, Tess.

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,379
And thanks for sharing.

224
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,720
I think it's great advice and being authentic in yourself is probably first, second and third.

225
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,639
But as you then gain some knowledge and we often say leadership can be lonely, isn't it?

226
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,399
People are looking to you and having an answer when perhaps sometimes you don't.

227
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:23,840
And so we found that people find that opportunity to sit down and maybe learn something in that hour and a quarter in a session is quite valuable.

228
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,240
Have you, without, they're obviously private conversations.

229
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,799
Has there been direct things that you've been able to put in place for you and your leadership of the Opals?

230
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:31,279
Yeah.

231
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,159
Yeah, 100%.

232
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,840
I think a lot of us within that group really needed to delegate more.

233
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,639
And like you said, leadership, that was the first thing I realised.

234
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,320
My partner also runs a business and he's a really good leader.

235
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,659
So I lean on him a lot as well.

236
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:54,399
But the first thing I realised that it is the most selfless job that you could ever have in leading a sporting team.

237
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,779
And it obviously comes with huge responsibility.

238
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,039
And I think one or multiple people in the group said,

239
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,940
it wasn't their choice to be a leader, but obviously we're selfless people.

240
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,039
That's what we want to do.

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,779
That's why we make good leaders.

242
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,039
So I think just all being kind of aligned in the same reasons why we are leaders and was massive.

243
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,419
And they've definitely helped me.

244
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,360
We, you know, we do a hurdle every week.

245
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,279
And my hurdle was how to connect the group when we're all over the world.

246
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,840
So we have seven players playing in the WNBA.

247
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,299
We have players playing in Europe.

248
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,159
We have people in the WNBL.

249
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:30,899
So we get very limited.

250
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,139
Very limited time together.

251
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,000
So how do we create those meaningful connections via Zoom, via Teams meetings?

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,200
And then when we do come together, what can I get the most bang for my buck in terms of having those connections

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,519
so that we do have the trust and the level of selflessness that is needed to win a gold medal at an Olympics?

254
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,480
And they all had some really great ideas of some vulnerability exercises that they've done,

255
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,600
connection pieces that we can do through WhatsApp groups,

256
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,779
things we can do on Teams meetings.

257
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,399
So we keep that connection running throughout the year, no matter where, no matter where we are and what's going on.

258
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,220
Tess, it's a storied history for Australian women's basketball at the Olympics.

259
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,779
And an expectation comes with that, doesn't it?

260
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,440
That we think our women's team are always going to win a medal.

261
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,639
How do you manage that expectation heading into Paris?

262
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:20,840
Great question.

263
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,379
I think we won a bronze medal at the World Cup and that was on home soil.

264
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,379
And I think the expectation and pressure going into that World Cup was,

265
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,700
was massive.

266
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,860
And we knew the responsibility, like the Matildas did,

267
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,059
of inspiring the next generation of basketballers and sporting people, male or female.

268
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,620
And I think that expectation and pressure, you know,

269
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,320
was just as much as an Olympic Games could have been.

270
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,220
So I feel like we're really ready.

271
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,019
We're ready to go.

272
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,960
We had a great tournament in Brazil where we were missing two of our players from the World Cup team.

273
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,600
One player who got all stuff out of it in the World Cup,

274
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,639
Steph Talbot, who's rehabbing an ACL injury.

275
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,500
And to be able to, everyone to play so well, so connected with such limited preparation time.

276
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,659
We had four trainings on an outdoor concrete court before we played in that Brazil tournament.

277
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,559
So I feel like we're in a really good space.

278
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,820
We're really focused on ourselves, what we can do.

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,799
And I think that's a really nice place to be.

280
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,879
So I'm sure the expectation and pressure is going to build as, you know,

281
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,399
as we get into the village and we get closer to the games.

282
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,460
But at the moment, I feel like we're handling it really well.

283
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,480
And just cliche as it sounds, trying to focus only on what we can.

284
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,779
Tess, the whole country is behind you heading into Paris.

285
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,080
You mentioned 2000.

286
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,019
Have you got a favourite Olympic moment growing up with your dream to compete in Olympic Games?

287
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,059
Is there one that stands out?

288
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,840
Definitely Cathy Freeman running the 400.

289
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,600
I grew up with, I'm one of four siblings.

290
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,220
And so after the, after the race, me and my,

291
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,799
younger brother, Jack, run around our house.

292
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,200
We live, I grew up in the country, so we have quite a big property.

293
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,799
And like, we run around the house with our hoods on thinking we're Cathy Freeman.

294
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,980
Um, just that whole Olympics, there was, with the rowing, um, the eights had a really good team.

295
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,539
And we used to sit in the, um, lounge room at home and like going row, row.

296
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,799
Like just, we're really sports mad in, in my family.

297
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,440
So just that whole Olympics.

298
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,399
But if I had to pick one moment, it would definitely be Cathy Freeman.

299
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,379
This is a brilliant now that you're going to inspire the next 10 or

300
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:34,100
20 generation and, you know, Brisbane's not that far away and there'll be people

301
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,240
watching Tess Madgen at the Olympic games going, I want to be that person.

302
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,940
And, uh, what an incredible legacy to be able to pass on.

303
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,440
We love the saying success leaves clues, and we've been fortunate enough in a

304
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,919
leader to see these dimensions of what a great leader looks like.

305
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,080
And we feel it's hard to lead someone else, Tess, without an

306
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,879
understanding of self-leadership.

307
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,740
What does self-leadership mean to you?

308
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,740
Oh, that's a really good question.

309
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,320
Um, I think to me, self-leadership is about holding myself.

310
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,159
Accountable.

311
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,299
I'm never asking my teammates to do anything that I wouldn't do myself and

312
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,059
always showing up as the best version of myself.

313
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:14,380
So no matter what, I'm always trying to learn more, uh, add things to my game on

314
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,900
the court, but definitely in the leadership space, I feel like that's where

315
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,200
I've had the most growth, um, and then just trying to impart that knowledge that

316
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,859
I have gained onto my teammates so that they can be their best self as well.

317
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,160
I think as a leader, always I've, um, loved through the

318
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,940
coaching space, seeing young girls and boys light up, learning a new skill.

319
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,779
And so I've always loved that component of reaching your potential and being

320
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,500
the best version of yourself, but being able to do that with my peers really,

321
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,519
really is amazing.

322
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:47,619
So leading myself would be making sure I leave no box on tick to reach my potential.

323
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,579
Yeah, brilliant answer.

324
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,460
And I love that idea is that not asking someone to do something you wouldn't do

325
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,859
yourself and we see people like you have had great success and really conscious

326
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,980
how they positively impact other people every day in their environment.

327
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,920
You're about to go into a Paris Olympic games.

328
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,220
How do you think about positively impacting others?

329
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,579
Oh, great question.

330
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,960
I think for a memory from my Tokyo Olympics was Rowe Webster, the captain of the

331
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,660
stingers, our water polo team, just how positive she was around the village.

332
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,019
And she made everyone feel like they belong.

333
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,640
The Olympics is quite overwhelming.

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,460
You're rubbing shoulders with the best of the best athletes in the world, and you

335
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,180
can get a bit of imposter syndrome, but having someone like that around who was

336
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,920
so evanescent and vivacious and bubbly and willing to go the extra mile to make

337
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,859
every single member of that Olympic team feel included.

338
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,099
Um, I really hope to do that, um, at Paris.

339
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,359
What a great story.

340
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,059
How do you go about creating and sharing your vision?

341
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,019
You're heading into Paris.

342
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,940
I'm sure you've got a really clear understanding of what you want to achieve.

343
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,359
You've got, as you said, athletes all over the world.

344
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,920
How do you share that vision?

345
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,559
Every time we come together, we talk about winning the gold medal and I think not

346
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,400
manifesting it, but having that as a clear vision and then what we have to do to

347
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,799
achieve.

348
00:18:59,799 --> 00:18:59,900
Yeah.

349
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,299
I think we're in a really good space on the basketball court, but just keeping

350
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,819
that culture and that connection going and enabling and empowering everyone else

351
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:13,220
in the team to be able to share their vision and what they want the Paris Olympics

352
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,039
to be like and where they want the team to go, I think is really important.

353
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:21,220
So as much as, you know, Sandy and I can say our vision is to win a gold medal,

354
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,460
we need to make sure everyone's aligned with that and everyone's idea on how we

355
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,799
do that could be different and making sure we try and incorporate everyone's

356
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,339
ideas.

357
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,940
When you're leading a national team, everyone is a leader.

358
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,480
So just trying to empower that and so everyone can show up as their best, most

359
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,539
authentic self every day is probably a dream vision of any leader.

360
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,400
And I think by doing that, ultimately you will have success.

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,599
Sign me up, Tess.

362
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,259
I mean, you've got me going on that.

363
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,039
It sounds like a great culture you've got and Sandy's such a legend as well and have

364
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:59,180
great people and Lauren Jackson at 43, you can picture it, something special,

365
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,500
uh, about to happen.

366
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,619
Curiosity is a word that we use and hear a lot of.

367
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,359
And through being curious, we see people are constantly trying to learn and develop

368
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,079
this curiosity, something that resonates with you.

369
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
A hundred percent.

370
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,299
But before I started a leader, I thought like I wasn't very curious and I thought I was

371
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,839
like really set in my ways and I can be like that for sure.

372
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,200
But I think just by always trying to be the best version of myself, trying to, Patty

373
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,799
Cripps, we had to say nice thing about each other the other day and Patty said that I

374
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,160
exhaust myself.

375
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,559
Trying to always better myself.

376
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,319
And I was like, Oh, that's really, really true.

377
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,099
But I think that is being curious.

378
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,359
Just always trying to push the boundaries, push myself, you know, ask for help, ask people

379
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,220
what they think.

380
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:47,920
I didn't really realize until I started a leader that that is being curious and probably

381
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,799
I thought that was my weakest thing as a leader, but it probably is my biggest strength.

382
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,019
So just knowing all that now is, is massive.

383
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,579
And I wouldn't have had that opportunity if it wasn't for a leader.

384
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:58,700
Yeah.

385
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Why that reinforcing when you've got people who've achieved a lot that are in your corner

386
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,759
and say, Hey Tess, we see you as this great athlete and this great leader.

387
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,619
And has that been beneficial for you?

388
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,660
Yeah, it was a beautiful thing we did the other week.

389
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm a crier.

390
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,460
Like I've had some tears during this, but I'm on a leader.

391
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,039
I probably cried four times.

392
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,099
Like I find it really hard to express that I'm proud of myself.

393
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,839
So whenever I do that, I just tend to cry.

394
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,640
So when we were, yeah, the new thing in a leader is that.

395
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,140
I think after the eight weeks.

396
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,420
I think it's a week block now, everyone in the group goes around and says how they've

397
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,440
impacted each other.

398
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,680
But we, we were at our 12 month mark the other day and we did that exercise and I was crying.

399
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,220
I was like, oh, stop, please.

400
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,160
And Stace, who's our facilitator.

401
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,279
She's amazing.

402
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,480
Daly was like, Stace, we need to give you a compliment.

403
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,559
And she's like, no, no, she said like, we do this because it is lonely being up the

404
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,359
top and it's really nice to hear positive things about yourself.

405
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,119
So that was amazing.

406
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,660
I re I really loved that exercise.

407
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,240
And I'll definitely be, um, taking it into the Opals.

408
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,039
So look out guys, I'm coming for you.

409
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,819
I love it.

410
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,920
And I love that you've got that, uh, beautiful ability to express emotion the way that you

411
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,259
do.

412
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,759
And it means so much to you.

413
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,480
It's great.

414
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,700
My wife often says you went to boarding school.

415
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,079
I think that removed your tear ducts.

416
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,539
She says to me, because I'm the opposite.

417
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,519
It's not something I'm proud of, but it, uh, we, we turn up in our own ways.

418
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,000
Don't we?

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,079
Um, to, to be a leader, like you are, you, you're an incredible communicator.

420
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,339
I can, I can see that you get your words out.

421
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:28,640
Beautiful.

422
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,359
Is that something you've practiced communicating with clarity?

423
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,759
Oh, that's a, I sometimes feel like I waffle on and I don't articulate myself very well,

424
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,400
but it's definitely something I've had to work on.

425
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,839
I think as a younger athlete, I've always been a natural leader on the court.

426
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,220
Like I'm very opinionated of how things should be.

427
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,079
And, um, one of my strengths as a basketball is my IQ.

428
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm definitely not always right.

429
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:58,339
So as a younger athlete, I was a bit aggressive, not a bit like

430
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,839
asked my former teammates.

431
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,619
I was quite aggressive in how I delivered the message and still, sometimes, of course, I

432
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,960
can fall back into those bad habits, but it's something I've been consciously aware of probably

433
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,099
since I was 18.

434
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:15,880
So for 16 years, basically my whole professional career career, trying to improve my

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,220
communication, um, especially in those heat of the moments.

436
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,660
And, you know, if you'd want to be an empowering leader, the last thing you want to do is be

437
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,220
berating people on the court.

438
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,660
So that's something I've really, really had to work on.

439
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,059
I love the self-reflection to be able to understand, you know, everyone I hear says

440
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,700
you're a fiercer competitor, you're not going to meet than Tess and that's your superpower,

441
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,900
but you've had to tone that back a little bit in, in your communication is, is fascinating.

442
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,660
How important has collaboration been for you?

443
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Massive.

444
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,140
We have a leadership group of me, Seth Talbot and Sammy Whitcomb, and being able to collaborate

445
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,980
with them, we all have our different strengths, um, and leaning on them is huge, but not only

446
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,480
leaning on just the leadership group.

447
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,380
Like I touched on before, all the members of the Opal squad are leaders and just trying

448
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,880
to empower them to still be themselves.

449
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,039
I never want to be the leader that's a dictator or, um, my way's a highway.

450
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:17,059
And I think that takes a lot more energy and effort, um, to take a step back and empower

451
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,059
other people.

452
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,859
You think it would be the other way around, but constantly asking people's opinion on

453
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,200
things, how they want things to go.

454
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,519
It pays enormous dividends in the end because everyone's playing out their business.

455
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,519
And I think that's really important.

456
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,440
Yeah.

457
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,759
I think that's the best, but for a leader, sometimes that can be really hard.

458
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,200
Like it's a lot easier if, you know, Trish asked me a question and I make a decision

459
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,099
for the whole team, but I always want it to be the right decision for the team.

460
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:45,880
So that is something that I find really hard to do, but something that definitely pays

461
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,099
dividends in the end.

462
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,799
And at the end of the day, I want everyone to feel valued and empowered, and that comes

463
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,099
with collaboration, no doubt.

464
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,880
Sounds like you have great clarity on who you are and what you want to be heading into

465
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Paris.

466
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,980
It's the perfect time in your life, it seems, sitting across from you now.

467
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,000
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

468
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,839
Oh, that's a ripper.

469
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,700
I think Sandy's the best leader to be a captain for.

470
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,259
Like she's so empowering.

471
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,319
She just really, it comes with a lot of trust.

472
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,339
I've known Sandy for a lot of years, but she really does let me kind of take the team in

473
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,759
whatever direction I want.

474
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,160
And it's lucky because we're very aligned in the way we think and operate.

475
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
So as a coach, she would be the best leader.

476
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Yeah.

477
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:33,720
I've got to say my parents, like just the way that they raised me, I wouldn't be who

478
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,740
I am today if it wasn't for them.

479
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah.

480
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
So, yeah.

481
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
Yeah.

482
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
It's beautiful, isn't it?

483
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
I love this.

484
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,119
One of my favorite answers to that is that if someone's had a mom and dad have an impact

485
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,279
like they've had on you, it's a thing you want to go to straight away.

486
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,819
And I'm sure they love hearing that.

487
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,259
It's a question that I love asking and it feels like a gift, doesn't it?

488
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,259
I grew up with the same thing.

489
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,759
It's a beautiful mom and dad and I suppose we don't get the chance to say it too often,

490
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,759
do we?

491
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,759
Yeah.

492
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,759
I probably should say it more.

493
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,759
That's probably why I'm crying because I haven't said it enough to them.

494
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:11,140
But yeah, I think if you are a good leader, you learn it from someone and just all the

495
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,759
qualities that I have, good and bad, I've obviously learned from them.

496
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,779
But yeah, just from both, like my dad's super hardworking, committed, dedicated, persistent,

497
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,839
and then my mom's like a beautiful angel with a kind, compassionate side.

498
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:33,339
So I guess it was a perfect mix and all my siblings kind of have different traits, different

499
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,839
characteristics from all of them and hopefully we're all pretty good people.

500
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,839
I've got no doubt that's the case.

501
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,839
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration and love the idea of inspiring these connections

502
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,839
to the leader.

503
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,339
And in that sense, I mean, you've clearly life of basketball success and it may be where

504
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,339
you go or another part of your life.

505
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,839
Have you thought about, God, I'd love to, that's a person I'd love to connect or collaborate

506
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,839
with in any way?

507
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,839
Any part of your life?

508
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,839
Is there a name that springs to mind?

509
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,839
Oh, great question.

510
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,839
There's so many.

511
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,839
Great leader.

512
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,839
I really love Kelsey Griffin from the Bendigo Spirit who plays basketball.

513
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:01,839
I mean, I've had a couple in the group, honestly, but I'd love to pick Pat Cummins, brain.

514
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,839
I know he's a bigger leader connect.

515
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,839
I listened to all the podcasts and stuff and everything that he's on.

516
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,839
Oh, I had this answer prepared and now I'm in the moment.

517
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,839
I can't think of the right word.

518
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,839
I can't think of the right word.

519
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,839
I can't think of the right word.

520
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,839
I can't think of the right word.

521
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,839
I can't think of the right word.

522
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,839
I can't think of the right word.

523
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,839
I can't think of the right word.

524
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,839
I can't think of the right word.

525
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:30,019
Great leaders.

526
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:33,920
I would love to, like, obviously LeBron James is my basketball hero.

527
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,279
So, to be able to be in the same room as him.

528
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,559
Brianna Stewart.

529
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,599
I think there's so many great ladies with great strengths.

530
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:42,779
Yeah.

531
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,839
um and weaknesses but you often see that the best leaders have the same things in common so

532
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,940
um anyone that's really been at the top of their craft i would really love to pick their brain

533
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,839
