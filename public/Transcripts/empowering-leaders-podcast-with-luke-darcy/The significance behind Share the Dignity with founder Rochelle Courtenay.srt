00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,929
Rochelle Courtney is a remarkable individual supporting and changing the lives of vulnerable

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,470
women around Australia and the world. Have a listen to Rochelle share her story of how difficult

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:20,629
it still is in mainstream media to talk about the topic of periods for women and even more so period

4
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:26,070
poverty. She shares the joy of having NRL players volunteer in the warehouse packing sanitary

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,210
products for women and the passion and joy that that provides. She has a really clear, simple way

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,329
of communicating the message of her charity Share the Dignity. A remarkable Australian who went from

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,649
spending six months in jail to being awarded and recognised for her leadership. It's people like

8
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:48,009
Rochelle Courtney who inspire the work we do at Alita and specifically our signature program

9
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:54,030

You can book a discovery call. Myself or Matt will jump on a call with you personally

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,349
and share with you our passion for what it's like to bring together different leaders from

15
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:21,769
different backgrounds to learn, to connect and to share. Huge thank you as always to Jason Nicholas

16
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,629
and the team at Temper Bedding supporting conversations like this on the Empowering

17
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:31,349
Leaders podcast. We're incredibly grateful. Temper, a mattress like no other. NASA approved.

18
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:36,890
FaceAge technology. I sleep on a temper mattress every night and it is simply life-changing.

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,810
Leaders like Rochelle and those that have consistent success in their lives all understand

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,650
the value of sleep. In fact, we hear Rochelle talk about eight hours of sleep being one of the

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,390
things that she makes sure happens every night. Invest in a temper mattress. It will change your

22
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,849
life. Rochelle Courtney is the founder and managing director of women's charity, Share the

23
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,469
Dignity. Share the Dignity makes a real difference in the lives of those experiencing homelessness,

24
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,950
fleeing domestic violence or doing it tough by distributing period products for women,

25
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,889
girls and anyone that menstruates that needs support. Share the Dignity partners with over

26
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:18,030
3,000 charities nationally and has over 6,000 volunteers Australia-wide. Rochelle was recently

27
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,169
awarded the 2023 Australian Award for Excellence in Women's Leadership. Rochelle has made this

28
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:27,169
outstanding contribution despite suffering her own family history of domestic violence

29
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:31,449
and making a serious error of judgment that resulted in her pleading guilty to fraud,

30
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:36,689
having to sell the family home to make restitution, serving six months in a women's prison.

31
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,009
Rochelle, thanks for joining me today and can I firstly say congratulations on your award,

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,810
really well deserved. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate your time. I have won awards for

33
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,210
other things like humanitarian awards but never a leadership award so it's quite humbling to be

34
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,030
there with some of those amazing women that have previously received those awards. Yeah,

35
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,150
what a great, great story. If I could go back, Rochelle, to the start,

36
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:06,389
you're incredibly open about this but over 13 years ago you had to leave your daughters behind

37
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,330
to serve six months in the Brisbane women's prison. It's an incredible story for me to see

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,969
you go from there, standing on the stage, as you just said, receiving an award for excellence in

39
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,810
women's leadership. Can you share with us what led you to ending up in jail and how

40
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,490
you found a way to achieve so much? I think the major thing for me when I was

41
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,409
a waif, I could have been anywhere in the world on a desert island on a beautiful,

42
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:41,370
being taken away from my two daughters was the worst part of all of it. I recently saw Liz Ellis

43
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,729
win for I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here and she will say to you the most painful bit

44
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:54,050
was being away from her children. I didn't get that choice. That choice was put on me because

45
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,990
of my errors and so that was a really hefty price for me to pay but it was also a really hefty price

46
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,449
for my children to have to pay. I think it's a really hefty price for me to have to pay.

47
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:09,629
Michelle, you find yourself then, from what you read, it's an incredibly confronting experience.

48
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:16,410
I can't speak to it. The research says that most people who are incarcerated for any length of

49
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,290
time, their outcomes are significantly worse afterwards than it often is the start of a

50
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,149
spiral downwards. Your story is incredible. You have defied the odds. Where did you find

51
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:31,370
that resilience and that courage? People make mistakes.

52
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,769
I was one of those people who made mistakes and to not let it define me was what I was always

53
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:45,430
going to do. It wasn't why I started the charity. That was not the reason. I just found a problem

54
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,810
in Australia that I didn't know existed and was really embarrassed that the problem had not been

55
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:58,269
rectified. I think that there is so much shame when it comes to my past that finding a way

56
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,449
to heal myself from that was probably,

57
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:08,889
the hardest part of it all. I know that sitting in jail with those women, a lot of those women

58
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:16,110
are on a revolving door and a lot of those women come from families with trauma involved in their

59
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,790
past. If you don't ever fix that trauma for them, then that's why they're going to keep

60
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,029
returning in there. I know some ladies that were in there were there for the winter.

61
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,209
They would simply offend so that they had somewhere to live.

62
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,970
How do we create a better world where that doesn't happen?

63
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:41,149
Michelle, did you find that sitting in there and understanding those stories as you described,

64
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:45,730
what you just said then is just horrific and horrible, isn't it? The best alternative to

65
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,110
have a warm place is to commit a crime to end up in jail. When you think about that in

66
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,189
a wealthy country like Australia, it's terrible. Did that spark something in you in wanting

67
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,290
to help women in need?

68
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,290
Michelle Miller

69
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:06,730
I think the one story that there was, I think I became from an extrovert. I'd always been

70
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,569
an extrovert. I became an absolute introvert in there and I just sat and listened and I

71
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:22,410
think it was scary. There's no doubt that I was terrified, but I was exceptionally hurt

72
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,730
to not be around my kids. I was a single mother that had never spent a day, not spent very

73
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,050
much time away from my children.

74
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,050
Michelle Miller

75
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,550
But just to sit and listen and to hear this one woman, I will try to recall it without

76
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:42,170
crying, screaming on a phone because her parents had, her children had been returned to her

77
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:48,230
parents and her father abused her as a child, and so she'd run away, turned to drugs. She

78
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:56,290
tried to keep her children as far from possible away from her father. Just to hear that scream

79
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,050
and then just to sit there and listen to that child, it was horrible. I was afraid. I was

80
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,050
not aware of the consequences. I was holding on to my children, but I was scared because

81
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,050
I was so scared of them. I was so scared. I was so scared of them. I was so scared of them.

82
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,649
Literally, I was just patting her on the back and she was just telling the story and I was just like, how does this happen?

83
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,670
She's here for drug charges, but if we really unpacked it, what was it all about?

84
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:20,769
It was about her being sexually assaulted as a young girl and then the scream was that she didn't want that to happen to her children.

85
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,290
It's a tragic story, isn't it?

86
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,769
I can hear the emotion as you tell it and to experience that firsthand.

87
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,290
You're right, Rochelle, isn't it?

88
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,170
It's going back to where these things start, isn't it?

89
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,149
Often you end up with these people and they become outcasts.

90
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,470
The polite society, as we call it, say, okay, you're too hard then to deal with, aren't you?

91
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:46,769
You've been to jail, very hard to get employed, isn't it, if you've got a history of being incarcerated?

92
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,709
We just start to snowball, often from people who've experienced horrific things in their childhood.

93
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,269
It's the...

94
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,769
The unfairness of it is pretty profound, isn't it?

95
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,170
Yeah, you know, we're all quick to judge too, right?

96
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,949
We're all quick to judge that person sitting on the side of the streets or somebody who's addicted to drugs.

97
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:10,170
But, you know, I will tell you, if you just sit with them, you will hear and listen and learn.

98
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:16,470
And I just wish, as an Australia, that we would understand that and learn to do better.

99
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,029
Rochelle, the Share the Dignity story is incredible.

100
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,170
And as I was preparing for this interview...

101
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,949
I thought there's still something, you know, even for males, you know, uncomfortable talking about women and their periods.

102
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:34,549
And it's not something that we naturally sit around as part of life as it is.

103
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:42,090
Do you think that was part of why no one had done what you'd done and understood just how terrible this was for women in need?

104
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,269
That there isn't really mainstream discussion about it enough?

105
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:51,830
Yeah, I think that if you think about what can of worms I opened...

106
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,230
I was talking about periods when...

107
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:55,990
No one was talking about periods and poverty.

108
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,429
No one talks about poverty.

109
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,889
Mix them two together and bam, we've got something that no one wanted to be part of, right?

110
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:14,590
So, but for me, I always believed that there wasn't a person in Australia who wouldn't be empathetic to hearing that a woman was using socks or newspaper or wadded up toilet paper to deal with their period.

111
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,490
And when I first read that first article, I was like, oh my God, that is so embarrassing that I'd never ever thought of that, right?

112
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,269
And I'd suffered.

113
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,049
I'd suffered severely from endometriosis.

114
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,750
So for me, periods were a really bad part of my life.

115
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,509
So if I didn't suffer from endometriosis, would I probably have started the charity?

116
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,769
I probably wouldn't have because I wasn't...

117
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:45,210
I wouldn't have had that severe empathy to periods being a really negative part of your life.

118
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,370
And then imagine that and then not being able to afford sanitary items.

119
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,250
So, you know, I think that starting it was about...

120
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:56,190
I just can't believe that no one would want to do anything about it.

121
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,330
I think that whole leadership piece comes from just taking people on your journey to make sure that we can be part of the solution.

122
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,269
And I love what you said to me just before, you know, we set it low and started recording.

123
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:14,690
You said, I've just come from having eight NRL players pack sanitary products for women, which I love, isn't it?

124
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:22,590
The stereotype I played the other code, Australian Rules Football, was that, you know, big meathead footy players don't have any sense of care.

125
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,710
Yeah.

126
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,450
I love the fact that you've got them working in the charity.

127
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,490
How often does that happen?

128
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,029
Well, a couple of times a year.

129
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,789
I mean, we literally just heard from them the other day and said that they said the boys want to come in and volunteer again.

130
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:37,950
And we're like, not very far from that.

131
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,950
Like, it's incredible.

132
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:47,610
And the conversations that happen around as we're packing and doing things are really, you know, we've come a really long way.

133
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,509
And, you know, I think it's really important to understand that this is not a female's issue.

134
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:53,809
This is society's issue.

135
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,049
We are talking about periods and periods.

136
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,789
If you don't get your period, you come from somebody who did, right?

137
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,610
So they are relative to everybody.

138
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,750
Yeah, well said.

139
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:03,830
That's right.

140
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:10,309
Or you live with your wife and your daughters and it's as natural a part of life as anything.

141
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:14,590
You mentioned Liz Ellis before, who I feel lucky to call a great friend.

142
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,769
And I've known Liz for a long time, worked with Liz.

143
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,909
Australian netball royalty and just a champion and all around.

144
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:21,990
Yeah.

145
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:27,450
She won I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here and Share the Dignity was where she chose her $100,000.

146
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:34,250
And I thought it was worth playing Liz's explanation of why Share the Dignity has resonated so much.

147
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,070
Let's have a listen to Liz Ellis.

148
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:44,250
Look, I think Share the Dignity is so important because they provide much needed period products to women who are fleeing domestic violence,

149
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,490
who are homeless, who are struggling to make ends meet.

150
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,649
And with the rising cost of living, demand on this particular charity is greater than ever.

151
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,490
But they provide.

152
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,509
Sanitary packs to women who need them through 3000 charities across Australia.

153
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,509
They lobbied the government to remove the luxury tax on on period products.

154
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,509
And now they're lobbying to make sure that period products are available for free for women in public hospitals.

155
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,909
So it's one of those things we don't talk about enough.

156
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,509
You know, period is something that affects 50% of the adult population for 25% of their lives.

157
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,710
And if women can't access these products to help them be dignified, it affects their family.

158
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,710
It affects their life.

159
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:21,710
So Share the Dignity.

160
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,009
Really does hand people back their dignity in these really trying moments.

161
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,509
So I'm really proud to be able to say that, you know, $100,000 is going to them.

162
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:38,389
They've got plans on making sure they continue to stock their dignity vending machines so that women can access these products without having to ask or beg.

163
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,129
So I just love the work they do.

164
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:48,470
So listening to that back, Rochelle, from Liz Ellis, it must be rewarding for you to have this growing community of high profile support.

165
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,330
What does that mean to you?

166
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,370
I think when Liz Ellis talked about periods on national TV, I cried.

167
00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:08,929
I cried because, to be honest, even to this day, eight days, eight years after I've started the charity, never have we been invited to speak about period poverty or Share the Dignity on any of the morning TV shows or the nighttime.

168
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,690
They won't talk about icky things on TV while people are having their breakfast or their night.

169
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,169
So for us to hear Liz openly talking about periods on a show.

170
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,049
You know, millions of people are watching.

171
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,009
We were so proud.

172
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,590
So the money is one thing, but the conversation is where the power is, right?

173
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:29,450
And I love having worked with Liz.

174
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,190
She calls a spade a shovel, Liz.

175
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,029
There's no gray with her.

176
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,470
You know exactly where you stand.

177
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:47,049
And I had the pleasure of working on the netball with her and not surprised that she's jumped in behind your great cause and just articulated that, as you said.

178
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,970
And I hadn't thought of it in that context, Rochelle.

179
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,549
Isn't it funny, isn't it?

180
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,529
You know, the big, big audiences in the morning find it too difficult to have this conversation.

181
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,450
It's not a great reflection on us, is it?

182
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,129
We're not, you know, you're making a big dent in it.

183
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:05,309
And that helps, doesn't it, when someone like Liz on primetime gives it the space?

184
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,230
Absolutely.

185
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:15,509
The only time that I've been invited to be on the Today Show was when we were fighting to remove the GST on our luxurious sanitary items.

186
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,230
But I think that conversation, we were allowed on the couch.

187
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,549
We were allowed on the couch because we were talking about money and not about periods, right?

188
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,110
Yeah, well, there you go, isn't it?

189
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,190
There's obviously a formula that needs to change.

190
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,389
So I will feel enlightened by this conversation.

191
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,470
I'm glad that you're doing it in such a profound way.

192
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,269
Can I ask the leadership question for you?

193
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,470
You're now running a big organization, as I mentioned in the intro.

194
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,590
That's 3,000 charities to collaborate with, 6,000 volunteers.

195
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,309
That is a significant enterprise in whatever space you call it.

196
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,309
What sort of leadership?

197
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,769
What sort of leadership qualities have you found within yourself?

198
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,710
Look, I, like Liz, have played netball all my life until I was 50.

199
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,149
So I only retired after my knee surgeon said no more.

200
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,570
So for me, I pull lots of my leadership skills from having played and coached netball.

201
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,250
I just believe that, you know, we were talking earlier, it takes a team of people to be able to make the magic happen.

202
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:19,250
So for me, leadership is about bringing the energy and bringing solutions to the problems but surrounding yourself.

203
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,649
So I think that's the most important thing that I can do.

204
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:22,850
I think that's the most important thing that I can do.

205
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,590
So I think that's the most important thing that I can do.

206
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,289
So I do not want to look at smart sheets and work out how to do that.

207
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:32,029
But I absolutely surround myself with people who have that skill set.

208
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:49,269
So I think making it easy for people to volunteer, making it easy for people to donate and making it easy for our corporates to come on board is probably, you know, my highest skill strength is like time is the most precious resource any of us have.

209
00:15:49,649 --> 00:16:01,169
And so, you know, as a mum, as a juggler of many things, that was probably my highest leadership piece was making sure that we all could do what we needed to do with the best amount of time that we have.

210
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:04,710
And can I just break that down a bit because that's interesting to me.

211
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,330
And that is a great skill set, isn't it?

212
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:13,570
Making something that looks like a complex challenge and that is how do you distribute, you know, sanitary products Australia-wide?

213
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,789
How do you find the people?

214
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,950
How do you get the products to them?

215
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,250
And, you know, you just said that really simplistic.

216
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,289
How did you go about it?

217
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,529
Because that is often harder than it sounds.

218
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,009
Yeah, well, it is a logistical, a massive logistical beast.

219
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:34,350
But I will tell you that the same framework that I set up at the very beginning, we are still using eight years down the track.

220
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,009
So we have volunteer state team leaders and then they have a team underneath them.

221
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:49,250
If you donate in any Woolworths in March in, say, Bendigo, Ballarat, Tasmania, wherever they are, they stay in that central location.

222
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:57,450
Our volunteers go in, pick them up, then they register them on the phone what they've picked up and then the app tells them which charity to take them to.

223
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,169
So we've made it as simple as possible.

224
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,069
If I can't do it, I'm not expecting anybody else to do it, right?

225
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:04,930
Brilliant.

226
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,289
And I love it.

227
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:14,750
I want to just shift slightly gear and go back to you being a mother of your own two daughters and I'm sure they're incredibly proud of you.

228
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,990
I'm always fascinated by leadership on the home front.

229
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,990
What's your style?

230
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:20,049
What's your style there as a mother?

231
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,309
I now have grandchildren as well.

232
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,470
So my daughters are 25 and 24.

233
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:36,910
So mine was about making sure that they felt safe and heard and that we were always a team.

234
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,910
So we were always a team.

235
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,910
So if we were – I didn't clean and they made the mess.

236
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,269
We were a team always.

237
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:49,170
So we always turned Thursday afternoons, we turned the music on and we would all divide and conquer the chores.

238
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,890
So that we never had to do any housework on the weekend.

239
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,809
That was our retreat.

240
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:59,589
If you wore the piece of clothing, then we washed everything, put them in the centre and you wore it, you folded it and put it away.

241
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,869
So for me, it's always been about – it's about teamwork is the dream work.

242
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,990
And so, yeah, I think that's probably always been my thing.

243
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:12,970
And always – I've always taught my daughters never ask somebody to do something for you that you can do yourself.

244
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,369
Yeah, great.

245
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,549
A bit of wisdom there, isn't it, Rochelle, isn't it?

246
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:17,470
It's a challenge, isn't it?

247
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,049
We often do so much for them out of luck.

248
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:24,329
But then not leave them with any skill sets at the end when it's time to grow up.

249
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:24,789
And I love that.

250
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,130
It's a great way to frame it.

251
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,289
Oh, sorry.

252
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,089
I always said that my children are adults for a lot longer than they are children.

253
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,450
So make them great adults.

254
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,690
Yeah, well said.

255
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,829
And I love the teamwork aspect.

256
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,150
Often we talk about chores and the hierarchy.

257
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,230
And that, you know, is a challenge.

258
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:42,349
And I find my own four kids, you try – you know, you get frustrated.

259
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:43,289
Why don't you do this?

260
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,750
Why don't you – but I haven't thought of it through that lens, isn't it?

261
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:46,509
Now, we're a team.

262
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,509
Let's do this together.

263
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,470
Put some music on.

264
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,250
And make it happen.

265
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:51,250
I love it.

266
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,950
Yeah, beautifully said.

267
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,390
I don't think they always enjoyed it.

268
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:53,910
Trust me.

269
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:57,410
But, you know, it was about you can't go anywhere on the weekend.

270
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,769
None of us can go and do what we want to do on the weekends.

271
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,990
And most of our days Saturday were as a netball, right?

272
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,609
So, you know, let's just get it out of the way.

273
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,390
Hey, Rochelle, I've loved the experience of talking to people in different settings.

274
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,789
And yours is such a brilliant, unique space you contribute to.

275
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:17,269
And for us, in the leadership work we do, we love working with diverse leaders.

276
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,269
And we think there's –

277
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,750
There's some patterns of leadership that show up.

278
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,150
And I want to ask you about some dimension.

279
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,109
Starting with the idea of self-leadership,

280
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,470
I feel like yours is an incredible story of self-leadership.

281
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,569
What does that mean to you?

282
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,950
Self-leadership for me means about having my recipe of life under control.

283
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:37,490
And that recipe of life changes.

284
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,450
And for me now, it's about getting a good eight hours sleep.

285
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,630
Otherwise, you do not want to be anywhere near me.

286
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,869
That makes me the best version of me.

287
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,309
But also making sure that I get my walk in,

288
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,309
that I get to get to the gym, that I get to spend time with my kids

289
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,609
and my grandkids more so, and that I get to do some of the things

290
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,890
that spark joy for me so it's not just all emails and meetings

291
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,769
because otherwise, you know, life is short.

292
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,710
But that's about – and that for me, I have 20 staff here

293
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,730
and we have, you know, quite a big volunteer team leader.

294
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,450
I'm always talking to them about you can't be the best version of you

295
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,230
if you're not turning up.

296
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,690
So I can't ask you if you're not booking in holidays

297
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,170
and having things to look forward to and making sure that if, you know,

298
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,970
being at the gym or going for walks is important to you

299
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,809
and you're not doing that, then that's not bringing your best version of you

300
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,549
to your week, to your day, to your workplace.

301
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,950
Yeah, it's a great explanation for us.

302
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,309
And I was thinking of that analogy, isn't it?

303
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:41,690
You've got to, you know, put the oxygen mask on yourself first

304
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,349
before you can help anyone else really.

305
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:43,710
Absolutely.

306
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,250
If you don't do that and, you know, I can clearly see you apply that throughout.

307
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,529
Not in your own life, but pass that on in your organisation,

308
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,490
which is really powerful because it's not something that people get sometimes,

309
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:54,890
isn't it?

310
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,150
If you can't start with your own routines yourself, it's hard to impact others.

311
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,930
Speaking of impact others and Share the Dignity is doing that on a massive scale

312
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,190
and a beautiful story, but we see leaders are really conscious on a daily basis

313
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,630
of how they positively impact everyone in their environment.

314
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,269
How would you describe your version of that?

315
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:18,150
For me, my version is –

316
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,910
I would describe it as appreciation, making sure that our volunteers completely feel appreciated.

317
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:29,369
And I literally was spending time with a volunteer in Perth, our WA team leader this week,

318
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:35,009
and she said – she's a very successful OAM, is a CEO, and she said,

319
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:39,509
I come to Share the Dignity to feel appreciated and to get my cup full.

320
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,670
And I'm like, oh my God, she's so accomplished.

321
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,390
She said she feels appreciated at Share the Dignity.

322
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,509
And I would hope that that translates to everybody.

323
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,769
Everybody, every volunteer in our organisation.

324
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,869
Yeah, what a great story, isn't it?

325
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,650
It's that intangible, isn't it?

326
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:59,849
People are turning up who run their own businesses to get the community through Share the Dignity.

327
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,170
You've done something pretty special there, and no wonder it's such a success.

328
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,809
Really, this next dimension is about leaders creating and sharing their vision in a really clear way.

329
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:16,950
I mean, your vision has been a powerful one that no one had really seen that before and gone about it.

330
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,450
How did you go?

331
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,849
How did you go about creating and sharing that vision?

332
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:21,609
Probably through storytelling.

333
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:29,309
I think the most powerful thing that we can do as leaders is over-communicate and keep communicating to them about what our –

334
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,490
you know, sharing the stories, hearing the stories of a young girl who's experiencing homelessness and stealing socks,

335
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:39,529
making sure that we're constantly connecting our why to why they give their time,

336
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,630
even why people donate, even why corporations, big corporates help us.

337
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,490
It has to be – it has to come back to why do they choose us.

338
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,069
Because there's a lot of charities in Australia, right?

339
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,390
And the personal storytelling for you has always been the most powerful.

340
00:22:54,589 --> 00:23:00,349
When you actually personalise it and hear the story of a young girl, is that what resonates?

341
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,769
Yeah, absolutely.

342
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:09,049
And I think there is – I can still tell stories from six years ago that I've heard, and I still will get goosebumps and cry.

343
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:17,490
So, you know, it's that – for me, that authentic leadership and that authentic voice that comes through, I hope, in everything that we do at Share the Dignity.

344
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,650
See, leaders like you are having a great impact, really curious,

345
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:28,950
and curiosity is often the jumping-off point for how people like you approach their learning and development.

346
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,569
What does curiosity mean for you?

347
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,390
I am always reading, and I'm always looking at ways that we can do things better.

348
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,470
We have a very good phrase here that I say, we don't make mistakes here, we just learn to do things better.

349
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,490
And so, you know, you learn from your mistakes.

350
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,809
That's what life's about, right?

351
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:52,009
I don't want to make any big monumental mistakes anymore like I have in my past.

352
00:23:52,289 --> 00:24:07,829
But for me, it's about I always think in what we're doing here is sometimes just do it because we're trying to fix a solution to be able to make sure that other people just have the very basic of essentials, right?

353
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,990
So what really could go wrong?

354
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:11,990
What could possibly go wrong?

355
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:12,430
I love it.

356
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:19,410
And I was just as you're talking, I was talking about the mistake supportive environment that you've created.

357
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:24,490
I was talking to Ruddick Sully on this podcast, one of the creators and founders of Swiss Vitamins.

358
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:31,329
And they had a really sophisticated language around celebrating, making mistakes, wanted their team to do it.

359
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,170
And they turned it into something really, really powerful.

360
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,789
LSIs is what he called it.

361
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:39,789
I'm going to muck it up.

362
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,130
I was looking for my notes.

363
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,410
But have a listen to Ruddick's podcast.

364
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:49,069
Because one of their team had a monumental mistake and described it as a learning experience and it became their culture.

365
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,650
And it sounds like you've captivated that in a similar way.

366
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,390
You mentioned communicate, communicate, communicate.

367
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:58,609
We see that as a really common trait of leaders as well.

368
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,450
How have you gone about that?

369
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,349
We use Workplace.

370
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,809
So we are really lucky to be able to video content to all of our volunteers.

371
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,809
For example, if...

372
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,109
Hope Transport, who help us move product all around Australia.

373
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:19,930
I will always do about two or three videos straight to their staff.

374
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,390
So they understand the impact and share a story.

375
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,910
But there's many ways that we communicate.

376
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,150
We don't just do it through written communication.

377
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,049
We do it in video.

378
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,490
There's so many different ways to communicate now, right?

379
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:32,730
So we use them all.

380
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,710
So Workplace, is that an app?

381
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,009
It's like Facebook, but it's a closed workplace for our charity.

382
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,410
So organizations use it around Australia.

383
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,349
Around the world.

384
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,910
We were one of the first charities to use it when it came in in 2016.

385
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,490
It allows us to be able to break down communication.

386
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,509
So there is a WA.

387
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,369
There is an overall team of the six and a half thousand volunteers.

388
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,690
Then there is a communication group just for WA in each state.

389
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,390
And then that breaks it down even further into other littler groups.

390
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,529
So it's quite specific.

391
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,450
And all your team will log on to Workplace

392
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,349
and see that as their hub for finding out,

393
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:13,549
where the information sits.

394
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:13,970
Absolutely.

395
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:21,549
And I know I every day send five messages of gratitude to our volunteers.

396
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:24,950
And so I can always just send a message directly.

397
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:26,049
It's a little bit like Facebook.

398
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,109
So it's, yeah, it's in there.

399
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:29,769
Your five messages of gratitude.

400
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,990
I'm interested in that.

401
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,509
So what does that look and sound like?

402
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:37,730
So every day I will send something to somebody.

403
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,329
Like I know that this morning I sent one to Anu,

404
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,730
who is a...

405
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:44,670
Shiro in New South Wales,

406
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,470
who went out to a school to speak for Share the Dignity.

407
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,470
I can't be everywhere.

408
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,890
So, you know, like I just saw that in Workplace

409
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,529
where she'd put the picture and I just sent her a message and said,

410
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,849
I think, you know, I want to thank you and I appreciate you.

411
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,430
It doesn't need to be complex.

412
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,190
It just needs to be that they feel seen and heard.

413
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:04,630
And yeah, I'm really lucky to be surrounded by so many amazing people

414
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,509
and be on their team.

415
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,170
Yeah.

416
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,569
And you mentioned that.

417
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,049
And that links to the other dimension I want to talk to you about

418
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:11,670
was the sense of collaboration.

419
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,769
And we see leaders now really sophisticated in how they collaborate.

420
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,789
And clearly you're doing that on scale.

421
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,849
How important has that collaboration been for you?

422
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:21,750
Yeah.

423
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,650
Look, especially when you come to big global problems

424
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,349
like what we're trying to fix, I think collaboration is everything.

425
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:34,130
So we collaborate with three and a half thousand charities

426
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,470
because we couldn't actually get the period products

427
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,430
to the woman who's living on the street or fled domestic violence.

428
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,430
So it was really important for that collaboration,

429
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,549
collaboration piece to happen.

430
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:47,009
So, and then our volunteers collaborate with that charity

431
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:48,950
and then make relationships with them.

432
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,750
But we, you know, we've even done that on a global scale.

433
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,849
We held a global period poverty forum here in Australia

434
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,650
with people who've been working in this space around the world.

435
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,569
Never before have they all been brought together to try to work out

436
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:05,430
how could we eradicate period poverty around the world?

437
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,329
So, you know, collaboration is our middle name.

438
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,650
It is about everything that we do because we can't solve these.

439
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,490
We can't solve these problems on our own.

440
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,349
And I always think that 10 heads thinking about a problem is better than one.

441
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,569
Yeah, beautifully said.

442
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,569
But asking these two questions, Rochelle,

443
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:25,549
to all the brilliant people like you that I've had the pleasure of sitting down with,

444
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,450
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

445
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,210
Sharon Baker, who was my net pool coach when I was 16.

446
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:34,130
I love it.

447
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,170
I love there was not even a pause there.

448
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,529
Tell us about Sharon Baker.

449
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,630
Why did she have such an influence on you?

450
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,630
I just think she came...

451
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,849
She communicated really well.

452
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,450
She respected us as 15-year-olds.

453
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,089
And I think it made such an impact on who I was as a netball coach,

454
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,390
who I was as a mother.

455
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,990
I just...

456
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,349
I think that she's the first leader that I ever came across that led people

457
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,609
to do what give you outcomes.

458
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:06,769
So for me, everybody else had coached and they were always mums

459
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:09,410
and they were doing the best that they could,

460
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,289
but they were probably shoved into that job.

461
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:11,529
But yeah...

462
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,809
Yeah, I just think that, yeah.

463
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,509
Sharon just taught me some skills that I took through all of my life.

464
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:19,630
Well, great shout out to Sharon Baker.

465
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,609
And I love it, Rochelle, because I'm really passionate.

466
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,029
They're a father of four.

467
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,430
And sometimes a junior sporting coach can change your life

468
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,630
or a teacher or someone in a space that you love.

469
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,369
And it's a love that you've referenced that

470
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:38,049
because it is so important we get that right for our kids, isn't it?

471
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,789
If it's a happy place, it's really, really powerful.

472
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,150
Same vein.

473
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:44,009
We are passionate about collaboration.

474
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,069
We have a leadership business, a leader connect,

475
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,809
and we connect leaders from around the globe.

476
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,789
And so fascinated and passionate about collaboration.

477
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,250
If you could collaborate, Rochelle, with anyone on anything,

478
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,809
is there a name that springs to mind?

479
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,509
It might be in the Share the Dignity space.

480
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,130
It might be in another area of passion.

481
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,750
Is there someone that springs to mind?

482
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,269
Brene Brown.

483
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:05,950
I just...

484
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,630
I mean, I've read everything, but for me and for a lot of women,

485
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:11,450
there is such...

486
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,690
You know, that whole piece around being in the arena

487
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,650
and, you know, not thinking that you are good enough to be where...

488
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,930
You know, I will stand on the stage and accept an award

489
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,670
and I will absolutely be on the inside dying

490
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,109
because I don't believe that I should be there.

491
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,690
This imposter syndrome, no matter how much I try to overcome it,

492
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,490
and, you know, it is a real thing for women

493
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,109
and I would love to work with her further on...

494
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,430
Not me, but all of our volunteers and women in general.

495
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,789
Yeah, you know, beautifully said.

496
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:49,750
And what an impact she's had, Brene Brown.

497
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,809
And it's funny you say, for the incredible women like you

498
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,250
that I had the pleasure of speaking with and working with in recent times,

499
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,329
it's a real thing, isn't it?

500
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,509
You know, incredibly capable people and that is alive and well.

501
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,589
I mean, males to a lesser extent.

502
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,410
It tends to be, you know, often women who are brilliant

503
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,829
that still feel as though they're not worthy.

504
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,430
And Brene Brown's been the superhero on that front, hasn't she?

505
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,849
But put that on the agenda.

506
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,349
Yeah, she certainly has.

507
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:17,329
She's read, you know, the books that I have read

508
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:20,289
and the podcasts that I've listened to

509
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,630
have really helped me be the best version of me.

510
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:26,710
But, you know, it still exists and I, you know,

511
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,470
would love to dig a little deeper.

512
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,609
Well, Michelle, congratulations again.

513
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,289
Share the Dignity is just a remarkable contribution to the community.

514
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,269
Australia, it sounds like globally what you're doing

515
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,470
is making a massive impact.

516
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,369
And, you know, I love...

517
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:43,890
You know, for me, it's sitting in that space

518
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,269
and understanding more about it.

519
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,650
And for us males, it's something we do need

520
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,430
to have better discussions about and understand.

521
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:51,170
And, you know, as you described beautifully,

522
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,269
we either came from someone who has a period

523
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:56,470
or we live with it every day.

524
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,670
So for us to hopefully do our part

525
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,809
is at least the minimum worthwhile thing we can do.

526
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,009
So more strength to your arm.

527
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,650
And, Rochelle, you deserve everything that comes your way.

528
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,890
And I'm not surprised you're winning awards everywhere.

529
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,750
And thanks for taking the time today.

530
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:12,349
Thank you so much.

00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,549
