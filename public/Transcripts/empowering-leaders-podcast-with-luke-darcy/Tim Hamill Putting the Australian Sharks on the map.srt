00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,049
Really enjoyed catching up with this week's guest

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,189
on the Empowering Leaders podcast, Tim Hamill,

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,689
the Australian men's water polo head coach,

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,830
fresh from an amazing result at the Paris Olympics.

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,309
You hear him talk about the win over powerhouse

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,989
of world water polo Serbia in the group stage,

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,230
which for me is close to the biggest upset

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,629
of the whole Olympic Games.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,870
A really important win for the history of our team.

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,629
When you're in the moment, you know,

11
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,629
you'd like to believe it's a very powerful victory,

12
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,109
but hearing some of our old boys speak on return,

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,369
they've spoken really nicely, in fact,

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,490
that they believe that may have been the biggest win

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,109
in Australian history, men's program-wise.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,130
So to be part of that was really, really special.

17
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,789
Tim is a very proud member of the Elite Connect family

18
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,810
and he talks about the importance of what that collaborative forum

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,549
has meant for him and his coaching.

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,090
To be truthful, Luke, it's been a phenomenal program

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,869
to be part of.

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,229
Wonderful learnings that I've taken out.

23
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,289
A wonderful opportunity to share challenges

24
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:00,609
and get some feedback on that.

25
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,070
Tim's got a great way of explaining his use

26
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,870
of imagery and storytelling.

27
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,829
He's a powerful tool in his coaching toolkit.

28
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,170
We were nervous as a group

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,310
and I gave a great deal of thought to, you know,

30
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,870
what can I do to try and settle the group

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,989
three hours before literally the biggest moment

32
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,250
of our lives, sporting-wise.

33
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,810
And I landed on sending the group via WhatsApp

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,129
a simple graphic or image.

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,430
And each of those graphics or image

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,329
framed up the theme for that evening's game.

37
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,230
We are really privileged

38
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,950
to have Tim Hamill,

39
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,390
the Australian men's water polo coach,

40
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,209
as part of our Elite Connect community.

41
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,530
We curate groups of five to six people

42
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,430
from around the globe

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,069
to come together to learn, to connect and to share.

44
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,609
You don't have to be an elite sporting coach

45
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:42,310
to be part of it.

46
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,930
We'd love to chat to you.

47
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:44,950

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,129
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas

and his team for Tempur Betting.

51
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,909

52
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:54,269
It's NASA approved.

54
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,829
Check out Tempur today.

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,340
Tim Hamill is the current head coach

56
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,280
of the Australian men's water polo team

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,260
fresh from an incredible performance

58
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,919
at the Paris Olympic Games.

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
Defeating the defending Olympic champion Serbia,

60
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,319
the host nation France

61
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,500
and world number two Hungary in the group stage

62
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,520
before an incredible quarterfinal

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,819
seven all tie against the United States

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,199
before going down in a penalty shootout.

65
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,000
Tim himself had an outstanding international career

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,919
representing Australia

67
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,699
at FINA World Championship level.

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,020
After retiring from competitive play,

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,960
Tim has made an enormous contribution

70
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,919
as a coach.

71
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,539
His attention to detail,

72
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,879
focus on culture and development,

73
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,960
all supporting his vision of Australia

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,460
competing with the world's best.

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,460
Great to catch up with you.

76
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,240
Great to be here, Luke.

77
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,460
It's a real honour to speak with you today.

78
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,099
I've listened to your podcast for a couple of years now.

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
So to be on the other end of it's a real honour for me.

80
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
And yeah, thank you for having me.

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,580
I heard you speak in the build up to Paris

82
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,180
of saying that you wanted the Australian men's water polo team

83
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,159
to shock the world.

84
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,300
I feel like you achieved that

85
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,319
when you reflect back on Paris,

86
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,400
what are your emotions?

87
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,340
Yeah, the shocking the world piece

88
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900
was a really important avenue for us to explore.

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,860
We are very much the underdogs in world water polo.

90
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,939
We've got the chip on the shoulder

91
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,840
as many Australians do as a team.

92
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,159
And we're really up against it,

93
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,240
against the powerhouses that are European water polo.

94
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,759
It was a really special journey for us.

95
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,439
And to be truthful with you,

96
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,479
it's the reflection post Paris

97
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,120
has been a really challenging one for me.

98
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,060
It'd be easy to sit back and enjoy the results,

99
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,319
which you mentioned a few moments ago,

100
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,979
but personally, for me as a coach,

101
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:36,780
it's been a struggle.

102
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,599
Yeah, it was a successful campaign in many measures,

103
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:46,000
but getting so close to a medal game

104
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,759
or playing for the medal for the first time

105
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,139
in Australian men's water polo history,

106
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,419
not getting there has left me quite a bit of taste in my mouth.

107
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,020
I remember immediately post game against USA,

108
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,240
I knew my words to the playing group

109
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,740
were going to be really, really important.

110
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,120
What to say, what not to say.

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
I ended up going down the path of,

112
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,139
you know, don't torture yourself, boys.

113
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,639
You know, we did it all in our power to get here today.

114
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,879
And what we've achieved is remarkable.

115
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,120
But I've found myself torturing myself

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,300
over the last couple of months.

117
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,279
Hopefully time will heal those wounds.

118
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,519
I had a great reflection session a couple of weeks ago

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,579
with a mentor of mine by the name of Toby Jenkins.

120
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,759
Where I landed with him was, Luke,

121
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,740
is I've used that yin-yang diagram

122
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,060
to try and get some peace out of the Olympic Games.

123
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,939
What that yin-yang means to me

124
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,160
is that, you know, there's a fair bit of white for us

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,199
in terms of good moments of the Olympic Games,

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,220
but there's that black dot

127
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,660
that sits quite defiantly in the middle of it.

128
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,040
And as I've landed on it,

129
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,420
for me, that's the price of entry at the Olympic Games.

130
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,439
And I'll move forward with that image in my mind

131
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,800
as an important one for us.

132
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,379
Can you give some context, Tim,

133
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,819
for those that maybe don't understand

134
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,779
the sport of water polo,

135
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,360
just how big it is in Europe,

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,420
particularly some of those Eastern European nations

137
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,360
that are perennial powerhouses,

138
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,060
Australia is a tiny island, really,

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
when you think about the funding that you get access to,

140
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,000
the trouble of, you know,

141
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,560
your players that do play overseas getting access to.

142
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Can you maybe just frame how big an uphill battle it is?

143
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,519
The easiest way to articulate it, Luke,

144
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,399
would be that it's a national sport in those countries.

145
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,139
So when you look at the NRL and the AFLs here in Australia,

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
water polo in many countries in Europe

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,019
are that in their respective countries.

148
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,920
So, you know,

149
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,379
yes, football and basketball are big,

150
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,680
but water polo in many of the countries

151
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,860
is their national sport.

152
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,819
We are very much an amateur team

153
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,439
playing against the professionals

154
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,060
and the big beasts of Europe.

155
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,379
You know, the players that we see in Australian sport

156
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,779
taking up the marketing dollars

157
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,180
and taking up the TV time,

158
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,800
they're all water polo players in Europe.

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
So what we try and do from a small island

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
down here in Australia with water polo ranked,

161
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,660
sadly, quite lowly on our sporting list here in Australia

162
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,459
is actually quite phenomenal.

163
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,939
To try and take on those giants of the world.

164
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,939
You took a squad that had 10 of 13

165
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,899
who were first-time Olympic debutants.

166
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,019
And I've got to go to the Serbia game there,

167
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,620
the reigning Olympic champions, a powerhouse.

168
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,620
You kept them to only three goals in an 8-3 victory.

169
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,480
And as someone like me watching on,

170
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,379
you just were blown away by what that performance meant.

171
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,860
Is that something you can build on

172
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,779
for the future of what you're trying to achieve?

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,819
A really important win for the history of our team.

174
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,600
When you're in the moment,

175
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,579
you'd like to believe it's a very powerful victory.

176
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,040
But hearing some of our old boys speak on return,

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
they've spoken really nicely, in fact,

178
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,439
that they believe that may have been the biggest win

179
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,060
in Australian history, men's program-wise.

180
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,060
So to be part of that was really, really special.

181
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,500
As you mentioned, we had 10 on debut, so 10 of 13.

182
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,980
And I must admit,

183
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,959
an inexperienced and young coaching group as well.

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,740
So the piece that I walk away from Paris most proud about

185
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,319
is how the playing group accepted,

186
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,459
and took on the big beast that is the Olympic Games.

187
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,980
I remember sitting there on the bench

188
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,139
as the players were getting introduced to the crowd.

189
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,300
And I dare say all of us, 13 players and five staff,

190
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,300
their emotions were extremely raw and open.

191
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,819
And to see the group, not five minutes after that,

192
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,240
be able to play in their biggest games of their lives

193
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
was really impactful on us.

194
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,060
How we did it's a question I've been asked a lot.

195
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,620
I'm not sure.

196
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,680
I've landed on a really simple answer to be truthful with you, Luke.

197
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,579
As with many teams, a lot's gone into it.

198
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,980
Great people involved.

199
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,959
I know one thing from a coaching point of view

200
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,519
that I tried to do a little bit differently

201
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,740
was the use of images to create our visions and themes.

202
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,860
We were nervous as a group.

203
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,759
And I gave a great deal of thought to,

204
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,540
what can I do to try and settle the group?

205
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,620
Three hours before,

206
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,939
literally the biggest moment of our lives, sporting-wise.

207
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,500
And I landed on sending the group via WhatsApp

208
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,819
a simple graphic or image.

209
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:01,699
And each of those images,

210
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,100
each of those graphics or image

211
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
framed up the theme for that evening's game.

212
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,839
So a couple of examples of those for you.

213
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,019
I sent them a photo of a four-leaf clover.

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,139
So we get into the meeting room

215
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,540
a couple of hours before the big game

216
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,500
and I asked them, what does that mean to you?

217
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,360
And some of the responses that came back

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
were humorous and entertaining.

219
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,939
But at that moment,

220
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,040
it wasn't so much about the four-leaf clover.

221
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,839
I just felt the energy in the room

222
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,620
and the mood really settled into a nice space.

223
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,519
The four-leaf clover, for what it's worth,

224
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,080
is the whole, you know,

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,940
when opportunity's knocking on your front door,

226
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,759
don't be in your backyard looking for four-leaf clovers.

227
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
And I said to the playing group that, you know,

228
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,720
the front door's being knocked at the moment.

229
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,159
Let's make sure we answer it.

230
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
We delve into Australian history

231
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,379
and we spoke about the battle at Villers-Bretonneux in 1914,

232
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,080
you know, prior to the French game.

233
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,179
And I certainly wasn't trying to evoke any war thoughts

234
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:53,840
because, you know,

235
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,580
our world's got too much of that at the moment.

236
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,919
But as you may be aware,

237
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,379
there's a famous sign that still exists in Villers-Bretonneux

238
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,539
about don't forget Australia.

239
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,480
And that city outside of Paris

240
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,200
hasn't forgotten Australia since that time.

241
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,220
And our theme for that night was

242
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,580
let's not make the French forget us after tonight.

243
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,019
We spoke about John Hendry,

244
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,340
the 19-year-old in Sydney Harbour,

245
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,220
for the Japanese attack

246
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,940
and the bravery that he showed.

247
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,440
So I tried to use these images to settle the group

248
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,460
and hopefully lighten the mood

249
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,440
leading into what was a, you know, big moment for us.

250
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
An Australian example we used was the cricket pitch.

251
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,399
So again,

252
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,399
it's Hungary and Hungarian water polo.

253
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,220
They're the most famous water polo country in the world.

254
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,340
And I sent the playing group a day five test match cricket pitch,

255
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,379
a photo of it.

256
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,820
Cracks all the way through it, uneven bounce.

257
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,299
And I asked them, what do you think this is for?

258
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,200
And again, we've got some humorous examples.

259
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,539
Light in the room started to come in.

260
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:56,480
And that one was about that if we give the Hungarians

261
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,639
a day one cricket pitch, a flat track, sun's out,

262
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,799
blue skies, they will beat us.

263
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,679
But our first moments and our first contacts in that game,

264
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,620
we need to present them with a day five pitch.

265
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,679
What does that look like from a water polo point of view?

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,820
It looks like this, this and this from a tactical point of view.

267
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,559
So I found those graphics that I ended up using

268
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,940
with the other coaches,

269
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,600
created a real lightness to the group

270
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,820
and hopefully settled their nerves

271
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,340
walking into some big moments for us.

272
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,759
Thanks for sharing.

273
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,600
It's brilliant.

274
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
It's someone who watches your sport,

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,259
but doesn't understand.

276
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,960
I can get that image of, it's David and Goliath, isn't it?

277
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,600
Really, as you said, you really need to do something

278
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,320
that unsettles the big giant.

279
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,840
And on paper, if everything goes well,

280
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,379
it's really a no contest probably.

281
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,080
But I love how you've been able to change the psychology

282
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,559
and release the tension at the same time,

283
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,740
but create an opportunity.

284
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,460
Is that what you've had to do,

285
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,080
given you are often coming up against these opponents

286
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,279
that no one expects you to win against?

287
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,639
The David and Goliath piece was exactly that.

288
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,259
We spoke about that.

289
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,240
And we didn't ignore that.

290
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,320
We knew the home crowd against the French

291
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,139
were going to be on their side,

292
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,080
but we really tried to flip things in our favour.

293
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,919
But going up against some of the powerhouses

294
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,059
was the challenge.

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,039
From a sporting context,

296
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,240
if we played really traditional water polo,

297
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,960
it's very unlikely that we would have been successful.

298
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,100
So one of our main mantras and vision pieces

299
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,000
for the three years was creating chaos.

300
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,500
So what that looks like for us is that

301
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,879
if a great white shark,

302
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,059
and we're known as the Aussie Sharks,

303
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,240
if a great white shark turns up to Bondi

304
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,700
Beach in the middle of summer

305
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,139
with 20,000 people around,

306
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,259
there's a fair bit of chaos that is going to be created.

307
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,259
So in terms of our style of play,

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,460
if we played very, very traditional water polo,

309
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,259
I dare say we wouldn't have won.

310
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,440
So our theme was very much about creating chaos

311
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
with our tactics that we use,

312
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,620
with our approach that we use.

313
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,480
I've since heard some of the players talk about,

314
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,779
you know, in the call room prior to the game.

315
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,639
And we're sitting there as a very inexperienced team,

316
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,559
10 on debut, as you mentioned,

317
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,120
against these, you know,

318
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,720
triple Olympic champions and four or 500 internationals,

319
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,360
three, four, five-time Olympians.

320
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,600
And we had some real characters in our team

321
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,240
that chose that moment to test out the opposition

322
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,259
from a point.

323
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,620
And there was some laughter and some joking

324
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,220
and some banter with the Australian team.

325
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,399
And we've since learned that, you know,

326
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,159
the Serbians or the Hungarians or the French

327
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,039
are looking at us like,

328
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
well, these guys are crazy.

329
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,740
Like, how can they be in this mood 10 minutes before

330
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,500
what will ultimately determine our success

331
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,360
in the Olympic Games?

332
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,000
So we're using,

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,059
we're using,

334
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,220
we're using,

335
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,659
we're using that whole David and Goliath piece

336
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,980
and the underdog piece to work in our advantage.

337
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:36,139
And I guess we tried to embrace as best we could

338
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,299
for the three-year cycle.

339
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,580
I heard some of your swimmers quoted throughout the games

340
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,419
that they felt like they were powerhouse swimmers

341
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,139
and that they could really hurt the opposition

342
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,220
with their swimming strength.

343
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,120
Was that another little one percenter

344
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,879
that you tried to instill in your group

345
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,659
that there was some competitive advantage

346
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:54,960
in their natural strength?

347
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:55,820
Absolutely.

348
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
For those who aren't aware,

349
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,720
water polo is very much like basketball,

350
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,200
where everyone goes up into it,

351
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,500
they'll attack,

352
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,299
and everyone comes down into defence.

353
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,100
So the European teams wish we'd play in a 15-metre pool

354
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
whereby they could attack or defend

355
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,620
and turn around and do the opposite,

356
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,320
whereby we would prefer to play in as long a pool as possible.

357
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,820
It's 30 metres at the moment,

358
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,740
but we had to be the fittest team at the Olympic Games

359
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,419
because if we weren't

360
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,600
and we went down very much a technical piece

361
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
against the Europeans,

362
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,500
again, we would have struggled.

363
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,220
So again, we're really clear from day one

364
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,980
that we were going to present at the Olympic Games

365
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,100
as the fittest,

366
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,259
and fastest team,

367
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,139
and it was hard work for the playing group

368
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,639
to get to that point,

369
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,720
but we certainly got there.

370
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,120
We spoke a lot about no 7 out of 10s,

371
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,320
which was another little framework we had,

372
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,899
and what the 7 out of 10 example for us was, Luke,

373
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,960
was that if you ask somebody

374
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,399
how's their day going out of 10,

375
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,480
and they tell you it's a 7 out of 10,

376
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,580
I would sit there and not really know

377
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,879
whether they're having a good or bad day.

378
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,100
If they said to me they're 6 out of 10,

379
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,720
then you know they're not having a good one.

380
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,179
If they said they're 8 out of 10,

381
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,159
you know they're having,

382
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,779
they're having a better day.

383
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,120
So from a training point of view,

384
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,059
we tried to not train at a 7 out of 10.

385
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,379
So we were clear that we needed to train

386
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,059
9 and 10 out of 10 at different times

387
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,259
to get to the level we needed to,

388
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,399
but we're also really comfortable

389
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,899
to head down to that 2 or 3 out of 10 moment

390
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,779
and enjoy our time, enjoy our training,

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,059
if and when we needed to,

392
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,340
and I believe that really helped us

393
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,820
because I think so often we try and mark time

394
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,279
and just get through session to session

395
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,299
and day to day and 7 out of 10s,

396
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,899
and ultimately I don't think we get

397
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,139
to peak physical fitness

398
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,320
if we approach it like that.

399
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,759
Yeah, what a great analogy

400
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,220
and a really clear thinking,

401
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,500
it sounds like, in all your coaching.

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,840
We've loved, Tim, having you

403
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,860
in our Elite and Connect program

404
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,399
and you've been in a group with Xavier Clark

405
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,559
from North Melbourne,

406
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:46,440
who's doing an amazing job as hopefully

407
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,639
AFL's first ever Indigenous senior coach.

408
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,200
It's great.

409
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,539
I hope that that will be the case.

410
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,580
Kenny Atkinson from the Golden State Warriors,

411
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,980
Aubrey Pleasant from the LA Rams,

412
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
Jacob Chance from Melbourne United,

413
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,159
and we bring these groups together.

414
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,200
This occasion,

415
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,220
it's an all-sporting group,

416
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,200
but non-competing sports around the globe.

417
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,639
Have you found that experience

418
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,940
of being able to share some of your wisdom

419
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,019
and learn from others?

420
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,460
To be truthful, Luke,

421
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,759
it's been a phenomenal program to be a part of.

422
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,879
The Elite and Connect and Elite family

423
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,000
is a great one,

424
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,360
and thank you for the work you do in that space.

425
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,759
Like many coaches,

426
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,620
you see that list of coaches

427
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,840
that you just presented there,

428
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,620
and Kenny Atkinson has since gone on

429
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,460
to be appointed Cleveland Cavaliers head coach,

430
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,620
so he only started last week

431
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,700
in his head coach capacity.

432
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,820
And I guess, you know,

433
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,360
to feel the imposter syndrome

434
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,759
start to rise in me

435
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,879
when you see that group,

436
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,340
you know, what can I offer to that group?

437
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,679
You know, they're far more versed than I am.

438
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,139
But being a part of those group

439
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,899
has been great for me.

440
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,039
Wonderful learnings that I've taken out,

441
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
a wonderful opportunity to share challenges

442
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,559
and get some feedback on that.

443
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,740
And I know even two weeks

444
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,940
before the Olympic Games,

445
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:53,460
I had a session with the Elite group,

446
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,960
and it would have been really easy

447
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,460
to not be a part of that,

448
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,940
given the games were just around

449
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,360
the corner.

450
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,259
But I find myself finishing

451
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,139
of those sessions

452
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,980
with a real lightness to me,

453
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,399
a real clarity of thinking,

454
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,080
and certainly enjoyment from it.

455
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,419
So yeah, wonderful piece of work

456
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,559
that we're involved with,

457
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,320
and yeah, absolutely helped my coaching.

458
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,879
And yeah, I hold those coaches

459
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,919
and Marley, our facilitator,

460
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,820
in great respect.

461
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,100
Yeah, Tim, I appreciate your feedback on that.

462
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,500
And I think the imposter syndrome

463
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,519
is something that is real for all of us

464
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,320
and never ceases to surprise me.

465
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,919
People that are doing it,

466
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,559
doing amazing things

467
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,600
and had a history of success like yours,

468
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,980
but a lot of people,

469
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,120
that is a barrier for them

470
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,000
that they feel as though

471
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,519
you need to have had

472
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,360
some sort of level of achievement.

473
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Would you recommend it to others,

474
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,000
that idea of actually getting together

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
and curating a group of people

476
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,879
who think differently than you?

477
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,840
And that's what we really are passionate about.

478
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,940
You don't often say,

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,860
you don't need to be Tim Howie,

480
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,340
you don't need to be

481
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,240
the Australian men's water polo coach

482
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,259
and be at the Olympic Games.

483
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,039
You can be yourself.

484
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,340
Is that something you'd recommend to others?

485
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,559
Absolutely, Luke.

486
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,139
I'm not sure that I would have

487
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,139
coached the way I coached at Paris

488
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,200
without those communication with that group.

489
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,480
So that for me is a pretty strong indication

490
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,720
of the importance that's played in my coaching.

491
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,940
And also for not just your coaching,

492
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,279
you know, as a person,

493
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,059
as a father,

494
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,299
as a husband,

495
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,039
as a friend,

496
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,519
as a son,

497
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,000
as a brother.

498
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Yeah, I've found that

499
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,019
you go in thinking

500
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,279
it's just going to help your coaching,

501
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,400
but I feel it's helping me

502
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,079
become hopefully a better person

503
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,720
throughout the process as well.

504
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,839
Yeah, appreciate you sharing that

505
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,700
you know our passion for this idea

506
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,019
of success leaving clues

507
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,960
and that it's very hard

508
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,740
to be able to impact others

509
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,319
unless you understand yourself first.

510
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,420
And I want to ask you

511
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,880
about a really hectic time

512
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,680
over the last three years

513
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,180
appointed Australian men's coach.

514
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,160
How have you been able to fill your cup up

515
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,420
consistently so that you can have

516
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,319
the impact you want on others?

517
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,819
I mentioned before my children.

518
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,619
That's a really nice space for me at the moment.

519
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,140
I love nothing more than taking my daughter Giselle

520
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,160
or my son Raf to their respective sports.

521
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,640
As a coach,

522
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,880
it becomes challenging at times

523
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,859
not to make comment

524
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,099
and I'm very deliberate

525
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,119
to sit a long way away and judge.

526
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,539
I'm not a judgmental person,

527
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,380
but you feel that inside you

528
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,700
as a coach at different times.

529
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,599
So my time with my kids

530
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,720
is really special to me.

531
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,279
I've delved a fair bit

532
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,680
into the yoga, meditation,

533
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,839
journaling type space,

534
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,599
which I think is very, very important for me.

535
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:19,859
I know, again, as a person coach

536
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,539
that if I'm not exercising,

537
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,200
I feel myself out of balance.

538
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,240
You know, I feel my hormonal level shift

539
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,579
and testosterone level

540
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:28,359
is not where they are.

541
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,059
So I spend a lot of time exercising.

542
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,440
But my big vice,

543
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,680
if you're looking for one,

544
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,460
is the ocean and it is the surfing.

545
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,460
I love nothing more than getting into the ocean.

546
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm 45 minutes away from the beaches

547
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,700
here in Sydney, Australia.

548
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,380
A pleasingly urban surf wave pool

549
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,420
has just opened up at home,

550
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,160
which is a 10 minute drive from me.

551
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,559
So I spend a fair bit of time out there

552
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,220
at the moment surfing.

553
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,539
So they will be my pieces.

554
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,960
The other piece that I'm finding really nice

555
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,240
to fill the cup at the moment

556
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
is the grass.

557
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,319
Gratitude space.

558
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,559
I'm going on a journey at the moment

559
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,759
about providing secret gifts to people,

560
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,500
surprise books to their house,

561
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:06,980
recommendations.

562
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,140
I was at a conference,

563
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,700
water polo conference two weeks ago

564
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,500
and there was a young girl

565
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,319
in the session from Tamworth.

566
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,099
And I secretly found out

567
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,019
what her address was

568
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,420
and I've since sent her an Olympic cap

569
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,359
and some Olympic pins.

570
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,440
And she will know,

571
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,680
well, hopefully she'll know

572
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
that that didn't come from me.

573
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,559
I didn't send her a name on the back of it.

574
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,380
And I found that a really nice piece

575
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,920
to do and it's helped fill my cup, absolutely.

576
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,759
Yeah, brilliant answer.

577
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,200
And I love how sophisticated you are

578
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,980
in thinking about all of that.

579
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,279
And that last story is brilliant, isn't it?

580
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,319
It's a genuine goodwill gesture to pass on

581
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,339
knowing that there's nothing in it.

582
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,779
You're not going to receive anything in return.

583
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,819
So it's a great story.

584
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,539
What's one thing that has always worked for you

585
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,559
as a leader that you would never change?

586
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,339
The honesty piece becomes really important for me.

587
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,680
I, truthfully speaking,

588
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,960
didn't love my time.

589
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,660
As an athlete with a national team,

590
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,720
I was lucky enough to play in a world championships.

591
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,220
I didn't make an Olympic Games, you know,

592
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,740
before I missed out in the final squad,

593
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,160
but I made it play to world championships.

594
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,480
But the piece that I hang my hat on most

595
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,740
is around the honesty.

596
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,279
I only had a conversation 15 minutes ago

597
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:11,900
with the player,

598
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:13,960
essentially to say that I don't see them

599
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,319
part of the program moving forward

600
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,559
and here are the reasons why.

601
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,480
And they're not easy conversations to have,

602
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,819
but I find them far easier.

603
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,259
If I'm honest, I know in the future,

604
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,000
if any conversation comes up around that,

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,940
that I've spoken the truth.

606
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,319
So it doesn't make it any easier,

607
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,779
but I believe the whole honesty piece,

608
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,119
particularly with communication,

609
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,799
is vital to me.

610
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,460
Yeah, just remaining really passionate about what I do.

611
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,180
Yes, it's about water polo,

612
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,059
but we've got an opportunity to have an impact

613
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:43,519
on a large number of men and boys' lives.

614
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,180
And that's a big responsibility

615
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,099
that I take a lot of pride in,

616
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,579
but I'm also very passionate about.

617
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,720
I've got to ask the question,

618
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,680
just heard you say you didn't enjoy your time

619
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,900
in the Australian men's program,

620
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,460
despite playing at the highest level

621
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,759
and in the world.

622
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:56,859
Yeah, I think that's a good question.

623
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:56,940
I think that's a good question.

624
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,759
World Championships.

625
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,279
So what was missing for you in terms of enjoyment?

626
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,400
Yeah, it was very much an old school mentality

627
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,700
around you're a basket of eggs.

628
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,700
We will throw all those eggs against the wall.

629
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,680
Those that don't smash will make it.

630
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:14,720
Those that do smash won't make it.

631
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,059
And I was one that got broken.

632
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,940
I was one of those athletes that cracked

633
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
and ultimately didn't make the Olympic Games.

634
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
Even when I think back to that time,

635
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,279
I felt myself wanting to be a coach then.

636
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,880
And I have remembered stories of that time,

637
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,240
which was early 2000s,

638
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,500
about if I ever got this opportunity

639
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,960
to lead a group of people,

640
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,220
business, work, other,

641
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,299
that I would do it differently.

642
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,799
Absolutely good and bad lessons

643
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,119
with all coaches we have.

644
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,539
But I knew that if I had the opportunity,

645
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,299
I would do it differently.

646
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,460
I believe we often make a mistake around enjoyment.

647
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,779
When people see enjoyment,

648
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,279
it's like, well, they're not training hard.

649
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,140
They're not serious.

650
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,119
I don't see it that way.

651
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I see that you can achieve great things

652
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,420
and still enjoy the journey and enjoy the ride.

653
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,759
And I think that my own playing days

654
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,640
have shaped a lot about myself as a coach right now.

655
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,539
And it was hard.

656
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,180
They need to be the fittest team in the world.

657
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,460
So it certainly wasn't easy three years for them.

658
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
And they trained amazingly well, the playing group.

659
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,279
But I do hope that in due course,

660
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,019
they enjoyed the memories and experience

661
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,619
and the moments that they created.

662
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,779
And they enjoyed the time.

663
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,099
They enjoyed the time with the national team.

664
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,339
Yeah, it's been a massive shift, hasn't it,

665
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,839
from the era that you were a player

666
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,200
and the way coaches coached in all sports, really,

667
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,240
as you said, that hierarchy.

668
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,700
And it was a brutal time, really, wasn't it?

669
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,579
And the eggs against the wall smashing,

670
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,420
I can relate to, isn't it?

671
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,279
And there was a body count of those

672
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,799
that didn't get through that

673
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,220
and left feeling pretty dissatisfied.

674
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,440
But I think you're a great example.

675
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,259
I feel like it's spawned a generation of coaches like you

676
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,900
who genuinely feel like there's a better,

677
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:54,740
healthier, smarter.

678
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,619
And effectively,

679
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,339
a more successful way to do it,

680
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,259
which I love hearing you share about.

681
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,519
I know you're really clear on the vision

682
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,279
and the way you've been able to set that vision.

683
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,259
You can hear it in what you've already shared with us.

684
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,279
But can you still,

685
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,839
a story, has there been a visionary leader

686
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,039
that's really inspired you

687
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,460
that in the past you felt compelled

688
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
to follow their vision?

689
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,119
I've been really fortunate in my whole life

690
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,819
to be surrounded by some great leaders and teachers.

691
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,240
I had my year six school reunion yesterday,

692
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,019
1988, I left school.

693
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,640
And I sat next to my,

694
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,900
year six teacher yesterday.

695
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,740
And he was really proud to see

696
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,460
where I'd landed from a national coaching point of view.

697
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,440
But he was my cricket coach and soccer coach

698
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,039
during the late 80s.

699
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:39,839
And I even think about how he used to teach us,

700
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,079
educate us, engage us in the program.

701
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,819
What a great leader he's been.

702
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,380
My mother and father and brother

703
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,680
are three people that I'm very, very close with.

704
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,980
My father unmatched work ethic and discipline.

705
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,559
My mother cared for others

706
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,380
and people first.

707
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,859
You would never see anyone better than her.

708
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,440
My brother, who's had to overcome some real adversity

709
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,380
in the last couple of years,

710
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,400
I've taken some real strong pieces out of them.

711
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,480
My mentor, essentially throughout my whole life,

712
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,220
is a gentleman by the name of Wayne Miranda.

713
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,359
Wayne was a poster boy in Balmain, Sydney, Australia.

714
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,180
I played first grade rugby league,

715
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,500
junior Australian golfer.

716
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,359
And he essentially had it all.

717
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
Sadly, at the moment,

718
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,680
he's got some really poor health,

719
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,599
dealing with some Parkinson's at the moment.

720
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,660
He's not as sharp as he once was.

721
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,259
But I remember back to a grand final

722
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:37,539
when he coached us in 1993 in the under-18s.

723
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,220
And we're in the grand final,

724
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,720
underdog team,

725
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,339
and three-quarter time presents.

726
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,599
And we're a group of 16, 17-year-old,

727
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,880
very impressionable young men.

728
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,619
And we're waiting for his Vince Lombardi speech

729
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,619
at three-quarter time.

730
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,359
You know, some Winston Churchill words of wisdom,

731
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:54,599
which will get us out of here.

732
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:54,619
which will get us out of here.

733
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:54,720
which will get us out of here.

734
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:54,759
which will get us out of here.

735
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:54,799
which will get us out of here.

736
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:54,940
which will get us out of here.

737
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,640
which will get us over the line.

738
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,660
And I'll never forget,

739
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,259
he walked over,

740
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,460
and the 13 of us were looking up to him

741
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,539
with puppy eyes,

742
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,099
just waiting for what we need to do next.

743
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,599
And he left the pause

744
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,819
and said,

745
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,000
boys, if you believe in yourselves

746
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,619
and you believe in each other,

747
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,500
you'll win this game.

748
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,240
And walked off.

749
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,200
And that was it.

750
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,920
You know, sometimes more is more,

751
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:19,779
less is more.

752
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,720
And we went on to win that grand final,

753
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,740
11-7.

754
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,960
And I saw Wayne

755
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
only a couple of weeks ago.

756
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,859
I visited him at his home

757
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,539
and he's getting some care at the moment.

758
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,579
And I wasn't sure how much the Olympics

759
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:33,700
he was able to see

760
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
because of the time difference

761
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,740
and his health.

762
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,799
And I said to him,

763
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,279
oh, Wayne, did you get a chance

764
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,980
to watch the Olympics?

765
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,960
And there was a long pause.

766
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,400
And I was really fearful during that pause

767
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,759
whereby he was about to say that

768
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,099
he didn't know it was on

769
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:47,720
or he missed it

770
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,619
or wasn't able to find the channel, etc.

771
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,819
And he looked at me with his eyes

772
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,119
full of tears and said,

773
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,519
Tim, one of the best things

774
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,400
I've seen in my life.

775
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,160
And I get goosebumps now telling you,

776
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,700
I can feel my eyes getting misty

777
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,799
as we speak.

778
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
But for him, for me,

779
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,180
was well ahead of his time.

780
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,240
I mentioned some bad examples earlier

781
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,420
from a coaching point of view.

782
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,440
But when you talk about

783
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,859
genuine care of players,

784
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,839
yeah, he certainly set the tone

785
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,259
for me how it should be done.

786
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,519
And I've held our relationship

787
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,400
really fondly, fondly ever since.

788
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,480
And yeah, it was really nice

789
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,740
to see that he got to see

790
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,660
the Paris Olympic Games,

791
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,259
which he played a significant role

792
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,079
in terms of developing me

793
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,000
all those years ago.

794
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,720
Amazing impact, isn't it,

795
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,980
that people can have on you

796
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,079
right throughout your lifetime.

797
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,460
And what another beautiful story

798
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,440
about to come full circle

799
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
for him to see you

800
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,079
at the top of your game is incredible.

801
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,059
How do you carve out time to be curious?

802
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,160
We see that a lot,

803
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,380
that idea of curiosity.

804
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,839
And how have you been able

805
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,000
to integrate that into

806
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,579
what you're doing at the moment

807
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:51,619
as the Australian coach

808
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:52,519
of the men's water polo team?

809
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:52,559
Yeah.

810
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,839
The leader piece has been

811
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,660
really big for me, Luke,

812
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,559
as I mentioned before.

813
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,019
And my mum, if you listen to this,

814
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,740
will be really proud of this story.

815
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,480
Growing up, like you, I'm sure, Luke,

816
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,119
I wasn't a reader in terms of

817
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,160
I always wanted to be outside

818
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
and playing whatever I could

819
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,619
from a sport point of view.

820
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,519
And I chose to, didn't find time,

821
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,779
had no interest in reading.

822
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,420
So the joke in my family

823
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,200
is that I went through

824
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
12 years of school

825
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
and didn't read a book.

826
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,759
And I got to a point whereby

827
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,480
I realised that I was missing out.

828
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,759
And so,

829
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,099
as a former athlete,

830
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,440
I set myself a goal.

831
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,240
Who sets themselves a goal with reading?

832
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,099
But so have you.

833
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,839
And the first year,

834
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,299
I set out to read 12 books,

835
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:32,359
one a month.

836
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,039
And I started with very much

837
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,339
the traditional type books,

838
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:36,740
you know, sporting biographies,

839
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:37,500
autobiographies,

840
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,519
and, you know,

841
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:39,839
the Andre Agassi type books.

842
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,579
And I knocked over the year.

843
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,680
I read the 12 books.

844
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,000
And then year two,

845
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,160
I thought, well, you know,

846
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,119
progressive overload.

847
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,259
I need to hit 24.

848
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,539
So I went through, you know,

849
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:51,339
two books a month.

850
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:52,500
And I did that to,

851
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,779
for,

852
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,279
four years back to back.

853
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,400
So I ended up,

854
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,240
maths-wise,

855
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,319
close to 50 books.

856
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,039
So I've found reading

857
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,460
to be a really important piece

858
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,160
for me at the moment.

859
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,440
Pleasingly,

860
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:03,480
mum will be happy

861
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,660
that I've delved out

862
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,420
from your traditional sporting books

863
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,440
and autobiographies.

864
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,039
And I'm now reading

865
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,599
all sorts of different books.

866
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,359
And I've found that my,

867
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
my learning

868
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
has really accelerated

869
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,339
due to that.

870
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,940
I asked myself

871
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,559
why I wasn't curious earlier

872
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,619
in my coaching.

873
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,980
It didn't come from

874
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,900
knowing it all.

875
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,119
I've never been a person

876
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,119
that thinks that I know it all.

877
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,940
I certainly don't now.

878
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,640
I think I've probably got

879
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,859
more or less that I know now

880
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:28,559
than ever before.

881
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,759
But if I had my time again,

882
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,519
I would have gone down

883
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,599
this curiosity piece earlier.

884
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,759
I think it's greatly helped me,

885
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,160
you know,

886
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,319
in all facets of my life.

887
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,500
They say if you read

888
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,640
10 pages a day,

889
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,180
Tim,

890
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,059
you're going to get

891
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,279
close to 36 books a year.

892
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,779
And that sounds so true.

893
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:46,799
I've been trying to set myself

894
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,619
that 10 page a day.

895
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,759
And I'm not there

896
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,619
by any stretch.

897
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,160
But yeah,

898
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,880
I love that you've,

899
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,099
you know,

900
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,740
knocked over two a month

901
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,579
for four years.

902
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,519
It's brilliant.

903
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,460
I've got to ask you,

904
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,000
have you got a book recommendation?

905
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,500
If you had listeners

906
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,740
to pick one out

907
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,420
or two out,

908
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,000
what would you tell them to read?

909
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,400
Yeah, the last one,

910
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:06,039
at the moment,

911
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,119
I'm reading a book called

912
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,740
Unreasonable Hospitality.

913
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,299
I'm not sure whether

914
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:11,200
you've come across that book.

915
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,819
It's about the number one

916
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,259
ranked restaurant in the world.

917
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,200
Really fascinating story.

918
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,099
And essentially,

919
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,359
New York based restaurant.

920
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:18,799
Yes, that's the one.

921
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,480
I haven't read the book,

922
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:20,980
but I've heard

923
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,000
a little bit about it.

924
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,099
Yeah, in simple terms,

925
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,720
their service and their food

926
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,099
and everything

927
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,759
is phenomenal first class.

928
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,380
But one of the themes

929
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:28,779
from the book,

930
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:29,819
how I've picked up anyway,

931
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,079
is that extending the memory.

932
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,259
So when you leave that restaurant

933
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:35,619
and pay the bill,

934
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,980
probably a big one, mind you,

935
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,940
is that you get handed

936
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,259
a bowl of granola.

937
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:41,839
So tomorrow morning

938
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,599
when you wake up,

939
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,859
post your visit to the restaurant,

940
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
you start eating the granola

941
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,799
and then you've extended

942
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,059
your memory from that time

943
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:48,579
in the restaurant.

944
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,480
So again,

945
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,460
like I mentioned before

946
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,099
with the young girl

947
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:52,859
from Tamworth,

948
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,779
and her exposure

949
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:54,579
to the conference,

950
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,940
I tried to extend her memory

951
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,980
by sending her that gift.

952
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,519
I've been really fascinating

953
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,839
by the Johan Harari

954
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,799
Lost Connections book

955
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,539
as a young parent

956
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,640
and the use of phones

957
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,859
and social media.

958
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,380
I found that really powerful for me.

959
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:10,920
I was lucky enough

960
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,019
to have some contact

961
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:12,839
with Bryce Courtney

962
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,960
who worked for my uncle

963
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,559
in advertising for a lot of years.

964
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,079
So I've been lucky enough

965
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:17,720
to read his book,

966
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,779
particularly The Power of One.

967
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:19,460
Batavia,

968
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,119
the Peter Fitzsimons story,

969
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,359
I found a fascinating one.

970
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,359
And I need to put a disclaimer

971
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:24,980
on the next one.

972
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,539
I'm not a drug user.

973
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,380
I never have been.

974
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,599
It's something that's never been

975
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,359
part of my life.

976
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,640
But one of the most fascinating books

977
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,279
that I read

978
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,539
was a book called Marching Powder.

979
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,119
And it was a story

980
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,859
about a young Australian,

981
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,099
Rusty Young,

982
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,359
who travelled to Colombia

983
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,380
and South America.

984
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,180
And in the prison in Bolivia,

985
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,400
the most pure cocaine

986
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,660
was actually produced

987
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,279
in the prison.

988
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
So in the Lonely Planet,

989
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
guides 15 or 20 years ago,

990
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,400
they advertised this prison

991
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,319
as a tourist attraction.

992
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,819
A lot of corruption,

993
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,859
payoff and going in.

994
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:04,920
So yeah,

995
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,500
I've moved on

996
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,420
from the Phil Jackson's

997
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,099
and the Wayne Bennett's

998
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,140
and the Phil Knight stories

999
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,740
and the Kobe Bryant stories

1000
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,579
to reading all sorts

1001
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,279
of different things.

1002
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,819
It's a fascinating story,

1003
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,900
Marching Powder.

1004
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,559
And the unreasonable

1005
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,579
hospitality story

1006
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,740
that I've heard before,

1007
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:19,799
the waiters and the team

1008
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,279
are so well trained there

1009
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,900
to attention to detail.

1010
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,599
And attuned to what's going on

1011
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,259
with their customers.

1012
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,920
And one of the waiters

1013
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,220
had overheard someone say,

1014
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:28,799
God, this has been

1015
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,900
the best meal I've ever had.

1016
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,000
But do you know

1017
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,940
what I really feel like?

1018
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,680
I feel like eating a hot dog.

1019
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,039
And the legend has it

1020
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,960
that the waiter went down

1021
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,420
the street vendor in New York

1022
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,859
because you've got the hot dog stands

1023
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:40,640
on every corner,

1024
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:42,539
purchased a New York hot dog,

1025
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,440
put it into the kitchen.

1026
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:44,519
They served it up

1027
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,240
in sort of five-star

1028
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
fine dining style.

1029
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,240
And, you know,

1030
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,599
talk about unreasonable hospitality.

1031
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,359
The detail of that

1032
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,880
is always fascinating.

1033
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,700
To me,

1034
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,299
we're really interested

1035
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:55,859
in collaboration,

1036
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:56,779
as you know,

1037
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:57,599
through our leader space.

1038
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:58,660
Have you got an example

1039
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,700
of great collaboration

1040
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,119
in your life?

1041
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,279
Yeah, I was only

1042
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,720
thinking the other day.

1043
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,380
My interest in collaborating

1044
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,099
with different people

1045
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:08,779
and different coaches

1046
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,019
is always really, really strong.

1047
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,099
And I'm finding at the moment,

1048
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:14,339
both myself personally

1049
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:14,900
and the team,

1050
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,279
depending on what phase we're at,

1051
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm finding a real interest

1052
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,140
to try and seek out

1053
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,960
certain coaches.

1054
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:21,500
I was lucky enough

1055
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,380
to spend some time

1056
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,279
with Trent Robertson

1057
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,500
at the Sydney Roosters,

1058
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,579
who's also a member

1059
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,700
of the Alida family.

1060
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,359
And the three or four days

1061
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,299
that I spent with he

1062
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,500
and his team

1063
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,279
were incredibly powerful for me.

1064
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,359
And I walked in there

1065
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,819
hoping to take a lot out,

1066
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,819
which I certainly did.

1067
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:42,559
But pleasingly,

1068
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,759
it's also a reminder sometimes

1069
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,900
that actually I might be

1070
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,599
doing some things that are okay.

1071
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,920
So I get the both.

1072
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,859
There's a selfish piece

1073
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:51,720
in terms of, you know,

1074
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,259
post-paralyzing,

1075
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,220
whereas how do you get the group

1076
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,900
back up and running

1077
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,960
after some big disappointment?

1078
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,519
Yeah, thanks for sharing that as well.

1079
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,779
You're a great storyteller

1080
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,200
and you've got a great way

1081
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,839
of communicating.

1082
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,559
Have you had a mantra

1083
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,640
about the way you communicate

1084
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,099
your message?

1085
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,839
Two come to mind

1086
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,099
when I think about communication.

1087
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,200
I only listened to one

1088
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,140
of your recent podcasts

1089
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,359
and it was interesting

1090
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,420
that I've always felt

1091
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,019
that communication

1092
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:16,240
was a strength of mine.

1093
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,299
But I think it's certainly

1094
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,140
a work on for me,

1095
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,599
particularly some

1096
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,299
of the conversations

1097
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:23,720
that we need to take place

1098
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,200
at the moment.

1099
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,019
And often we're finishing

1100
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,359
someone's Olympic dream.

1101
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,140
We're informing them

1102
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,279
of non-selection Olympics

1103
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,319
and that's a 4, 8, 12-year commitment.

1104
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,819
So communication is an area

1105
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:36,660
that I've always felt

1106
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,779
quite comfortable and strong in.

1107
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,599
But I guess I'm starting

1108
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,079
to second-guess that now.

1109
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,019
My son mentioned plays soccer

1110
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:45,900
and I went down

1111
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,099
and watched from a distance,

1112
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,799
not too close.

1113
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,640
I watched from a distance

1114
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,839
and I heard his coach say to him,

1115
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,599
there's a reason you have

1116
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,259
two ears and one mouth.

1117
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,019
And I really love that

1118
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,559
in terms of the voice.

1119
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,039
For me, where I land

1120
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,299
with the communication piece

1121
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,079
is the whole listen to understand,

1122
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,240
not listen to respond.

1123
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,320
I'm getting better at that,

1124
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,980
but I still feel myself

1125
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,480
at different times

1126
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,619
wanting to solve,

1127
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:14,960
wanting to react

1128
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,000
to a certain conversation.

1129
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,059
But I really love

1130
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,679
listen to understand

1131
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,559
and also getting an idea

1132
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,079
of, you know,

1133
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,980
what somebody wants

1134
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,699
out of this communication with me.

1135
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,440
You know, and if it requires

1136
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,179
even asking that,

1137
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,719
you know, what is it

1138
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,099
you're looking for from me in this?

1139
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
Tim, who's been the greatest leader

1140
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,519
in your life?

1141
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,059
Well, fantastic.

1142
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,300
There's been a great deal of them.

1143
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,340
I would go back to Wayne Miranda,

1144
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,699
who I spoke to before.

1145
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,340
I'll go to my father

1146
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,820
and my mother and brother, uncle.

1147
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,820
There would be the people

1148
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,300
that, you know, really spring to mind.

1149
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,679
I'm fortunate enough

1150
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,519
to have a wonderful relationship

1151
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,360
with my wife

1152
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,480
and watching her lead the family unit

1153
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,059
and, you know,

1154
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,820
guide our children

1155
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,039
through a difficult society

1156
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,699
has been inspiring in itself.

1157
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,980
She's a speech pathologist by trade,

1158
00:34:59,159 --> 00:34:59,780
does a lot of work

1159
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,760
with the Indigenous community in Sydney.

1160
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,039
She's exposed to some

1161
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,880
challenging family situations

1162
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,960
and family stories.

1163
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,760
But seeing her navigate

1164
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,500
through all of that,

1165
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,099
the passion,

1166
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,739
the leadership she's shown

1167
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,380
is, you know,

1168
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,539
it's really nice to see

1169
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,119
and be part of

1170
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,480
and hear her stories as well.

1171
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,119
I'd ask you going back

1172
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,900
to Wayne Miranda,

1173
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,380
as you said,

1174
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,840
who's been a lifelong mentor

1175
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,940
and you've played

1176
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,940
in the under-18 premiership with him

1177
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,960
as a young rugby player.

1178
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,519
Was that something

1179
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,480
that you formalised,

1180
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,800
that mentorship along the way

1181
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,159
or was it just born out of a connection

1182
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,880
that you had through growing up?

1183
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,599
Yeah, it was...

1184
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,199
I've spoken to a lot of the players

1185
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,940
who played at that same time

1186
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,500
and sometimes my memories

1187
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,960
and reflections of a certain time

1188
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,900
are different to the other people

1189
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,400
in the group,

1190
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,679
as happens naturally.

1191
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,659
But to a boy

1192
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:52,519
or to a man

1193
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,420
that we all have

1194
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,599
very much the same

1195
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,539
positive thoughts

1196
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:57,039
and memories

1197
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,480
of those couple of years

1198
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,079
under Wayne.

1199
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,820
Wayne,

1200
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,559
it's quite a unique situation

1201
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,920
because he and my father

1202
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
have a relationship

1203
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,239
outside of mine.

1204
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,679
He and my mother

1205
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,559
have a relationship

1206
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,539
outside of mine

1207
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,539
and I personally

1208
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,619
have a really strong connection

1209
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,159
with him.

1210
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:14,900
Wayne and I spent

1211
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,440
a number of years in business

1212
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,260
post-coach-athlete relationship.

1213
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,280
It wasn't a deliberate choice

1214
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,400
for me to ask him,

1215
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:21,639
you know,

1216
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:22,980
will you be my mentor?

1217
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,519
You know, I need your guidance,

1218
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,400
I need your support.

1219
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,179
But he's always been there for me.

1220
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,780
I've always loved

1221
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,820
his ability to listen.

1222
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,079
I've always loved

1223
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,179
his ability to articulate

1224
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:34,280
what I would foresee

1225
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,619
as a really challenging situation

1226
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,199
and put into simple words for me.

1227
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,019
He gave me a

1228
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,980
21st birthday card

1229
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,280
which he spoke at that night

1230
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,559
and I opened up the card

1231
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,719
hoping, wishing, dreaming

1232
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,360
of a long

1233
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,199
couple of paragraphs

1234
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,360
of dialogue

1235
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,599
that he would produce to me.

1236
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,880
And there was

1237
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,460
only a couple of words in there

1238
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,980
and his couple of words

1239
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,579
to me were

1240
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,639
don't change.

1241
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,000
And I've kept that

1242
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,599
21st birthday card

1243
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,340
all my life.

1244
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:04,880
I keep it on my desk

1245
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,900
as a good reminder

1246
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,920
of making sure

1247
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,139
that I stay on track

1248
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:09,860
and stay true

1249
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,820
to what I believe in

1250
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,840
in terms of

1251
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,380
the honesty

1252
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,559
and family values

1253
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,539
and hopefully

1254
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:17,300
a cup-half-full person

1255
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,519
more often than not.

1256
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,019
What a champion.

1257
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,820
Amazing influence

1258
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,460
of you.

1259
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:22,599
He's had on you

1260
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,400
by all the stories

1261
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,019
that you've shared.

1262
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:25,719
If you could collaborate

1263
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,480
with anyone, Tim,

1264
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,739
on anything

1265
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,000
and you've got

1266
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,199
clearly your visions

1267
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,440
and passions for the success

1268
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,500
that you're wanting to achieve,

1269
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:33,139
is there someone

1270
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:33,760
that's really

1271
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,840
been forefront of mind

1272
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,739
you'd love to collaborate with?

1273
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,139
Kenny Atkinson's

1274
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,099
part of the Alita family.

1275
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,340
I'm interested to see he

1276
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,460
in his first couple of days

1277
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,760
literally,

1278
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,840
they've got off to a good start,

1279
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,599
Cleveland Cavaliers,

1280
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,619
of his NBA career.

1281
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,199
But at the moment,

1282
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,800
I'm really loving my time

1283
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,880
with our Alita group

1284
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,980
and at the moment

1285
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,480
that's really

1286
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
fulfilling a lot for me.

1287
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,260
It's been a great pleasure, Tim.

1288
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,679
I've heard so much about you

1289
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,920
and the person that you are

1290
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,119
and to have the opportunity

1291
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:58,760
to sit down

1292
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,860
and learn a lot

1293
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,159
from our conversation today.

1294
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,440
I love your clear thinking

1295
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,119
and your sense of values

1296
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,320
and who you are

1297
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,380
is so strong.

1298
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,900
It's been a real privilege

1299
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,500
for us to be able

1300
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:08,900
to have you

1301
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,920
in the Alita community

1302
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,320
and thanks for joining me today.

1303
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,880
It's been great.

1304
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,739
Thank you for the work you do, Luke,

1305
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,719
and to the Alita family.

1306
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:16,119
I'm sure you get a lot

1307
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,340
of positive comments about it,

1308
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,579
but please be sure

1309
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,059
that it has a huge impact

1310
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,000
on people and coaches.

1311
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,920
So thank you very much.

1312
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,880
Thanks for listening

1313
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,780
