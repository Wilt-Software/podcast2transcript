00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:19,309
I hope you enjoy this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast, powered by temper, a mattress like no other, with Tim Jarvis, an inspirational adventurer who recreated the famous Serena Shackleton adventure in the Antarctic.

2
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:25,170
To hear Tim's pragmatic, optimistic approach to any challenge in life is truly inspirational.

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,609
And he tells the story of writing himself notes before his solo journey to the South Pole that were a preemptive reminder of why he would never give up.

4
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:34,750
A man full of wisdom.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,189
I hope you enjoy this chat as much as I did.

6
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,530
It's people like Tim who inspire the work we do at Alita.

Huge thanks to the team at Temper for supporting the Empowering Leaders podcast, a mattress like no other.

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,650
We spend a third of our life roughly in bed.

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,349
Investing in a temper is something that will seriously change your life.

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,189
I really hope you enjoy this episode.

Tim Jarvis is an explorer, environmental scientist, author and leader.

17
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:39,769
As an adventurer, Tim has taken on some extraordinary challenges, including reenacting two of the harshest and most extreme Antarctic adventures, Douglas Worson and Ernest Shackleton's survival journeys.

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,469
Choosing to do them in the original clothing with the same gear that was used a century ago.

19
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,709
Tim holds master's degrees in environmental science and environmental law.

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,950
Tim's sustainability beliefs, a bit like his approach to expeditions, are based around a pragmatic optimism.

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,950
Tim provides strategic advice.

22
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,409
And practical sustainability advice to a range of corporate organisations.

23
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,210
And in 2016, was voted the Conservationist of the Year by the Australian Geographic Society.

24
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,789
Tim, it's a great pleasure to spend some time with you.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,689
Thank you, Luke. Great to be here.

26
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,349
Tim, your newly released film, Shackleton, The Greatest Story of Survival, it's brilliant.

27
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,349
Thoroughly enjoy it.

28
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,349
I'd encourage everyone to see it, whether you know the story or don't know anything about it.

29
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,030
And for those that aren't so familiar, Tim, with Ernest Shackleton, can you tell us a little bit about him?

30
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,990
And why his leadership has been so important to you?

31
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,289
Yeah, thank you, Luke. And thanks for having me on the show. It's wonderful.

32
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,590
Look, Shackleton was a heroic era explorer.

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,870
So he was around at the same time as Douglas Mawson, which is around essentially the beginning of the 20th century, just before the First World War.

34
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:57,590
And he was an explorer who decided that he would cross Antarctica from one side to the other on his expedition.

35
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:09,229
And by doing that, he would have eclipsed what had already been achieved by Scott and the Norwegian Amundsen, which is to reach the South Pole, which is kind of the middle of the Antarctic, if you like.

36
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,610
So he thought, I will do one better. I'll go all the way across one side to the other via the South Pole in the middle.

37
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,069
And I think it's fair to say the whole expedition went wrong.

38
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,409
The ship he traveled south in called the Endurance was stuck in the ice and then crushed.

39
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,030
It sank, but it left Shackleton and his 27 crew.

40
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,030
Shackleton and his 27 crew stranded initially in the stricken ship for 10 months and then living on the pack ice for a further five months.

41
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:43,430
And then when the ice broke up, having to paddle to the nearest land, which for them was a place called Elephant Island, just off the Antarctic Peninsula.

42
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,050
There he left 22 of the men.

43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:58,030
And he and the five strongest got in one of the expedition rowboats and managed this near suicidal journey across the Southern Ocean from Antarctica to a sub-Antarctic island called South Georgia.

44
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,349
And he and the five strongest got in one of the expedition rowboats and managed this near suicidal journey across the Southern Ocean from Antarctica to a sub-Antarctic island called South Georgia.

45
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:58,669
And he and the five strongest got in one of the expedition rowboats and managed this near suicidal journey across the Southern Ocean from Antarctica to a sub-Antarctic island called South Georgia.

46
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,669
Where he knew there were whaling stations.

47
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:06,569
And this is 1500 Ks across the Southern Ocean, which is rough and, you know, bitterly cold.

48
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,870
And he made it without any modern navigational aids, just using a sextant and a compass with mountains of seas.

49
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,769
Arrived at South Georgia, then had to climb through the mountains of South Georgia to reach the whaling station.

50
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,069
Managed to do that with no equipment and no maps.

51
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,889
Reached the whaling station, raised the alarm and ultimately saved all the men he'd left behind in Antarctica.

52
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,029
So it was just an incredible journey.

53
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:32,910
An incredible journey that took place over about two and a half years by the time you add it all up.

54
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:40,610
And I think the thing that appeals most to me about the leadership, there are so many lessons from it, is the fact that he left no one behind.

55
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:54,829
And he was emotionally intelligent enough to know that to get everybody to pull as one, he needed to, you know, pitch the message slightly differently to the different members of the team to get them to want to pull in the same direction.

56
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,829
Which is really what good leadership, what good leadership is.

57
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:16,410
And I think that message is so relevant to the world today, both the idea of not leaving anyone behind, kind of metaphorically, but also the fact that if you want to make issues like climate change, make inroads into dealing with them, you've got to understand everybody's motivated by slightly different things, not just guilt and fear.

58
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,430
So I think his time has come for his style of leadership.

59
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,990
Yeah, it's a brilliant recreation that you've done.

60
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,449
And I loved it too.

61
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,990
And as I said, I knew of the story, but you certainly took me into areas that I...

62
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,949
I hadn't thought of before.

63
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,850
And I didn't quite understand the genius of Shackleton.

64
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,029
He had an amazing ability to keep his men in high spirits in the toughest of situations.

65
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,069
His men loved him.

66
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,329
And he never asked them to do something that he wasn't prepared to do himself.

67
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,470
And for me, I looked at him and thought, you get this incredible care and empathy that he had.

68
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,269
And, you know, we're really passionate, you know, in these conversations.

69
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,370
I am certainly, Tim, about modern leadership.

70
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,610
And, you know, is it fair to say that maybe Shackleton was 100 years ahead of his time?

71
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:57,649
Yeah.

72
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,129
These are the traits that we see great modern leaders having 100 years later.

73
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,089
I think that's absolutely right.

74
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:10,290
I mean, he perhaps at the time wouldn't have described himself as an emotionally intelligent person

75
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,449
or any of the language we now use, but that's precisely what he was.

76
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,670
I mean, he really had tremendous empathy for his people.

77
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,709
He looked after his people.

78
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:23,529
Like you just said, quite rightly, he never asked people to do stuff he wasn't prepared to do himself.

79
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,170
And these are really unique, unique skills.

80
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:34,949
And, you know, I think he measured his success by how well his team got through the predicaments

81
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:41,930
or the challenges they found themselves in not looking to kind of point score for himself

82
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,790
so that he might be regarded as seen as a good leader.

83
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,149
I think he just looked to get everybody through the circumstances as best he could.

84
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,610
And that, at the end of the day, is another attribute of a good leader.

85
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,850
You know, you're almost kind of invisible to a point and the whole team moves forward.

86
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,750
But when asked what that success is down to,

87
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,870
they all kind of rate the fact that your oversight of the whole thing has been a major factor.

88
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:12,490
I think he was emotionally intelligent because, you know, he was Anglo-Irish.

89
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,970
And at the time, the Irish regarded him as a bit too English

90
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,949
and the English regarded him as a little bit too Irish.

91
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,069
And so he was used to being an outsider.

92
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,990
At a time when Michael Collins was all about, you know, Ireland separating from,

93
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,670
from Britain, there was a, there was a lot of that going on.

94
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:36,870
And so he was used to being clever enough to, to live in both worlds.

95
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,629
He lived in England, but he was, he was Irish.

96
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,930
And he was Merchant Navy rather than Royal Navy.

97
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,329
So he realized that he couldn't just rule with rank.

98
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,110
He had to rule with earning the respect of people as a kind of a Merchant Navy approach.

99
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,670
And he had a lot of women in his life as a young man.

100
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,910
You know, his mother and he had many sisters.

101
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,569
And I think that made him maybe a bit more emotionally intelligent

102
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,610
than the equivalent Edwardian male might've been back then.

103
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,470
And all of that made him a far more empathetic person.

104
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,490
And it is a great survival story and a great leadership story at the same time.

105
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:17,709
A little while ago, you described that boat journey from Elephant Island

106
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:20,670
where he and his men ended up across to South Georgia,

107
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,329
1500 kilometres, 800 nautical miles or thereabouts.

108
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,149
Some of the most treacherous waters on earth.

109
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,449
And to this day, and I think it's regarded maybe as the,

110
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,110
the most dangerous boat crossing that's ever been recorded potentially.

111
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:41,210
You chose to go back and replicate that journey using as close to the same equipment

112
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,230
as you could a hundred years later.

113
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,809
I mean, part of me wants to say why.

114
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:49,269
And the second part is, can you tell us a bit about it?

115
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,610
Well, I'm only 26.

116
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,509
Look what he's done to me.

117
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,809
The stresses of the war.

118
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,509
Look, I mean, first of all,

119
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,049
I really should say it was a team effort and I'm not just saying that to sound like a good guy.

120
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,850
I mean, there were, there were six of us in the boat.

121
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,789
I was the expedition leader, but there was some fantastic sailors and my climbing partner,

122
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:11,549
Baz Gray, who's the regimental sergeant major for Royal Marines in the UK.

123
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,649
A great survival expert.

124
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:18,429
So look, a wonderful, wonderful team effort amongst six people.

125
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,149
But look, I suppose I've always done expeditions because I like to test myself,

126
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:26,049
see what lies within.

127
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,230
You know, we're all interested in finding out a bit more about what life is all about

128
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,169
and our place in it.

129
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,649
And this drives a lot of human endeavour, whether it's sporting prowess or artistic self-expression

130
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:43,529
or looking for extraterrestrial life or entrepreneurialism or medical research.

131
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,769
I think a lot of it is driven by this desire to sort of find out more.

132
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,830
We're naturally inquisitive creatures, humans.

133
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,649
And for me, it just happens to manifest in wanting to push myself at these kind of these sort of

134
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:57,190
limits.

135
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,529
So I suppose it's in it's in my personality that I should want to do this.

136
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,090
In terms of Shackleton, it's the biggest one, biggest one that's out there.

137
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,590
And if you do a lot of expeditions in the modern era, wearing Gore-Tex and using satellite phones

138
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,690
and eating Mars bars, you can't help but think, you know, how would I stack up if I tried to do

139
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:24,250
things old school and would I stack up favourably against those great explorers of old, those men

140
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,929
and women who did these incredible things?

141
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,370
And so.

142
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,809
It's always been of interest.

143
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,450
And then his granddaughter, of course, asked me to do it.

144
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,830
And it was a rhetorical question.

145
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,850
She said, you know, will you?

146
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,990
She really meant you will.

147
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,090
And that was it.

148
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,429
The die was cast.

149
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,889
And Tim, I think a huge part of your passion for doing these adventures in Antarctica is

150
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,629
highlighting the devastating impact of climate change.

151
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,809
And it's very stark in the movie that you've released.

152
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:55,169
The word pragmatic optimist is a word you describe yourself.

153
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,669
You're what needs to be done as a global community to save the environment.

154
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:02,049
How do you describe your sustainability message?

155
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,470
Well, look, I think the sustainability message really is about pragmatic optimism.

156
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:14,090
It's about, you know, telling it like it is and having a plan to do what is required to get us out of the situation.

157
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:17,649
And look, expeditions really are all about that.

158
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:23,090
When Alexandra Shackleton, his granddaughter, asked me to do the trip, I didn't just, you know, build the boat,

159
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,049
get in it and start paddling in the right direction.

160
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,190
I really worked back from the goal I was seeking to achieve, which is, you know,

161
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,629
1,500 Ks, Southern Ocean, wearing cotton smocks, woolens, leather boots, eating lard,

162
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:42,169
navigating with a Sexton, big sea state, potential for some really serious consequences, obviously.

163
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:49,850
And you work back from all of that a lot to give yourself a list of things you need to have in place to give it a good go.

164
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,710
So the right team, the right logistics, enough money, the right risk assessment.

165
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,090
The right boat, the right skills.

166
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,090
And even then, it's very much down to luck as to whether or not you make it.

167
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:06,669
But I always work back from that outcome I seek to achieve.

168
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,730
And I think we need to do the same in the climate situation.

169
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,149
We know the goal we have.

170
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,350
We know it's to not warm the planet by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, worst case 2.

171
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,909
We know what each country needs to do in order to make its contribution towards getting to that 1.5 degrees or no,

172
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:25,629
more than that.

173
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:32,809
And yet when we aggregate all the country's commitments and then below that companies and individuals' commitments within those countries,

174
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:38,389
we find that we're missing that target by, frankly, an order of magnitude.

175
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,669
And so I think we need to tell it like it is, be honest with ourselves and say, look,

176
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:51,470
how do we get back on course to making this carbon budget and the numbers achieve the outcome we seek to reach?

177
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,830
Otherwise, it will be like me getting.

178
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:59,750
In Shackleton's boat and just paddling roughly in the direction of South Georgia with no real hope of making it.

179
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,929
I find that, you know, without being too pessimistic, that's the situation we find ourselves in with the climate piece.

180
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:09,070
You know, we have an aspirational target.

181
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,370
But at the moment, we're not really being honest with what it will take to get us to that that end point.

182
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,309
And we know how to do it.

183
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:23,909
We have all the technology, all the policy mechanisms, if applied at scale, would kind of get us to one and a half Celsius.

184
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,509
It's just a case of getting on with the job.

185
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,950
That is a very pragmatic way to describe it and break it down.

186
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,350
Do you get frustrated?

187
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:44,009
There's loud voices that still question humans' influence in warming and want to have that debate, you know, in a loud way still.

188
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,009
To me, in a simplistic way, we have one planet.

189
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,129
We're all united in the fact that it's a pretty worthwhile goal.

190
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,730
We would think to save it for future generations.

191
00:13:53,909 --> 00:14:02,029
And so it doesn't seem to be too hard a stretch for all of us to want to contribute, you know, burning rainforests down and plastics in the ocean.

192
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:05,549
And that's a separate conversation to the warming conversation you described.

193
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:12,289
But do you still get frustrated by the fact that it's really hard to get unity on something that should unify us all?

194
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,309
Yeah, look, I do.

195
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:23,549
I think I try and take a leaf out of Shackleton's book, which is to say, OK, what is going to be the kind of argument that's going to resonate with this person whose behavior I need to change?

196
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:26,990
And not everyone's influenced by the same thing.

197
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,029
And people have often said to me in the past, luckily, it's not a reality now.

198
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,850
But what would you do if you had a conversation, elevated conversation with Donald Trump, for example?

199
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,870
And I wouldn't have said, you know, how can you do this to the planet for my children on moral grounds?

200
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:51,049
I would have said, look, I've got a great opportunity for you that's going to give you energy security, jobs for America, keep America in the ascendancy economically.

201
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:52,389
And it's called renewable energy.

202
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,730
And there are almost.

203
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:59,870
A billion people working in renewable energy and associated sectors and only 51,000 working in the coal sector.

204
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,950
Which one do you want to back from a purely financial perspective?

205
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,809
And I think that's the kind of argument that would have would have worked with him.

206
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:17,009
I could have imagined him standing on a stage with me potentially and saying, look, I I'm not interested in what Tim says about the moral arguments for climate change, but I am interested in the economics of what he's saying.

207
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:23,309
And that's the sort of the shortest path to getting the outcome you want for an individual like him.

208
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,330
And can I say, I'm pleased it's not the reality that I'll be having a conversation with him.

209
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,990
But I think we need to be kind of clever in the way we package this stuff up.

210
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,690
Yes, I do get I do get frustrated.

211
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:41,649
But again, an expedition lesson is control what you can and don't worry about the rest.

212
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:49,149
And you keep working on the bits that you can control with people who are prepared to work with you and and progress, progress the agendas you can.

213
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,009
And then collectively, we'll make it to muter.

214
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:59,210
You're a passionate leader, passionate about exploring leadership and teaching it.

215
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,629
How do you describe great leadership for you?

216
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,169
Well, I mean, great leadership, if you boil it down, I'm all about really boiling it down into some fairly simple things.

217
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:20,009
I think good, good, great leadership is really about getting a group of people who maybe come from very disparate backgrounds to pull together to achieve a singular outcome.

218
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,070
That's really what it is.

219
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,070
The rest is is the conversation.

220
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,370
Kind of the detail.

221
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,590
You can be a good orator.

222
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,950
You can have the gift of the gab.

223
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,450
You can be very selfless.

224
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,309
You can be very honest.

225
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,129
You can instill trust in people.

226
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:44,870
But ultimately, it really comes down to understanding how you get a group of individuals to pull as one to achieve a singular outcome, understanding that they may all come from different start points.

227
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,129
And when applied to something like climate, I think we've missed a trick here.

228
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,129
I think we tend to still use guilt and fear based messaging.

229
00:16:53,309 --> 00:17:07,369
To try and get change to happen at scale when, in fact, there are many, many more, you know, excuse the kind of the metaphor, you know, shades of green, if you like, that we can use to get people to move forward.

230
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:22,829
Not least of all, if you're talking to a super fund, it's the fact that, you know, things like renewables, blockchain technology, battery technology, electric vehicle technology, hydrogen, they'll all learn their their super fund.

231
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,829
Holders a decent return on their investment.

232
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,809
You don't even have to have a moral discussion.

233
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,450
You just have to want to protect their long term investment, their pension pot.

234
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,009
So I think I think it's about that.

235
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:45,049
It's about really understanding who it is you're leading and leading with with intelligence and emotional intelligence.

236
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,970
Tim, does safe nuclear energy play a role in saving the planet?

237
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,829
Well, look, I'm I'm I'm personally.

238
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:58,910
And these views don't reflect any of the organizations I work with.

239
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,710
They're just my own views.

240
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:07,809
I'm fairly philosophical about using nuclear in certain situations.

241
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,869
I think the conversation or the question for Australia is not whether we should use nuclear.

242
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:24,470
It's whether we should be exporting uranium in such vast quantities if we ourselves are not prepared to entertain the idea of nuclear on our shores or indeed nuclear low level radioactive waste on our shores.

243
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:30,190
So I don't know that it's right to sell uranium and make a large amount of money from it.

244
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:36,890
And they take the moral high ground with something like nuclear and not be prepared to to entertain it on our shores.

245
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:41,630
I don't think you can, you know, have one without the other.

246
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:48,569
You can't just choose to export and, you know, fill your boots and and then decide a moral grounds not to have nuclear yourself.

247
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:54,809
I think that's, you know, it feels like hypocrisy to me.

248
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,130
To do that.

249
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:15,049
Changing gear for a moment, Tim, the mental health crisis that seems to have overwhelmed the Western world, the World Health Organization express a view that by 2030, it will be, you know, one of the greatest, if not the greatest challenges facing humanity at that stage.

250
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,150
You're someone who knows a lot about adversity and dealing with adversity.

251
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,150
How do we teach people to become more resilient and able to cope with adversity?

252
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,829
How do we teach people to become more resilient and able to cope with adversity?

253
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:25,150
How do we teach people to become more resilient and able to cope with adversity?

254
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:33,769
Oh, look, resilience is something that really comes from, you know, there are there are there are many techniques one can use.

255
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:36,490
Personally, I take a leaf out of the expedition book.

256
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:44,650
And as I say, I mean, on our expedition, our Shackleton expedition, for example, any big storm could have wiped us off the face of the place, really.

257
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,349
But you don't worry about that.

258
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,809
You concern yourself with the things that you can control.

259
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:54,809
And I think therein lies the secret to dealing with any of these sort of existential crises.

260
00:19:54,849 --> 00:20:03,930
Where you feel you're just a small player with a limited amount of control over over the direction that the planet or society is taking.

261
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:14,690
I think you need to retreat back into controlling what you can and break down the enormity of the challenge you face with into small pieces and just dealing with those.

262
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,849
Pick a thing and work on that.

263
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,069
And I run a reforestation project.

264
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,509
And it's amazing how, you know, individual individuals come down and plant a few trees.

265
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,630
And get this tremendous sense of calm and satisfaction at having planted 20 trees.

266
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,890
When, of course, the global situation might be such that we've lost a million trees that day or or far more than that.

267
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:48,789
But still, you personally being involved in in doing something about the problem really helps alleviate that sense of helplessness and that sense of that sense of stress or climate anxiety, particularly amongst young people.

268
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,829
Tim, we read Shackleton in his extensive writings.

269
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,690
One of the things he said.

270
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:58,430
There was that loneliness is the penalty of leadership.

271
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:00,349
Do you subscribe to that?

272
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes.

273
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,759
Look, I think I do.

274
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,579
I've done trips that have genuinely been solo endeavors in places like Antarctica.

275
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:17,660
And look, they can be very lonely in their own way, of course, because you're in a vast landscape twice the size of Australia with endless white horizon on your own.

276
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,339
And whatever you can summon up in terms of mental and physical energy is is is the total amount of what you'll achieve.

277
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,900
But I have to say.

278
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:38,299
The level of loneliness one feels when one is in a position of leadership can sometimes or often, in fact, exceed that sense of, you know, loneliness when one is on one's own.

279
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:47,299
And I think it's because you're taking on the responsibility of of decision making at the end of the day.

280
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,579
You know, somebody the buck does ultimately have to stop with somebody on these kind of endeavors and on expeditions.

281
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,299
It's with it's with me where.

282
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm leading it.

283
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:05,859
And, you know, you don't want to show too much in the way of for one of a better description weakness.

284
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,460
You want to show a sense of conviction that you can still achieve.

285
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:17,640
You want to be honest, but you want to also be pragmatically optimistic about about chances.

286
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,799
And, you know, taking a leaf out of Shackleton's book, you know, he had the men playing soccer on the ice when, frankly, they.

287
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,799
Really should have been considering how they were going to survive the rapidly approaching winter.

288
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:41,740
And I think it gave the men the confidence that Shackleton had the measure of the circumstances they found themselves in, because otherwise, why would you be playing soccer and doing language lessons if you didn't expect to make it through the winter?

289
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:51,180
And so as long as people you don't lose people's respect by them feeling you're not you've lost a grasp of the of the gravity of the situation.

290
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,920
I think it can really.

291
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:06,539
Reassure people if you remain calm, at least externally, and doing that sometimes, particularly on board Shackleton's boat, when you're pretty close proximity with people in some pretty hairy situations is not easy.

292
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:18,200
Tim, I'm always interested in the daily habits and routines of people like you have got such a clear sense of self-awareness and grasp and purpose around what you are and what you believe in.

293
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,779
And you go after these these great challenges and want to make a difference in the world.

294
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,400
What is.

295
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,980
That Tim Jarvis do on a daily basis to stay healthy and connected to the person you want to be?

296
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,720
Well, look, I'm very good at compartmentalizing things.

297
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:46,240
I am the proverbial goal oriented person, so I can pick something up, run with it, get it to the point where I feel comfortable that the momentum of that is where I want it to be.

298
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:53,119
Or, you know, some sort of intermediate goal has been achieved towards achieving the bigger picture goal in the long term.

299
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,779
And then I can put that.

300
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,359
I can put that down and go and pick something else up.

301
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:10,759
And I learned, you know, quite a few years ago by listening to people's feedback about how I led that that would would appear as a kind of skill that I have that, you know, enables me to do these things.

302
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,539
So on a given daily basis, I do 10 completely different things.

303
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:18,039
I do policy work in the environment space.

304
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,759
I organize the expeditions.

305
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,799
I work on film projects.

306
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,759
I work trying to motorize.

307
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,700
I motivate large numbers of volunteers in reforestation work.

308
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:31,259
But I'm also, you know, chasing tradies, playing with the kids.

309
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:39,220
I have this capacity, I think, to to put things down and just draw a line under them and think, OK, I'll part that for a while and move on to the next thing.

310
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:53,220
And I think it's a useful skill to have, particularly when you're dealing with these big issues that are far bigger than even the energy that a that a that a, you know, a very focused, driven individual can bring to the table.

311
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:08,480
That ability to be able to be able to put something down and move on and just forget about it for a moment and come back to it and have trust in in in the system and in the framework you put in place is a useful skill.

312
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,440
I'm fascinated in that, Tim, because there's always a school of thought.

313
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,180
People will subscribe to this.

314
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,640
Hey, you can't do too many.

315
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,460
You'll never do any of them.

316
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:23,940
Well, you take on these projects and people who are good at something really zero in on that and that becomes their life skill.

317
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,980
It's the opposite of of who I am as well.

318
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm always jumping from one thing to the next.

319
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,900
And I love it.

320
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,099
I find it really interesting.

321
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,519
And the challenge I find is to do it well.

322
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,460
But in an example in how it works for you, you just find, you know, if you're giving that amount of time to.

323
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,519
To the movie, then that's that time and you can genuinely let that go until the next time comes around.

324
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,000
Is that always been with you or is it something that you've developed?

325
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:54,519
Look, it's something I wasn't really aware of until I saw that other people perhaps didn't didn't operate like that.

326
00:25:54,579 --> 00:26:00,000
And I thought, well, maybe this is something that I wouldn't say is unique to me.

327
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,460
But for people who achieve things like the kind of things I'm doing, they're like project management exercises and they require different skill sets applied.

328
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:19,779
At different times to get things over the line, and I'd say in any major endeavor in life, you need a few different skills and you've got to bring them to bear at different moments.

329
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,579
I mean, you've got to have obviously a little bit of small P political now.

330
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:33,279
So you've got to understand how to work with people and be emotionally intelligent to work with different people that are driven by different things of different different set value sets.

331
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,380
For example, you've got to have a bit of technical understanding of the.

332
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:51,440
The area that you're seeking to try and work in helps if you have a particular area, even if even if it's not something which is across the whole field of endeavor, but have one niche area of skill that you can kind of fall back on.

333
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,779
You've got to have the resilience to see something through.

334
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:07,039
And I meet a lot of great people who have all the attributes, but perhaps not the the endurance of the resilience to see something through.

335
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,460
And I often say to them, you know, you just.

336
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,980
Keep going and you will ultimately be successful, but it does take it does take that that sense of resilience to do it.

337
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:25,980
And you need not only an understanding of the kind of the way the world works and a technical ability, but also a sense of idealism.

338
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,019
And I find, you know, again, this is a sweeping generalization with young people.

339
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,440
I see a tremendous amount of idealism for some of the older ones.

340
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,279
Sometimes that idealism is being blunted.

341
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,740
By by the world.

342
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:54,920
And I would urge them to never lose sight of that, because really, as you get into those advanced years, particularly in a business context, you know, you've got such a wealth of knowledge that if you could bring that to bear and just keep the faith.

343
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,140
It's amazing what what what change you could make happen.

344
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,119
So it's retaining that sense of idealism as well.

345
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,740
Yeah, it's a great message, Tim.

346
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,259
And I love that story, isn't it?

347
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,299
The skills and capability.

348
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,460
But that grit.

349
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:14,740
And that capacity to push through and not, you know, wilter at any stage, I suppose, isn't it?

350
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,960
There's hurdles all the time.

351
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,960
And people who have that sense of determination are the ones.

352
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,680
I think it's how you react to problems, you know, to quote in management speak, they talk about failing forward, don't they?

353
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,599
And failure is feedback.

354
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:38,059
And I think, you know, you've really got to learn to enjoy problems coming up because they represent yet another opportunity for you to either prove yourself to yourself or to others.

355
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
And also to learn and grow as a person.

356
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,900
And I quite enjoy a problem.

357
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:50,880
There may be a few a few bits of interesting language when when when a problem, you know, presents itself.

358
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,299
But immediately I click into thinking, OK, how are we going to overcome this?

359
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,460
And in so doing, what am I going to learn from that?

360
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:00,559
And it becomes quite addictive.

361
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:08,299
You know, on South Georgia, when we did the mountain crossing after the boat journey, retracing Shackleton.

362
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,099
And three of my guys ended up in very poor physical shape and couldn't do the mountain crossing.

363
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:24,420
And that left myself, Baz and Paul Larson, who were kind of the expedition leader, hard man and navigator respectively, to do the crossing.

364
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,579
And we could easily have looked at one another and thought, you know, how unlucky are we?

365
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,619
All of our safety net is gone in doing it as a team of six.

366
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,299
But instead, we thought, hold on a second.

367
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
Shackleton lost three men on his journey to injury.

368
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,880
I mean, they they were they were they were alive, but they were unable to do the mountain crossing.

369
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,160
And he did it as the expedition leader with Tom Crean, the hard man and Frank Worsley, the navigator.

370
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,599
So we're doing it as exactly the same three as he had done.

371
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,099
And that brings us closer to what he experienced, even though it's a hell of a lot more dangerous.

372
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,920
Isn't that great? And we sort of dined out on that one.

373
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,940
So you're always kind of trying to look for positives in any situation.

374
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,579
Yeah, what a sense of destiny in that, isn't it?

375
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,039
I mean, that story for Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter to ask you to do it and then for it to play it like that.

376
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,579
It's, you know, it's a universal piece of energy at play there for sure.

377
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,539
You do a lot of work with different corporations.

378
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm fascinated in Patagonia.

379
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:36,740
What a remarkable company and an amazing story in recent times to the founder effectively donating that incredible business to the sustainability of the planet.

380
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,980
Can you tell me a bit about your work?

381
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,759
Can you tell me a bit about your work advising Patagonia on their sustainability?

382
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,119
Yes, well, look, I mean, I've had a very good working relationship and friendship with Dana Shanasey, who's a very inspiring guy.

383
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,660
He's the CEO of Patagonia here in Australia.

384
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:07,220
And essentially, I have been working for about five years now on trying to get an East Antarctic marine protected area set up down in the Antarctic.

385
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:07,920
Be about a million.

386
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,559
Square kilometers of ocean protected in perpetuity.

387
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:21,779
And that million square kilometers is the bit of ocean essentially opposite Australia's land base holding in Antarctica, because we actually have 42 percent of Antarctic.

388
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,619
Antarctica is Australian Antarctic territory.

389
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:31,900
So I've been working on that for about five years with an organization in the U.S. called Pew, who've got representation here in Australia.

390
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:37,819
And at the same time, Patagonia have been working for a long time.

391
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,640
In marine protection, in funding films about marine protection, in supporting charities and NGOs that do work in that space.

392
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:59,319
And most recently, I've been working with them on on adding value to their whole marine protection program, which is already pretty well advanced.

393
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,319
And they're a very inspiring company.

394
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:07,319
I think Yvonne Schoonard, who's the owner of Patagonia, is a climber from yesteryear.

395
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Yeah, he's in his advanced years now.

396
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,000
But what a legend of a guy.

397
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:27,200
And he decided that, you know, they were going to donate all the profits of the of the company to to climate change, to fighting climate change, which is just, you know, amazing, amazing thing to do.

398
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
So, look, I'm very inspired in working with them.

399
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,359
But marine protection is is is the way I'm working with them at the moment.

400
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,440
They do so much more.

401
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,980
Yeah, wonderful.

402
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,740
From the very start, they had that vision and have lived those values, haven't they?

403
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:45,740
And shown the way for so many other companies.

404
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:54,480
The original B Corp, if you if you like, and I'm not surprised that that is the legacy that that organization will have.

405
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,619
Tim, I've loved sitting across from different leaders and different backgrounds and your leadership stories is so unique and so much wisdom in it.

406
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,619
And we feel like there are some some pretty consistent dimensions of what great leadership looks like.

407
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,240
And I'm keen to talk to you about starting with self-leadership.

408
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:15,539
Tim, we don't think you can really lead unless you've got a sense of what self-leadership means to you.

409
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,500
When I when I ask you about that, how do you think of self-leadership?

410
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,059
Well, I think about my own motivations.

411
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:28,440
I think about being true to myself and what my moral compass looks like.

412
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,759
But I also have a sense of humility.

413
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:32,960
It's interesting.

414
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,559
I was having a very interesting conversation the other day with some sports psychologists, and they were talking about the difference.

415
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:50,420
Between the psychology of leadership in a team sport context where you're up against human opposition and leadership in the context of, say, the mountains or Antarctica or the ocean.

416
00:33:50,819 --> 00:34:03,880
And at the end of the day, the difference is that one involves, I suppose, working up against human opposition, whereas in the outdoors, it's just you and what you can bring.

417
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,420
And nature is the thing you're not up against.

418
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,340
But you're working with, I suppose.

419
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,980
And that brings about a real sense of humility.

420
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,699
You don't take seriously the things you've achieved before.

421
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,599
Your CV of previous accomplishments doesn't mean anything to nature.

422
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,699
So I bring that humility to each situation I find myself in.

423
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,920
Don't take myself very seriously.

424
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,019
Take what I do seriously when I'm there.

425
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,199
I think that's a very important, very important aspect to it all.

426
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,199
And I understand my own limitations.

427
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:47,099
And weaknesses enough to sort of recruit the right people to help fill those gaps and make up shortfalls in that area.

428
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:59,619
And I think being honest with yourself and honest with others about your weaknesses also engenders a sense of sort of trust and respect amongst your team.

429
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,619
But a common theme, you know, and also in the movie you just released, Shackleton was very particular.

430
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,420
Recruiting the men that were on that expedition and probably the reason why they all survived in the end, wasn't it?

431
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:18,519
He had a very, from the story you tell, a strict criteria about problem solvers and positive energy.

432
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:26,179
I was lucky enough in this podcast recently to talk to Matt Fleur, the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who's doing an amazing job in a sporting context.

433
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:37,599
But, you know, 23 coaching staff and he spoke about that jigsaw and every person being so important to complement the skills that he had enough humility to realise he didn't have the answers on everything.

434
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:38,980
An incredibly humble guy.

435
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,500
It's a common theme.

436
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,880
I'm not surprised to hear your thoughts on that too around self-leadership.

437
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:52,000
We see leaders, Tim, are very conscious around, on a daily basis, how they impact other people positively in the environments that they are in.

438
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,539
How do you go about doing that on a daily basis, impacting other people positively?

439
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:05,019
Well, I think, you know, the goal is, the role of leader really is to bring out the best in people.

440
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,519
And, you know, this takes a certain amount.

441
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,500
The maturity to really come to terms with.

442
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,420
I'll give you an example.

443
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:21,760
With the Shackleton expedition, when we finished, we had made a film on that original expedition with a little camera that was on our boat that filmed everything that happened.

444
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,119
And when it all finished, we had some exit interviews conducted by Discovery Channel.

445
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,260
And they interviewed me and they interviewed the five other guys in the team.

446
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:36,739
And each one of them, in their exit interview, which was an hour long, conducted immediately that we'd finished.

447
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,599
He was still a beard.

448
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,360
And probably hadn't showered and things like that.

449
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,059
And were in our old clothes and really looked the part.

450
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:50,980
And each one of them basically said that they felt they had been the reason why the whole endeavor had been so successful.

451
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:58,239
You know, they did it modestly, but they were confident in their own minds that, you know, they were the kind of key thing.

452
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,119
Bass said he felt that the way that the climbing was conducted in the mountains, really under his, ultimately his leadership for that particular component,

453
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:07,599
was, you know, it was a lot of work.

454
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,739
That was why we got through it.

455
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:15,559
You know, the sailors said, well, if I haven't navigated so well and got the boat through those storms we found ourselves in, I suspect we may not have made it.

456
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:22,480
The guy who built the boat said, well, if it hadn't been for me doing such a good job on the construction of the boat, I don't think it would have remained afloat.

457
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:30,860
And the guy who filmed it all and was also a climber said, well, if I hadn't been there for the climbing and also to film this, we wouldn't have had the funding to make this in the first place.

458
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,159
Long story short, everybody felt that they were instrumental in the whole expedition being.

459
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,360
Such a success.

460
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,280
And I remember listening to this and actually at the time being a little bit challenged by this, thinking, how can they say that?

461
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,539
You know, I was the leader of that and I pulled it together.

462
00:37:48,539 --> 00:38:01,039
But then I thought for a moment that maybe a good reflection on how good your leadership is, is how each individual feels that they were able to bring their A game, that they were the deciding factor.

463
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:05,820
And, you know, maybe that is a better reflection on good leadership.

464
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,539
The fact that your people all feel valued.

465
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,780
Valued and feel that they could, you know, bring the best they had to give.

466
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,699
And your role is to enable them to do that.

467
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,380
And so I've kind of revisited that history.

468
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,940
I now feel very happy about that.

469
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,519
I regard that as a great success that each person felt so empowered by the whole thing.

470
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:27,000
And you use that word empowered at the end, Tim.

471
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,940
It's the title of this podcast, Empowering Leadership and Empowering Leaders.

472
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,400
Because exactly as you said, you know, that expedition was a success.

473
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,940
You empowered those guys subconsciously.

474
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,519
Consciously, all consciously to do their job so well that they realised how important they were.

475
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,820
It's exactly, you know, what we see consistently.

476
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,920
It's a great story.

477
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,699
Thanks for sharing that.

478
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
Creating and sharing a vision.

479
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:52,619
We see leaders are really conscious about how they go about that.

480
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,179
You've had some really clear visions that you've taken on and accomplished.

481
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,260
How have you gone about that?

482
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,099
Well, I think it's very important to set that all out in advance.

483
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:03,880
I mean, it's interesting.

484
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,679
I use the vision mission.

485
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,699
And the distinction between those two actually to talk both to Shackleton's story,

486
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,500
but also to climate as an issue.

487
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:19,260
I mean, with Shackleton's journey, of course, you know,

488
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,800
their vision had been to do something at the limits of human endurance,

489
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,039
pushing new boundaries, returning as heroes,

490
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,360
whatever their vision might have been in their own minds.

491
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,159
Their mission was to cross Antarctica in order to achieve that.

492
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,719
Now, with the loss of the ship,

493
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,219
the mission evidently changed.

494
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,139
They weren't going to cross Antarctica anymore.

495
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,400
Shackleton gathered everybody around and said,

496
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,380
look, this isn't going to happen.

497
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,519
The new mission is saving ourselves.

498
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,900
The good news is we're still going to achieve the vision.

499
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,119
It's just that the mission has changed.

500
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,079
And I use that kind of metaphor to talk to, say, for example,

501
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:02,300
a company involved in fossil fuel energy production and say,

502
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,519
look, you know, your vision might be to provide energy to businesses,

503
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,119
and people to enable them to achieve their life goals whatever it might be or their business

504
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,280
objectives none of that needs to change it's just the mission has to change the way you go about

505
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,659
doing this has to change you don't have to abandon the dna of the organization you just have to do

506
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:27,239
things differently and i think most people can can understand and that's a good definition by

507
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:32,099
the word purposeful leadership really is remain remembering what the why is and not being so

508
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:37,840
focused on the how and the what because if you remain focused on them it really limits your

509
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,780
ability to change as an organization you're just limited to how you've always done things

510
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:50,099
rather than remembering why it is you're actually doing them another great piece of advice we see

511
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:56,340
the word curiosity as a consistent approach for leaders who then take that into their learning

512
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:02,079
and develop their constant learning how does curiosity show up for you tim well i'm always

513
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,539
looking to learn um i approach each thing as if it's a new thing as i was saying before you know

514
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:15,980
i don't i don't take uh my list of previous achievements very seriously i i uh when you

515
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:22,059
spend enough time in the outdoors nature really ultimately doesn't care whether you're a nice guy

516
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:25,239
whether you're a parent whether you're doing something for charity you're just someone who's

517
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:32,059
chosen to try and do something in a particular space and if you're good enough and

518
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,260
luck goes your way and you have the right people behind you and they're motivated you may prevail

519
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:43,820
otherwise you may not and um you know i approach each thing in in in the same way i'm curious to

520
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:51,300
learn new things constantly grow as a person and accept my shortfalls and and retain that

521
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:58,320
sense of humility because i know that ultimately um you know it won't count for anything not in

522
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,059
not in not in the world in which i operate well assuming communication

523
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,920
with clarity is a pretty important tool for you and we see that with other leaders as well

524
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,599
particularly in the environments that you've taken and led teams in how have you gone about

525
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:20,480
communicating with clarity well i mean i think it's about uh you know a simple set of instructions

526
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,159
that suit the circumstances that you're uh you're in sometimes i find it's useful to actually remind

527
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,960
people why they said they wanted to do something um

528
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,780
it helps them to be able to do something and it helps them to be able to do something

529
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,099
helps, you know, retain a sense of purpose and helps get people through the circumstances they

530
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,860
find themselves in. If you remind them why it was they said they wanted to do this in the first

531
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:49,900
place. And in fact, on the expeditions I do where I'm solo, I write down the reasons why it was I

532
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,719
said I wanted to do this in the first place. And I know myself well enough to know my own sort of

533
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:00,179
strengths and weaknesses. And I almost have responses written down to help me have that

534
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:03,599
internal conversation when I come up against something that I know is going to be challenging

535
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:12,260
for me. So I suppose I would sit people down and urge them to remember the why we're doing this.

536
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:18,059
And it helps to reframe things and refocus them rather than just bark orders at people

537
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:24,900
when they're in a state of duress. It's another great, you know, piece of wisdom and reflection,

538
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,460
isn't it? We get lost sometimes, don't we, in the doing and you forget originally why you started

539
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,260
out to do something, whether it's a business. I remembered it from many of the expeditions.

540
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,760
Well, you know, you're sitting in a press conference before you go and it's easy to

541
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,579
sound heroic and, you know, we're going to do this and we're going to conquer that. And

542
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,679
I've trained hard and, you know, we've got a high caliber team. And then you get down there

543
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:49,539
and it's miserable and confronting and challenging. And you've had a disagreement

544
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:54,739
with someone on the team. And the fabric of the whole thing feels like it could easily

545
00:43:54,739 --> 00:44:02,179
fall to pieces. And it's important then to just take a step back and remind yourself of why

546
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,579
and have that conversation. And I think that's really important. And I think that's really

547
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:03,599
important. And I think that's really important. And I think that's really important. And I think

548
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,260
have some advice for yourself that you may have written down in advance of going that

549
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:13,860
helps you kind of get through those circumstances. I think it's accurate. And again, I can only

550
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,980
imagine some of the thoughts that must have crossed his mind at various stages. Look,

551
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,659
on a number of occasions, as if they were doomed and there was no hope, but clearly,

552
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:27,119
he found a way and found his way through. And one of the great stories, we see leaders are

553
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,619
really conscious of collaboration now, Tim, and how important that is to leaders. It sounds like

554
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:37,440
that's an enormous part of your world. How important is collaboration? Well, I mean, you know,

555
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,699
you're collaborating all the way through a process of planning something like this, for example. I

556
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:48,179
mean, it was a five-year process of making that expedition a reality. And I think the key thing

557
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:54,079
is to go into it all, accepting that there are many things you don't know. Again, it comes back

558
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,860
to this humility piece and this being honest with yourself and with others and going into it and

559
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,380
asking even...

560
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:07,380
the you know the silliest questions because at the end of the day you're going to need answers to

561
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,079
to many of those many of those questions and you know you build resilience in people through

562
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,059
going through a really exhaustive risk assessment of all the things you feel

563
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:22,239
can or might go wrong and you need to have answers for how you're going to react in all of those

564
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,639
situations there's no point getting down in the southern ocean in a keel-less rowboat wearing a

565
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:32,800
cotton smock when a wave just knocked the boat upside down and then go oh right okay we hadn't

566
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,500
thought of this this scenario so it's very important to discuss all that before you go i

567
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:46,300
would say i would say honesty uh honesty builds trust and having frank conversations about the

568
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,559
kinds of conditions you're likely to face and you know having an almost childlike ability to keep

569
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,619
asking questions some of the most challenging talks i do are to a young audience

570
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,139
is where kids will always go why and you'll give an explanation and they'll say yeah but why

571
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:06,519
and you say well look i mean you know the reality is you know they go yeah but why

572
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:12,159
and at the end of it all you often find yourself saying i don't know kid you've that's a good

573
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,559
question and um so i think we should never lose that sort of childlike ability to keep on asking

574
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,239
asking the obvious questions tim who's been the greatest leader in your life

575
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:29,090
well you know that's difficult um in all honesty

576
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:36,329
i don't think i can name uh one person i think i'm i'm someone who's kind of

577
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,929
taken bits of advice from different people i've seen

578
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:45,449
uh over the years and i've had contact with over the years of course shackleton is a

579
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:51,469
significant player in my life because i've got inside his head and seen perhaps some of the

580
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:56,789
things that he saw being some of the situations he's been in i think my father has always been

581
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:59,289
someone who um was a very good player and i think he's been a very good player and i think he's been

582
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:04,369
or continues to be a very modest guy he's achieved a lot with his life he's a working

583
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:10,610
class guy from north london who's achieved great things uh he approaches everything with a sense

584
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:15,730
of humility and honesty and modesty and that's a great example the only thing i'd say is that

585
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,550
he perhaps never gives himself due credit for the things he's managed to achieve he i think

586
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,449
in in any situation in life you should you know be prepared to give yourself a pat on the back

587
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:29,289
if you've done something that's worthy of merit you don't have to wear a mask you don't have to

588
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:35,929
wear it on your sleeve and show off about it but i think you know um having that private sense of

589
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:40,730
accomplishment and confidence that you've derived you can derive from having achieved something

590
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,349
is something you should carry with you you don't need to shout it from the rooftops

591
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:51,429
but i i find a lot of individuals have inspired me over the years individual acts of selflessness

592
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:57,670
that's what inspires me not one individual necessarily yeah i love the answer it's always

593
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,289
fascinating um to hear that response and i think it's a great answer and i think it's a great

594
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:03,929
response and and those that have been lucky enough to have a close family member influential

595
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:09,730
in their life it's um it's a place to go straight away and i and clearly you're uh you know have

596
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,889
tracked the history of shackled and you know very closely and i love your point too around

597
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:17,369
you know celebrating those little moments where traditionally you know growing up in north london

598
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,750
or even australia never never really been great at that but it is an important thing to do is as

599
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,989
you see you don't have to you know i think it is i think you need those two parallel tracks you've

600
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,989
got the outwardly facing being

601
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:35,710
humble that's that's my modus operandi um but internally you do have to have some serious

602
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,530
conversations with yourself about whether you're going to really cut yourself some slack and

603
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:47,929
i'm my own worst critic but when you walk to south pole as i did in 1999 um very evidently

604
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:54,909
you've achieved something significant you know um you do have to have that private conversation

605
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:59,289
and say look i know the temptation this internal voice is the temptation is to have a conversation

606
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:04,889
for the fact that you've achieved this for it to somehow demean it but you've got to have that

607
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,929
private conversation and say come on you've got to be serious here that this is something

608
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:12,630
from which i must learn and give myself some credit i don't have to again shout it from the

609
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:18,369
rooftops but i do have to uh i do have to accept i've achieved something here tim final question

610
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:22,329
for me we're obsessed with this world of collaboration and some of the work we do

611
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:27,329
bringing together different leaders from different backgrounds into collaborative forums tim is part

612
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:29,289
of a huge passion for for me at the moment and i think it's a really important thing to do and i

613
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:34,110
love your diverse background as you mentioned before leaders from the arts or sport or

614
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:40,989
entrepreneurial endeavors uh bring a different line of thinking and we we love that uh cross

615
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:46,570
pollination and male and female leaders and the diversity of it uh is something we see a great

616
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,650
that loneliness and leadership bringing people together is a great passion for us and in that

617
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,190
spirit of collaboration if if you could collaborate with anyone on anything tim you've you you

618
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:59,289
articulated really fascinating to me just how adept you are at the

619
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:03,969
different things in your life and compartmentalizing but has there been one person you might think of

620
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:08,429
i'd love to do an expedition or another part of your life or collaborate with anyone that springs

621
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:12,969
to mind well i'm gonna i'm afraid i'm gonna come out with some fairly stereotypical stuff here but

622
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:18,269
i've been very lucky to work a bit with sir david attenborough i am uh vice president which is an

623
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:24,150
honorary role of his charity ffi fauna and flora international and obviously he's an inspiring

624
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,289
figure i i feel like um you know people like him we need to be able to do a lot of things together

625
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:35,409
we need to uh learn from and take on board all the information we can and all the wisdom we can

626
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:41,929
before um before they're gone you know and i think in the environment space we have people like jane

627
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:49,650
goodall um sir david uh sylvia earl who's the sort of grand old lady if i can put it that way

628
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:55,070
of sort of ocean health for the american uh scientists and they they're not going to be

629
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,809
here forever and i think it's important for us to

630
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,670
with them and get as much as we can in terms of wisdom from them before

631
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:12,170
we don't have them to uh provide us with guidance going forward so i'm uh i intend personally to

632
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:17,630
continue to work with sir david and try and uh spend as much time working with ffi as i can

633
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:24,909
uh before he steps away from it tim and i love um the pragmatic optimism uh you know a combination

634
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:28,769
of words i hadn't thought of uh before but i hear it in all your words and

635
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:35,170
shaming people into into doing things doesn't seem like a path that's been successful but

636
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,670
trying to as you said lead in the uh the great history of shackleton and what he was able to do

637
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:45,570
it's the it is the great story of survival as you called it the movie is fantastic i uh i loved

638
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:50,030
watching it uh learned so much again from you know the wisdom of it and the leadership of it

639
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:54,730
it is out now uh look it up shackleton the greatest story of survival and tim jarvis

640
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:59,030
i've been uh thoroughly enjoyed spending some time with you so much to

641
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:03,030
learn from the way you approach life i really appreciate you joining me today thanks luke and

642
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,130
as shackleton said you know problems are just things to overcome after all and i think um

643
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:12,829
you know it's that kind of attitude to uh to things that we need to take from him thank you
