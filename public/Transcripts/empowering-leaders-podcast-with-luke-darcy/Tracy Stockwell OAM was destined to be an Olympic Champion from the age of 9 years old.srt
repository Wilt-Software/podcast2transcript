00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,769
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Tracey Stockwell,

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,189
who under her maiden name, Tracey Calkins,

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,529
became one of the most successful athletes in American Olympic history.

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,550
You'll hear Tracey talk about the extraordinary advice her coach gave her

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,929
15 minutes before winning her first ever Olympic gold medal,

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,429
the beautiful perspective Tracey offers on the challenge of not being re-elected

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,890
as president of Swimming Australia.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,609
You'll also hear her great passion for growing women's sport in Australia

9
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,909
and the remarkable contribution that she made in that space.

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,070
I loved her discussion about the relationship that she has with her husband,

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,869
Australian swimming legend Mark Stockwell,

12
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,630
and you hear about the legendary Stockwell family Sunday night dinners.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,409
It's a beautiful story, a great chat that I love recording with Tracey,

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,450
and I'm sure you're going to enjoy it as much as I did.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,030
It's legendary and iconic people like Tracey Stockwell

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,509
who inspire the work we do at Alita Collective.

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,009
In particular, I'd love you to have a look at our signature bespoke program,

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,650
Alita Connect, where we join and connect great leaders from around the globe,

19
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,569
incredible people like Tracey, in bespoke, facilitated five- or six-person groups.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,849
It's a program that we call Alita Connect,

21
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,290
and you don't have to be an Olympic legend like Tracey Stockwell

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,329
to be part of Alita Connect.

23
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,590
We love the educators.

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,370
We love bringing people from the arts and from social venture,

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,670
from industry and from sport together.

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,349
And that diversity of thinking we genuinely feel

27
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,510
is a great asset to have in your life

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,030
and to have a team of people who are walking alongside you

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,469
to support your thinking but also challenge your thinking

30
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,290
is a really valuable thing.

31
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,189
That's Alita Connect.

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,030
You can check it out.

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,650
Head to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call,

34
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,549
and my great friend Matt Wadowitz or I will get back to you

35
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,790
and discuss you participating in something we're really passionate about

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,790
called Alita Connect.

37
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,769
Huge thanks, as always, to the team at Tempa,

38
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,250
Jason Nicholas and his team, Tempa Australia New Zealand,

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,250
incredible supporters of bringing conversations like this one,

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,849
with Tracey Stockwell to the table on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

41
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,670
We know great leaders understand the importance of sleep.

42
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,250
This is NASA approved.

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,150
The best bedding in the world is Tempa.

44
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,949
And so when you think about spending a third of your life asleep,

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,849
to invest in a mattress that is going to support better sleep

46
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,750
is a great decision to take.

47
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,250
Could not recommend it more highly.

48
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:20,189
Been fortunate enough to be sleeping on Tempa bedding

49
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,629
for the past 15 years.

50
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,870
It's a life-changing decision.

51
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,810
Thanks to Tempa and the team, a mattress like no other.

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,479
Tracey Stockwell, Niamh Calkins is one of the most successful athletes

53
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,659
in US sporting history.

54
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,479
She won three gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles,

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,939
having been favourite four years earlier to win potentially a further seven gold

56
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,020
in Moscow before the US boycotted the Games in protest

57
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,180
over Russia's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

58
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,919
Her five world records, 63 US records, 48 national titles,

59
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,860
12 individual NCAA titles are a record for a US female swimmer.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,620
Tracey married Australian swimming legend Mark Stockwell.

61
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,379
They have five children and Tracey is one of the most respected

62
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,860
sporting administrators in Australia.

63
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,280
Tracey, it's quite the CV.

64
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,560
Great to catch up with you.

65
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,939
Well, thank you for that little trip down memory lane there.

66
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,280
It's kind of like, did I do that?

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,599
Well, I hope I was accurate.

68
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,599
Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,639
It's quite extraordinary.

70
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,319
And I read with interest that nine years of age,

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,099
and tell me if I'm wrong, you're sitting at home,

72
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,759
you're watching the 1972 Munich Olympic Games.

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,639
And did you say that?

74
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,259
Then I want to be an Olympian.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,620
Is that true?

76
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,080
I did.

77
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:31,479
I did.

78
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,439
I had only been swimming for about a year,

79
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,319
just at a little local swimming club with my older brother and sister

80
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,240
encouraging me to take part.

81
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,439
And I remember watching, we love sport and our family always watched

82
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,719
the Olympics on TV and remember watching Mark Spitz win seven gold medals,

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,639
but also Shane Gould with her green and gold terry toweling robe

84
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,860
and her little koala, or maybe it was a kangaroo, you know,

85
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,939
and that really, I thought,

86
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:58,960
well, that's a good thing.

87
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,280
Wow.

88
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,080
You know, I didn't know how you got to the Olympics,

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,379
but I did say to my mom and dad, that's what I want to do.

90
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,460
Do you think I could go to the Olympics one day?

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,860
It must be straight sitting here now referencing Shane Gould

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,080
and how your life's been so much in Australia.

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,660
Do you ever stop back and think, oh, growing up in Nashville, Tennessee,

94
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,360
it's a long way, isn't it, to where you are now?

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:19,860
It is.

96
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,160
But my very first trip overseas on a small US team was to Australia.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,699
And I was 13 when I left, 14 when I came back.

98
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,379
And my mother always says, I sent away a little girl

99
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,240
and a young woman came back.

100
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,620
And we went to Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart

101
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,620
to compete and do some exhibition swimming.

102
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,300
And first time I had swum in a saltwater pool at North Sydney

103
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,660
and swam in the old 1956 Olympic pool here in Melbourne,

104
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,040
which, you know, that tells you how old I am.

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,420
But, yeah, it was a great experience and probably made me realize,

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,500
hey, maybe I can mix it, you know,

107
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,899
with the best and it was a great experience.

108
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,079
I'm told, and again, correct me if I'm wrong,

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,839
but the swim that you did in Tasmania that is still a record to this day,

110
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,860
am I right there?

111
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,779
I believe so.

112
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,680
I believe so.

113
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,259
Susan Cure, who's the president of Tasmanian Swimming,

114
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,100
she takes care of all the records.

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,120
And she said, do you know that you still hold

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,660
an under 15, 400 medley Tasmanian record?

117
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,620
So there you go.

118
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,759
As a 13-year-old.

119
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,800
And that to me is just unbelievable.

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Nine years of age, you have this dream,

121
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,720
you watch the Olympics and the famous Mark Spitz records that he broke.

122
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
But, you know, only four years later,

123
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,319
you win your first national championship as a 13-year-old.

124
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,620
You're at a high school that doesn't even have a swimming team at that stage.

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,079
Did it feel like a natural thing to you?

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,100
Did it come naturally?

127
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,779
Well, my sister would say I was a klutz on land,

128
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,300
so there was no choice and I really liked the water and felt pretty –

129
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,040
well, not initially I didn't like the water.

130
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,699
I was quite a skinny kid.

131
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,100
And I was always cold when we were swimming.

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,060
And I only liked to swim backstroke because I didn't like to get my face wet

133
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,300
when I first started swimming.

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,800
I liked to look around at what was going on.

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,240
But by the end of that first summer, I flipped over and started to, you know,

136
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,019
learn the other strokes and enjoyed it and thought, hey, I might be okay at this.

137
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,860
Yeah, so it is amazing.

138
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,959
Yeah, and my parents are from the Midwest,

139
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,860
and they could barely swim, so it was unusual, I think, for our family.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,240
But my sister was a very good swimmer and my brother was a beautiful swimmer

141
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,839
and, you know, we just all took to it.

142
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,019
So there must be, when you look back,

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,879
some traits that separated you out from other people to get to the level

144
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,259
that you did so consistently for such a long period of time.

145
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,680
Can you name those?

146
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,300
What do you think was the difference for you?

147
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I think consistency in effort and training.

148
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,199
I think consistency in effort and training.

149
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,240
I think consistency in effort and training.

150
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,259
I think consistency in effort and training.

151
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:55,319
I think consistency in effort and training.

152
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:55,420
I think consistency in effort and training.

153
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,300
Mental toughness, I guess.

154
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,019
My in-laws say, you know, you're not a very competitive person, you know,

155
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,199
but I guess in the right environment, and, you know, I was,

156
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,959
but I'm kind of quietly confident, I suppose.

157
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,560
You know, just worked hard.

158
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,600
I think I was very coachable physiologically.

159
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,980
I obviously had some traits that long arms, big heart and lungs,

160
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,100
good feel of the water, and had some very good coaches,

161
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,939
which I think really helped me.

162
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,800
And that really was, started me off to be, you know, a great swimmer.

163
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,959
I had this one coach, and for us,

164
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,819
the biggest deal was to go to the state swimming titles

165
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,939
and beat the team from Memphis, Tennessee.

166
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,000
And he came in and said, we're going to have world champions,

167
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
and we're going to win the national championships.

168
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,899
And we were all kind of looking at him like, what?

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,199
You know, we just want to win the state titles.

170
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,899
And anyway, within three years, we had three world champions.

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Our women's team won the national championship,

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,899
beating teams from Florida.

173
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,300
And California, which were the powerhouse teams,

174
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,959
and everyone's kind of going Nashville, Tennessee, you know.

175
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,740
But our parents worked very hard to get good coaches.

176
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,259
And as I said, I was very fortunate to have some really good

177
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,639
and very tough coaches.

178
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,939
You said 13, you're on your first overseas trip to Australia.

179
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,620
Amazing to me that at 15 years of age, you go to West Berlin

180
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,600
and you win five world championship gold medals.

181
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,819
You're still at school.

182
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:23,959
You win the Jameson.

183
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,620
James E. Sullivan Award for the most outstanding amateur athlete

184
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,060
in the whole United States.

185
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,580
Going back to school in Nashville, how do you go back to class and be normal?

186
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,460
How did you deal with that?

187
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,659
Well, swimming wasn't really a very high-profile sport,

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,179
even though we had a good program in Nashville.

189
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,600
And I went to a small girls' school, and everyone was very supportive of everyone.

190
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,000
And they're like, yeah, yeah, Tracy swims, but, you know,

191
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,600
she's just one of us as well.

192
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,919
So I think, and my family, probably my brother and sister brought me

193
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,279
down to earth and kept my feet on the ground.

194
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,759
But, you know, just pretty normal.

195
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,700
A good balance was always really encouraged.

196
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:09,159
My mom and dad were both teachers, and education was always very important.

197
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,679
And that balance and working at school as well as in the pool.

198
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,159
And that must have stood you in good stead because not long after that,

199
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,039
it's 1980 and the Moscow Olympics was huge.

200
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,899
And arguably that's, you know, you're probably at the peak of your power.

201
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,720
Maybe as a 17-year-old and you win all the events and qualification.

202
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,799
And as I said in the intro, it's possible your favorite for seven gold medals

203
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,860
hitting into 1980 and that build up.

204
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,259
I mean, how devastating was it then to have that boycotted and not be able to go?

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
Yeah, look at the world championships in 78 that you talked about.

206
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,759
That was probably my best competition ever, hands down.

207
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,460
And then, yeah, obviously there was a focus on finally going to an Olympic Games in 1980.

208
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,600
I don't know if it would have gone.

209
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,039
Seven gold medals, probably seven medals.

210
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,279
But there are a few other Americans who were pretty tough in a few events.

211
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,879
But it was devastating.

212
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,519
And I think I didn't really understand the politics.

213
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:15,559
Ironically, it took the Soviets 10 more years to get out of Afghanistan.

214
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,039
So it really wasn't very effective.

215
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,980
It just took an opportunity away from a lot of athletes.

216
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,440
I was fortunate that I was still pretty young.

217
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,779
Yeah.

218
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:31,799
And I guess I had a lot of teammates who made that 1980 team that tried again in 1984.

219
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,559
But it was just four years.

220
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,600
It was a long time.

221
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:41,379
I lost a little bit of motivation in that because I thought I've got four years to get ready.

222
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,600
But it really went quite quickly.

223
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,019
And I did change programs, went to the University of Florida, which was really motivating,

224
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,019
I think, for me.

225
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,259
Trained with a lot of our men's and women's teams, trained together.

226
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,539
So that really helped me.

227
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,279
I had that extra competition in workouts.

228
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,379
So it was devastating.

229
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,639
But as I said, and now I think back, and had I gone to 1980 and had I done well, as well

230
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,500
as I might have, you know, people thought I would do, you know, I might not have tried

231
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,059
very hard in 1984 because in 1984, 21-year-old woman was old.

232
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,879
I was considered past my prime.

233
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,759
And, you know, it was a sport for teenagers in the late 70s, early 80s.

234
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,279
And now we see, you know, women swimming into their 30s and, you know, it's fantastic.

235
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,659
So certainly, but back then where there wasn't the funding and the opportunities there.

236
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,500
So if I had done well and hadn't gone to 84, I might not have met my husband, Mark.

237
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,720
So I think it's meant to be.

238
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,740
And that's the perspective, is it?

239
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,240
Not regret around what could have been.

240
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,500
It's the possibility of what happened because of that.

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,580
Is that how you look back?

242
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,840
Well, that's how I look at it.

243
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,659
I'm lucky because, as I said, I had a lot of friends.

244
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,500
I had a lot of friends who weren't able to make that 84 team or made it and didn't do

245
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,100
as well as perhaps they might have earlier.

246
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,980
But I look at it as it worked out pretty well for me.

247
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,700
You mentioned maybe losing a bit of motivation.

248
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,360
And I think around 82 and 83, some of your international competitors started to go a

249
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
bit faster than you.

250
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,200
You know, quietly said your mental toughness and resilience.

251
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Did that sort of get you going again to think, hey, I've got a...

252
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,580
1984.

253
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:25,440
Was my time?

254
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:34,259
I probably, it was about a year before the 1984 trials in the US where I kind of thought

255
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,399
I better pull my finger out here because I had been going through the motions, still

256
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,659
training, okay, still winning in America, but not internationally.

257
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,659
And that kind of gave me the kick up the butt that I needed.

258
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:52,320
And I knew that that was probably going to be my last major competition.

259
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,659
And so I knew I had to...

260
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,460
Train hard.

261
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:00,279
And I remember the day where it sort of clicked, where I wasn't just going through the motions.

262
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,559
We had on a Saturday morning, we had what our coach called a get out swim.

263
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,919
And he would set a time and if, and he'd pick the swimmer.

264
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,200
And if you did that time, everybody got out of practice, right?

265
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,059
So everybody's like, and he picked me and he picked the 400 individual medley,

266
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,500
which is one of the toughest events on the program.

267
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,720
And so I was like, and he gave me a pretty tough time.

268
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,539
And so I thought, no, I think I can...

269
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,539
I can do this anyway.

270
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:30,399
And I started in the first 200 meters, they were all like, oh, get ready to get back in

271
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:30,779
the pool.

272
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:37,200
But what I did do was I finished the race off in the second 200 meters faster than I

273
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,399
had at the previous NCAA competition, unshaved, unrested, and I did the time.

274
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:50,000
And I think that kind of gave me that spark, like I can still got it, you know, and that

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,159
was probably 10 months before the trials.

276
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,759
So after your first victory...

277
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,539
So your first victory is as a 13-year-old, home Olympic Games in 1984 in Los Angeles and

278
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,200
you win Olympic gold, was it as good as you'd imagined it was going to be?

279
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,019
Oh, absolutely.

280
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,740
I think because my family were there and some of my friends and my high school PE teacher

281
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,179
was there and the crowd was very loyal to the American crowd and you would dive in and

282
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,559
if you came up ahead, the crowd would go wild.

283
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,519
And in my heat swim in the 400 IM on the first day, I got almost too excited and then I

284
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,059
kind of went, I got to settle down here.

285
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,600
You know, I've got this under control.

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,340
But I remember before the final, they take the eight finalists into the ready room to

287
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,940
get ready about 15 minutes before the race.

288
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,399
And my coach said, I want you to come and see me.

289
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,519
And I was expecting a big pep talk and, you know, rah, rah, rah, USA.

290
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,960
And he gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, well, Trace, go have fun.

291
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,080
I was kind of like, what?

292
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait a minute.

293
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:51,980
This is the Olympics.

294
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:54,360
This is what I've worked so hard for so long.

295
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,559
And that's all you have to say.

296
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,179
It was the best advice anybody gave me because there was nothing else I could do in the next

297
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:06,759
15 minutes, but enjoy it and have confidence in the work that I had done.

298
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,820
And it was probably the most enjoyable swim that I ever had.

299
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:11,179
Yeah.

300
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,700
My first Olympic gold medal.

301
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,159
Yeah.

302
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,039
Well, it's the genius of good coaching, isn't it?

303
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,500
To just pick the right mood and it maybe could have either hyped you, isn't it?

304
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,340
That's right.

305
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,659
Yes.

306
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,759
That's kind of what I was expecting.

307
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,320
But Randy, who was our coach.

308
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,919
At Florida, wasn't that type of a coach.

309
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:36,039
Like he was a man of very few words and kind of by his lack of things to say, often you

310
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,460
worked it out yourself and then you kind of went, now, did he make me do that?

311
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,679
Did he want me to do that?

312
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,879
Is that how he, you know, but anyway, he was, he was an excellent coach and we had a lot

313
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,480
of my teammates do very well at those games.

314
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,440
I love what you said a moment ago, Tracey.

315
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,259
You said, you know, I've gone.

316
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,580
There's, you know, seven Olympic gold medals, you're saying medals, but, uh, uh, whatever

317
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,080
the, the, the great time in your life.

318
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,399
And you said, that's to me, I got to meet my husband in 1984 and it not even a problem,

319
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,759
you know, and I keep hearing about the relationship, uh, you and the legendary swimmer, Mark Stockwell

320
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,120
from Australia have, and, and your connection to family being so, so immense for both of

321
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,220
you.

322
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,720
Can you describe what you're like on the home front as a, as a leader of your family?

323
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,340
Well, I think we're a great team and we always support one another.

324
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,659
Um, and especially in front of the kids, even if you disagree, you kind of have to go have

325
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:34,820
a little side conversation, um, like, and, uh, we've always agreed to do that.

326
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:41,120
Um, but we come from very similar values and, um, similar backgrounds, I guess.

327
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:48,419
And, um, you know, we're, Mark's a very good communicator and, um, very good communicator

328
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:54,320
about his feelings, um, which some people might find interesting, you know, for, you

329
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,600
know, men, but, um.

330
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,019
Men of his era, probably, right?

331
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,379
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,460
Was he always like that when you?

333
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,159
Yeah.

334
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:05,480
And look, and you just have to look at his dad was, um, was very emotionally intelligent.

335
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,880
And I think obviously that rubbed off on, on Mark and he's like his mother and that she

336
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,180
was very driven and, um, and he, he gets that from his, his mom.

337
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:23,420
So, yeah, I think it's united, it's, um, love, it's hard work, it's teaching good lessons

338
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,299
to your kids.

339
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,960
Um, and I think we've done good work there.

340
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,559
We share a great mutual friend and, uh, I, uh, I rang him in preparation for this and

341
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,019
he described Sunday night dinner at the Stockwells as just this legendary thing and how much

342
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:38,660
joy you get.

343
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
So he said something really beautiful.

344
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,480
He said, he said, I wish that was more of what the world was like for other people because

345
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,400
you see all the kids are running around, one's cooking potatoes, one's picking up the plates

346
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,220
and Stocky's on the Barbie and Tracy's doing a thing.

347
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,180
But he said, it's just this.

348
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,160
Beautiful sense of community and, and family.

349
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,460
Is that what you've tried to create?

350
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah, that's right.

351
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,099
I think those family traditions and, and so that Sunday night dinner has always been a

352
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,019
tradition we've had, um, borrowed from Mark's eldest sister.

353
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,839
Um, when our kids were little, we used to go to their house, but then as, um, they said,

354
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,220
well, now it's your turn to do it.

355
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,960
And, and we can have anywhere from, you know, seven to 14 people and it is a little chaotic,

356
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,740
but it's a lot of fun and everyone does their job.

357
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,700
And, um, and it's a time when everyone gets to say and talk about what they want to talk

358
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,059
about.

359
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,359
And, um, you know, it's a good opportunity to listen to your kids and, and have debates

360
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,480
about issues.

361
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,079
And, um, yeah, it's a, it's, and it's just warm and full of love and fun and bit of chaos.

362
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,359
And brilliant because, you know, unfortunately for a lot of people, that's not their experiences

363
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,119
and they get that, that opportunity.

364
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,420
And I asked you about this because, uh.

365
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,519
Yeah, in the same context, you know, I love sharing stories like that because to me, that's

366
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,059
where people get to understand more about what happens in, you know, families that are

367
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:02,759
happy and successful.

368
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,299
And, um, I understand, you know, you and Mark have four beautiful children and then you

369
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:12,680
decide to adopt a fifth, a beautiful daughter, Holly, who's just part of the family from

370
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,539
what I understand.

371
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,039
That's a great commitment as a family.

372
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,539
Can you tell us about that decision?

373
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah, look, we didn't adopt her actually.

374
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,940
Um, but we are, her legal were her legal guardian.

375
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,640
She's 25.

376
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,039
Now, but, um, uh, it's a bit of a long story, but to cut the long story short, we were building

377
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,200
a shopping center up in, um, outside of Bundaberg.

378
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,299
And so Mark was spending a lot of time up there and he stayed at a, an apartment block

379
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,019
managed by this lovely old couple.

380
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,000
And, um, his mom and dad would go up as well cause they were involved with the business

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,619
and, um, got, we got to be very friendly with them.

382
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,680
And Mark had met Holly who had about one year.

383
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:02,119
Of age and her mom and a couple of days later, uh, gets a call from Holly's grandmother saying

384
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,400
that Holly's father had killed her mother.

385
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:13,700
Um, and it really had a profound effect on us because our kids were similar age and we

386
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,700
had then decided to set up a foundation to help support Holly's, um, education cause

387
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,500
that was really important to her grandparents.

388
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,720
And they were just near.

389
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,039
We didn't have the means to become, um, um, um, a doctor, um, to be a doctor, as a

390
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,920
child, um, during the age of retirement.

391
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,200
Um, and I didn't have the means by which to have her educated in the way that they wanted.

392
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,480
So we supported her education in those early years when they would come to Brisbane for

393
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,099
specialists appointments or to see doctors.

394
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,960
Um, you know, she'd come and spend the time with our kids.

395
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,099
And as they got older, they realized that, um, they needed to make some planning for her.

396
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,400
And Grandpa wasn't coping very well.

397
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,599
So they asked us if we would look after Holly when they were gone.

398
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,099
And we didn't know how long that was going to be or whatever,

399
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,200
but we thought about it.

400
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,720
We talked to the kids about it.

401
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,039
We were already committed to supporting her education, and so we did.

402
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,759
And at 12 years of age, she came from little town to the big smoke of Brisbane

403
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,680
and a big, noisy family, which would have been,

404
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,660
now that I think about it, quite scary for her, big school.

405
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,059
But she's 25, as I said.

406
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,660
She's got a full-time job, nearly finished uni, and a beautiful girl

407
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,519
and has just fit in the family really well.

408
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,180
What a beautiful story, Jason.

409
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,819
Thanks for sharing it.

410
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,380
So the kids had a debate about it as well.

411
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm able to sit down and play.

412
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,740
Play.

413
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,660
Play a role in that?

414
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,420
Yeah, they probably were – I didn't know what to expect,

415
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,599
but we thought out of respect, you know, it's a big change for a family.

416
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,700
And, you know, I think they thought, well, four, what's another one?

417
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,279
You know, and she was right in the middle.

418
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,779
And I knew things were going to be okay, Luke,

419
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:15,359
when Holly and Emily are number three, and she's about a year younger than Holly.

420
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,480
They had a fight.

421
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,779
They had their first fight.

422
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,740
And doors slamming and yelling at each other.

423
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,799
And then Emily came back out, and she gets on with her day.

424
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,059
Well, Holly stays in her room, so I just went in and knocked on her door

425
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,500
and said, why don't you come back out?

426
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,339
And she said, oh, Emily and I had a fight.

427
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,680
And I said, yes, you did, and it probably won't be the last one you'll have.

428
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,079
And she said, I don't know what to do.

429
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,619
I'm in here, you know, never had a sibling raised by her grandparents.

430
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,119
And I said, well, you can either go give her a hug, give her a nudge.

431
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,779
You can, you know, ignore her if you want, but get on with it.

432
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,160
She's not mad at you.

433
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,880
And, you know, and this won't be the last time.

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,119
And so she came out, and she was a little sheepish.

435
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,960
But I thought, no, no, they're going to be okay.

436
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,099
And, you know, that's what siblings sometimes do.

437
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,240
And, yeah.

438
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,799
I've seen a few of those as well, Tracy, on the home front.

439
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,119
But, yeah, I can still feel the emotion there, isn't it?

440
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,259
Such a profound story, isn't it?

441
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:14,119
And the change I could imagine in, you know, a beautiful girl's life by having that support.

442
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,960
It's an incredible thing that you guys have done as a family.

443
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,099
Well, I think so.

444
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,839
And, you know, we appreciate.

445
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,559
The opportunity and in changing her life.

446
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,400
And she often says, you know, she's met some people from her previous life.

447
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,579
And she says, I look at my life now and what my life might have been, you know,

448
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,839
and she's very appreciative, you know, of it.

449
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,480
Thank you for sharing that.

450
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,880
It's a remarkable story.

451
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,000
Your post-swimming life, as I said in the intro,

452
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,319
incredibly well respected for your leadership in sports administration.

453
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,099
And how enjoyable has that chapter been?

454
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,319
That was great because sports been such a big part of my life.

455
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:04,660
You know, it was nice when I moved to Australia to find a community that in a country that is so sports mad, you know, and I love sport, any sport.

456
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:11,819
And I remember my first position was at the Queensland Academy of Sport as Wilma Shakespeare's to I see.

457
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,799
And, you know, I didn't know what cricket or netball or rugby.

458
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,000
We didn't have an AFL program at the time.

459
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,220
But, you know, I learned a lot about sport.

460
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:31,400
But I had my experience of knowing, you know, in high performance, what makes a difference and some of the key things there.

461
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:39,920
And I really enjoyed learning and working at the QAS, which then Wilma and I and a few others, women,

462
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:48,680
I had noticed that women's sport wasn't really recognized as much back in the early 90s.

463
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,140
And the opportunities for girls.

464
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,799
And women weren't great.

465
00:24:52,779 --> 00:25:00,480
And I had been involved in America with the Women's Sports Foundation to try and raise the profile of women's sport as well.

466
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:12,500
So we kind of got together and created Women's Sport Queensland and create more opportunities and awareness about women and girls in sport because they were performing beautifully.

467
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,019
And but just not getting the recognition.

468
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:20,140
And I think the papers and the media were giving more recognition to.

469
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,339
Dogs and horses than they were to women at the time.

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:31,880
And we tried to, you know, work really hard to to change that and found a lot of good men who supported us, whether it was corporate or through the media.

471
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:42,359
And often men with daughters who appreciate, you know, they think, well, oh, this might be my daughter that might have an opportunity if we do the right thing here.

472
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,960
So I think that was a really good strategy.

473
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,059
And so I've always loved trying to give back to sport because it gave me.

474
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:58,740
So much and really proud of that and, you know, still catch up with lots of our founding members of Women's Sport Queensland.

475
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:19,099
And now you look at Michelle Payne, the in Rio, the women's teams doing so well, the cricket team, the women's AFLW, the NRLW and how the opportunities for women have really increased, which I'm really proud and like to think that we had a little bit to do with that.

476
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:19,920
More than a little bit.

477
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:26,740
It is an incredible legacy, as you said, to start and you look back and it's it's embarrassing and heartbreaking, really, isn't it?

478
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,440
To think that the opportunities that went missing for my elder sister, I think, God, that's the love that you had for sport.

479
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,900
I was given so many more opportunities than you ever were.

480
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,660
And it's tragic in lots of ways.

481
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,660
But it takes people like you that actually decide I'm going to do something about it practically.

482
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,700
And again, it's a great part of your life story and legacy.

483
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,099
The politics of sport as well.

484
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,500
You know.

485
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,859
And Tracey, the Australian Olympic team have their greatest ever success in the pool in Tokyo.

486
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,859
Couldn't be going better.

487
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,900
You've been a great contributor to Swimming Australia for six months, six years.

488
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,660
Sorry, six years on the board and take over from Kieran Perkins as president for nine months.

489
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,720
How do you find that?

490
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,980
It's a challenging environment, isn't it?

491
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,700
Where the politics ends up winning the day.

492
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,759
Yeah, look, I mean, I'm really proud of the six years that I gave to the board of Swimming Australia.

493
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,680
Again, it was an opportunity to give back.

494
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:40,380
And to the sport that I love and has given me so much, I was very, especially proud of being chair of the high performance committee, getting Alex Bauman on board and really putting into place some good strategies to get the team, you know, to we want to be number one in the world.

495
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,059
But I, my time was up.

496
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,220
My term was up.

497
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,079
I had two terms on the board and I could have one more term.

498
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,980
And I knew I was up.

499
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,640
And I knew I was up for reelection.

500
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,859
And I had the support of the board, but we have made some hard decisions.

501
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,420
And I know some of the stakeholders weren't very happy with that.

502
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,559
And there are politics.

503
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,059
And so I didn't take it too personally.

504
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:15,759
Tried to tell the board, maybe we better have a plan B just in case I don't get reelected because, you know, they thought, well, you'll be president, you know, for another couple of years and would have liked to have done that.

505
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,559
But I'm OK with that.

506
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,700
And there's some good people in there.

507
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,220
And but that is the politics of sport.

508
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,579
How much of the heart is Australian?

509
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,839
How much of it's American?

510
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,900
Tracy, there's a loaded question for you.

511
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,940
Oh, that's a hard one.

512
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:40,759
I think I started to change in Sydney 2000 when the four by one men's freestyle relay was happening because I had worked on the QAS for a number of years.

513
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,940
And Ash Callis was on that relay.

514
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,259
I knew Chris Fidler was on that relay and I knew him and his wife very well.

515
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,859
And I remember watching that.

516
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,420
And and Michael Clem and Thorpey, the other two.

517
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,000
Am I correct?

518
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,400
Yep.

519
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:55,799
Yep.

520
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,079
Yep.

521
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,940
Clem led off in a world record.

522
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:06,940
But anyway, and I I thought, oh, my heart is American, you know, although I do have dual citizenship.

523
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,740
But but then halfway through the race, I was kind of like I was just screaming.

524
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,339
I didn't care who won.

525
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,859
And I kind of thought I felt lucky because I had two teams to support.

526
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:19,940
But I remember.

527
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,920
I remember thinking at the beginning, oh, I think the Yanks will win this one.

528
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,480
I'll cheer for the Yanks.

529
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,640
I knew two of the coaches of two of the boys in that team.

530
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,720
But I knew two of the boys in the Aussie team.

531
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:41,940
And I was just it was and probably after that, I think my allegiance has probably swung more to the Australian because I've lived here for longer than I lived in America.

532
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,059
So I got over halfway.

533
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,079
I was half and half.

534
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,720
And now I'm I've been over.

535
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,900
Not longer in America, in Australia.

536
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,420
Beautifully answered, Tracy.

537
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:00,599
I think, you know, you know, that you said something as we were walking into the studio and we're talking about the theme of the podcast.

538
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,539
I'm sharing a bit of the history and the types of conversations you had.

539
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,079
And you said, yes, success leaves clues.

540
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,799
And I said, I actually use that a lot because someone said it on this podcast.

541
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,859
And I want to ask you a series of questions.

542
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,539
We think becoming a bit of a pattern for leadership and what we see in different people from different backgrounds, starting with self-leadership.

543
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,759
Tracy, we feel like it's hard.

544
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,079
Have an influence on others without a sense of your own self-leadership.

545
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,980
Does that make sense to you?

546
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,920
That makes sense to me, I think.

547
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:32,420
And gives you that belief and confidence to then take others with you.

548
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,480
Yeah.

549
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,680
And it's a bit like self-love as well.

550
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,240
And can you love someone else as deeply without loving yourself first?

551
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,140
So I think that's that's I would agree with that.

552
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:47,059
Yeah, it's a beautiful way to describe it, isn't it?

553
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,039
And you're right, isn't it?

554
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,339
It's hard to if you truly.

555
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,319
That stuff comes from inside, doesn't it?

556
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,599
If you're not connected in that way, it's hard to love someone else as profoundly as you just said.

557
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,539
We see leaders are really conscious in whatever environments they are, how they positively impact people on a daily basis.

558
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,980
How have you gone about that?

559
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,519
Look, I kind of think I'm not probably a natural leader.

560
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,000
But then other people say, oh, you are.

561
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,440
But you lead by example.

562
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,920
And I think I'm aware of other people.

563
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,059
And their feelings.

564
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,599
And, you know, for example, at the 84 Olympics, I was one of the captains of the U.S. team.

565
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,359
And somebody came running into my room saying, Tracy, Tracy Rowdy's freaking out.

566
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,779
You know, he's about to swim the race of his life.

567
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,839
And you've been friends with him on the national team for years.

568
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,140
Went through the boycott together.

569
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,680
Can you can you help him?

570
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,339
You know, and I went, oh, OK, sure.

571
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,559
You know, and I wasn't quite sure what I'd find.

572
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,359
But he was he was worried.

573
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,319
He was working himself up.

574
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:49,819
He was.

575
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,440
Talking to people, but not really talking to people.

576
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,299
And I kind of just remember holding his hand.

577
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:02,079
And, you know, we've been through a lot together and we've did a lot, went through ups and downs to get there.

578
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,819
And I said, your family is going to love you, whatever happens.

579
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,700
And I said, but have the confidence in the work that you've done and go out there and, you know, we'll be proud of you and we'll love you, whatever happens.

580
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,619
And he won the men's 100 freestyle and beat one Australian.

581
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,640
And Mark Stockwell, who I hadn't met at that stage.

582
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,619
I mean, I had met to say hello, but.

583
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,839
You might have changed your line if you had a doubt.

584
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,039
Yeah, that's right.

585
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,420
Yeah.

586
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,319
That's a bit ironic, isn't it, as well?

587
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,599
But, you know, I think, yeah, knowing what.

588
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,819
And it's like good coaches knowing, you know, Luke might need, you know, a kick up the bum, but you've got to be softer with that one.

589
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,559
And knowing what.

590
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,660
And it's like your kids as well, I think.

591
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,960
And it's like your employees.

592
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:49,400
You know, you know.

593
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:52,700
How hard you can push one, but you maybe can't push another.

594
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,279
And so it's reading people and being able to motivate them to get the desired outcome.

595
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,460
But then I think you also have to have that.

596
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,180
What is the desired outcome and what is the vision?

597
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:18,779
And, you know, my husband is, I think, very visionary and very good in that role with our own business and is a very good leader and clear thinker about things and where he wants to go.

598
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,559
And good at.

599
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:23,259
And good at communicating where you want to go and taking people with you.

600
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,559
He's like, you're on the bus or you're not on the bus.

601
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,559
It's a great story.

602
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,680
And that actually leads into that creating a vision is really another dimension we see and people are really thoughtful about.

603
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,819
You mentioned Mark and incredible, successful family business that you guys run.

604
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,140
How have you gone in your world about creating the visions for success that you've had and sharing that?

605
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,059
Well, probably done it together with Mark.

606
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,259
And look, I don't work day to day.

607
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:59,359
In the business, but more strategically and supporting him and am a good sounding board, I suppose, for him as well.

608
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:13,260
I think it's, yeah, what sport has taught us how to set goals and then break it down if you must into steps, you know, like my goal of going to the Olympics at nine years of age.

609
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,179
Well, I didn't know how you got to the Olympics, but I could do a staircase and take it step by step by step.

610
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:34,920
And, um, and, but keep an eye on the big picture and the long-term goal, but obviously do things on a daily basis, weekly basis and, and, and hold yourself accountable and responsible for your efforts and your actions.

611
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,260
Curiosities are where we hear a lot of, uh, Tracy for people that seem to have that consistent success.

612
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,699
They're curious and they, through that curiosity, you're constantly learning and constantly wanting to get better.

613
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,539
Is that something that you think of?

614
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:49,239
I'd like to do better at that.

615
00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:03,579
But, um, coming from a family of two teachers and my sister's also a teacher, um, you know, learning has always been important and discussing ideas and trying to consider different, um, you know, options.

616
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:12,219
And I think it's good for young people to learn, you know, how to consider someone else's argument and, um, counter that if you, if you must.

617
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:19,219
But also, um, yeah, I think I'm always curious and, um.

618
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:33,019
Um, but probably could work on that a little bit more and maybe, maybe when you get a little bit older, not that I think I know it all, definitely not, but you kind of just get tired and want to, you know, do things that you enjoy and, um, yeah.

619
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,960
No, I love the self-reflection, isn't it?

620
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,619
It's we knowing yourself really well.

621
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:39,980
It's, uh, sounds like, uh, you do that, um, with ease.

622
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Uh, you, you mentioned it just a little while ago, but we see people who are, um, what we think is consistently happy and successful around really strategic around how they communicate.

623
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,840
How often, how clear they communicate.

624
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,500
Is that something that you've thought about as well?

625
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:55,380
Yeah.

626
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,579
And I think, um, that's one thing.

627
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:01,079
I think Wilma Shakespeare was a real mentor of mine.

628
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:10,900
Um, Wilma coached and played for Australia in netball, um, headed up the AIS's first program in netball, then came to Queensland to head up the QAS.

629
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:15,619
Um, and I was her first, um, kind of deputy.

630
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,619
Um, and I think communication.

631
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:19,219
I learned.

632
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:33,719
I learned from her, but she always said that I had good communication and to have confidence in, um, that ability to listen as well, um, to other people's views, but to then be able to communicate well and clearly.

633
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:37,199
I always find Americans incredibly articulate.

634
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:44,539
I know it's a broad generalization, but as Australians, you, you know, you'll see someone interviewed on a street for, uh, an incident that may have happened.

635
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,179
And is that a common thing?

636
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,219
It seems like Americans are just got an amazing ability.

637
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,059
They express themselves.

638
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,639
You, you've got a puzzled look on your face, maybe in some parts.

639
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,940
Some, some, in some parts of the country, yes.

640
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,619
And it's other parts, maybe not.

641
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:08,619
But I mean, I value, I, I appreciate, um, you know, good education that my parents afforded me and, um, being able to further that at university.

642
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:10,920
And I think that certainly helps.

643
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,480
Collaboration is another thing we see people really value now more than ever and understand the value of it.

644
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,820
How important has that been for you?

645
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,119
Oh, I think, um.

646
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,920
Very important.

647
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,579
I think we're not, you know, alone and, uh, and you can always do things better, I think, with others.

648
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:38,219
And it also helps to have, um, that support and, and, and people may be sharing a different way of doing something and coming up with a good, good outcome for everyone.

649
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,360
Um, I think so.

650
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,619
And I think I'm pretty good at that.

651
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:48,179
I think, um, and maybe, I don't know if it's a female thing or, but just, um, mediating and monitoring and wanting.

652
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,019
I'm, I'm a bit of a.

653
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:50,739
Pleaser as well, I think so.

654
00:37:50,860 --> 00:38:01,420
Wanting to get a good outcome and making sure everyone has their say and, and then, you know, bringing people together and, and coming to a common, um, you know, path.

655
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,019
Um, so I, I think that's very important to work together.

656
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:14,159
And as I said, I think Mark and I work together well as a team as it, whether it's in raising our kids or running a business or our sporting ventures.

657
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,900
Yeah.

658
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,940
It's brilliant, uh, skill and you can just see a sense of calmness being around you.

659
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:26,239
Which I, it sort of exudes out of you, uh, but asking these two final questions to everyone I've sat down with, uh, firstly, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

660
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,139
Ooh, that's a tough one.

661
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:40,679
Look, I mean, I give my husband, you know, he'd be, he'd be up there because he, he, he's probably a little bit more decisive than me and, and clear.

662
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,699
And I, as I said, I'm a bit more that pleaser, let's get everyone together.

663
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,579
And, um, um, and sometimes I wish I was more decisive.

664
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,239
This isn't, and could just say, this is how it's going to be.

665
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,559
And maybe if it's your own business, you can be a bit more dictatorial.

666
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:02,460
I don't know if Mark would like me to say that, but, but, you know, sometimes somebody's got to call the shots and make the call.

667
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,079
And, um, and, and I think he's also, they're very good at taking people with him.

668
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,699
Um, and Wilma, I think, uh, you know, I've spoken about her.

669
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:18,139
I think she was an incredible leader and, and I look at how many young people, young now.

670
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:26,260
And many younger than me, but my vintage that she has influenced that are some of the best high-performance brains in the world.

671
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:34,679
Um, and she's got fingerprints on them and that, that phrase of, um, success leaves clues.

672
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:46,139
I heard that from Chelsea Waugh, who was one of Wilma, who worked at the QAS and then went over and worked with Wilma in England, in the UK sport, and has written a very good book called The Talent Lab.

673
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,199
Um.

674
00:39:47,199 --> 00:40:03,099
And, um, you know, and Alex Bauman worked for Wilma and, you know, and we all, you know, just really appreciate, um, the mentorship and the leadership that she provided us to help us to get to where we are today.

675
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,320
And I think that's a good sign of leadership.

676
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,340
Yeah, that's a, it's a great thought, isn't it?

677
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,079
The effect that you've had and how many people that you've empowered to be great leaders as well.

678
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,139
And it sounds like she had an incredible, uh, influence from the sport of, legend of the sport of netball.

679
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:17,179
Yeah.

680
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:30,320
As you said, in the spirit of collaboration, um, you've had so many diverse parts of your life and, and clearly, uh, you know, the Olympic, uh, swimming part is a huge chapter, but has there been anyone who's thought, if I could collaborate with that person, that would be fascinating.

681
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,659
It could be any area of your life.

682
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,099
Has there been anyone that springs to mind in terms of collaboration?

683
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:45,599
No, I guess because I've had a lot of opportunities to engage with in the Olympic world and in the swimming world in particular.

684
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,840
Um.

685
00:40:47,199 --> 00:41:11,860
You know, Bob Bowman, who coached Michael Phelps, um, you know, he's my age and we kind of swam at the same time and we've had a little bit to do with each other, but I just look at the success that he's had with not only Michael, but now he's got this several, uh, swimmers, including Léon Marchand from France, who I think next year in Paris will be incredible.

686
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:13,059
Um.

687
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,079
No, it'd probably have to be something at a totally different.

688
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,480
Field, but I don't know what it might be.

689
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:34,480
We've got creative daughters, um, who both dance and sing and act and, you know, and I always think where'd they get that from, but maybe I need some collaboration in that field to inspire me, my creativeness.

690
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,260
Is that, uh, have any of them followed the path?

691
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,480
I mean, two Olympic parents, has that been passed down the gene a bit to the kids or?

692
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Well, our son is swimming and he's swimming at, um.

693
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,039
And, uh, is that the world championship trials?

694
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,420
Um, he's a sprinter like his dad.

695
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,840
Um, his twin sister was a quite a good water polo player.

696
00:41:57,179 --> 00:41:59,860
Um, but then as I said, we've got the performers.

697
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:06,099
It's a performance, you know, whether it's on the stage or in the pool or, um, wherever.

698
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:16,679
Well, as I said, uh, I only hear about the, uh, incredible, um, environment it is when people are lucky enough to be around the Stockwells and, and just to hear the connection that, you know, your relationship.

699
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:27,300
And, uh, it's, uh, it's a special one to share aside from having a record that is just quite amazing when you look back and think what you were doing at such a young age.

700
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,079
Uh, thanks so much for sharing your story today, Trey, I heard a lot about it.

701
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,559
It's been really nice to spend the time with you.

702
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:31,980
Thanks a lot.

703
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,059
Well, thank you, Luke.
