1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,460
How do you create and lead an environment where people feel supported and connected

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,820
in a way they've never felt before, where there is a focus on developing a better person

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,239
as a priority, and in doing so, you create a better team?

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,420
I had to work on myself every single day to be up to the task of coaching the team and

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,219
had to work hard to be ready for them.

6
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,030
Today, it's Luke Darcy.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,810
The idea of self-improvement and leadership, both on and off the field, has been a lifelong

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,670
passion of mine.

9
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,710
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and have had the privilege

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,250
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry, and the arts that have helped

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,909
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership, where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,490
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:13,670
I sit down with legendary NRL leaders.

14
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,769
I'm here with NRL coach Trent Robinson, who talks about how his role is to serve the players,

15
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:22,849
what spirituality means in a sporting environment, and nurturing players to be brutal on the

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,510
field and open-hearted and vulnerable off it.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,579
Well, Trent Robinson is a coaching legend of the NRL.

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,980
At just 35 years of age, he was appointed as head coach of the Sydney Roosters and remarkably

19
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,640
coached them to a premiership in his rookie season.

20
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,879
Trent has gone on to become the only coach in Roosters history to win over 150 games

21
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,980
and is the longest-serving coach in the club's history.

22
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,299
In 2018 and 2019, Trent coached the Roosters to back-to-back premierships.

23
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,200
In 2013, 14, 15, and 18, the Roosters won the minor premiership under Trent's leadership.

24
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,739
He has been recognised for his achievements as the Dallium Coach of the Year and the Rugby

25
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,719
International Federation Coach of the Year.

26
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,319
It is a remarkable time in sports leadership.

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,900
And Trent Robinson, great to catch up with you.

28
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,680
Thanks for your time today.

29
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,520
Thanks, Luke.

30
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,419
Good to be here.

31
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,539
At 35 years of age, you're given a senior leadership position.

32
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,479
In sport, head coach of the Roosters.

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,719
What made you such a capable leader at that age?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,120
I was so nervous for that job for months.

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,340
For months.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,300
You know when your ambition's high and then you keep sort of throwing yourself into stuff

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,060
that you're not sure if you're ready for but you think you'll catch up?

38
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,360
Well, that was the case with this job.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,219
I remember I took off to France.

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,639
I was at the club in 2010.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
We went to a grand final.

42
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,419
And then I left to go to Catalans in the south of France to coach in the Superleague

43
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,520
at 33.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,860
And I was head coaching and I was really, yeah, cutting my teeth there trying to practice

45
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,039
different management styles, different playing styles.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,479
And then out of the blue, the funny story about Nick Politis, our chairman, I didn't

47
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,740
even interview for the job at the Roosters.

48
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,860
I signed and then the board rang me and asked me what I was going to do.

49
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:23,680
And I made up some stuff on the spot and then went about, I knew we had a good team.

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,800
I knew we had a really good team.

51
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,319
We had to do some things when we came in.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,419
But it was, oh, I was, I had to work on myself every single day to be up to the task of coaching

53
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,000
the team.

54
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,780
And, you know, that's, you know, I had to work hard to be ready for them.

55
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,539
Well, that's a remarkable story.

56
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,000
I didn't realize that Nick Politis, legendary figure.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,099
He played in New South Wales and in rugby all around.

58
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,240
So he didn't even interview for the job.

59
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,300
He saw something in you and said, Trent Robinson, you're my man.

60
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,180
Is that how it happened?

61
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:53,639
Yeah.

62
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:59,340
So I played here for four years, never played the top level, but I came here out of school,

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,000
had four years at the Roosters and then came back and coached in 2010.

64
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,680
And we had quite a successful year.

65
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,979
We went to the grand final that year and then I left.

66
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,240
And I had a good rapport with players.

67
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,979
And Nick usually doesn't ask.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,980
He doesn't ask too many people's opinions before he makes a decision.

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,779
And that was the case.

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,740
I felt really lucky.

71
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,839
I got told I had the job and then I signed within a couple of days.

72
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,660
And then a couple of days later, I had to tell him what I was going to do.

73
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,360
So, yeah, it was definitely not a formula that people go by very often.

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,279
But, yeah, it's been a, you know, a complete change in my life.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
What Nick did.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,860
In that week.

77
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,500
And I've had to pay that back ever since as well.

78
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,459
Certainly paid it back with incredible success and what you do and what you continue to do.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,779
Triple Premiership coach and an amazing history as a senior.

80
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,139
I wanted to touch on that briefly, Trent.

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,740
As a young kid, I understand you played soccer and you're an elite swimmer.

82
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,899
And then you found your love of rugby league.

83
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,100
As you said, you came through the Roosters and ended up playing a couple of games with the West Tigers and I think Parramatta.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,779
So it was a three-game short professional career.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was a three-game short professional career here in the NRL before going over to France.

86
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:26,800
It seems to me, you know, without having to study, that not many coaches achieve your level of coaching success that didn't play more senior football, whatever sport.

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,639
Did you always feel like as a player you were maybe destined to be a great coach or is that a bit of a stretch?

88
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,420
For most people, when they're in a sport and they're not at the top level, you often feel like you're on the outskirts.

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,060
You often feel like you're not.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,139
You know, at the center of that club, you're sort of an add-on.

91
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,839
You know, a lot of reserve graders or second teamers feel that way.

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
And I guess that's what I felt playing.

93
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,860
I just couldn't get the most out of myself to play that top level.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:10,279
And at that time, my mum was a swimming teacher and I often, I was very aware of my coaches throughout my junior years.

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,819
Even at a young age, I was aware of my school teachers.

96
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:19,939
And I, you know, I was working in gyms while I was going through uni and I was coaching.

97
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:27,639
So I'd always like learn, I was always keen on the art of coaching, on how to get the best out of somebody at different times.

98
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,680
But it wasn't until I went to France that I really learnt that I loved rugby league.

99
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,040
You know, when something gets taken away from you and you, you know, no one cares about rugby league.

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,680
It's not a big sport over there.

101
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,459
But then I realised how much I loved it.

102
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,459
And then two things happen.

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,379
I love the sport.

104
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,339
I found out I loved it, even though it wasn't very big over there.

105
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,740
And I was lucky enough to have a couple of people that would pick up somebody that doesn't have any real experience.

106
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
Because this is, this is common in our sport is people in all sport.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,800
A former legend player is really good to have around because by osmosis,

108
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:12,800
they pass on a lot.

109
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:18,740
They have a lot of stuff that, that, that creates great teams and they were a part of that.

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,139
But is that person going to learn the art of coaching?

111
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,139
And sometimes they do.

112
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:30,560
There's good examples of that, but sometimes they don't, they rely on what they did as a player.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,279
And so I guess what I had to do when I came into coaching was I couldn't rely on that.

114
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,779
So I had to rely on the art of coaching.

115
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:40,779
How do I manage somebody?

116
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:41,779
And the absolute technical depth.

117
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:42,779
And that's, that's a big part of it.

118
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,220
The technical detail and tactical detail of the sport.

119
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,139
So that was, that was my method of, of sort of getting there, but I was lucky enough to

120
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,600
have a couple of people that didn't need me to be a great player for them to employ me.

121
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
That was, that was really key.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
It's interesting.

123
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,759
Isn't it watching sometimes the great champions of sport that go to coaching struggle to understand

124
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,939
why players find it so hard, something that they were able to do maybe more easily than

125
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,939
most.

126
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,060
Yeah.

127
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
I mean, it's, it's a challenge for all the former and former all time legends, and it's

128
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
harder for them to relate.

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,000
Have you found that you can have more empathy for the challenges of trying to find your

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
best in sport because it was a challenge for you?

131
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Definitely.

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,579
Cause you know, you'll get to a situation where a coach will say, look, I need you to

133
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,579
do this.

134
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,879
And even though mentally you're thinking, I know what they want me to do, but physically

135
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,100
you just can't always get it done.

136
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
And there's a frustration point.

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
There's that, that observing point in between what they want me to do and what they really

138
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
want me to do.

139
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
And so there's a frustration point.

140
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,259
There's that, that observing point in between what they want me to do and what they want me to do.

141
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:41,340
And sometimes they can't always get it done.

142
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,200
what they want you to do and what you're trying to do and if you sit in that observing point and

143
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,620
say well um you know why can't they do it there's often some factors that you need to work on as a

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,340
coach where um a lot if you don't observe that part of your coaching and you just go well if

145
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,120
you can't do it then you're not good enough then you're missing the art of coaching you're missing

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,639
the art of getting um the best out of somebody or adapting well either a team it could be a whole

147
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:19,600
team or it could be an individual and i was i was often as a player in that area um sort of going

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,779
like i know what he's thinking he's either doubting himself or he doesn't understand the

149
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,899
steps that need to get there technically or or whatever it is um so i had to observe it because

150
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,100
it was in me and i love the the understanding of that

151
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,320
trent for me i always found playing sport that the coaches often through the year i was in were

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,519
really adept at pointing out what you couldn't do and and that was almost like a career defining

153
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,059
statement you can't kick well enough or you're not agile and then i reckon there's a generation

154
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:55,379
like you saying i need you to do this and i'm going to coach you to find a way now that doesn't

155
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,240
always work but is that too simple a way to explain it that that part of the art of coaching

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,120
is actually finding players that you think you can teach a way to do something that maybe they

157
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,240
even thought they couldn't do themselves yeah i reckon the biggest one of the biggest things in

158
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,559
in coaching is um there was you know and there still is and and you know when i'm at my worst i

159
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,179
coaching i feel this way as well but we're at the service of the players coaches need to understand

160
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:30,320
that we're there to serve the players they're not there to serve us now we might be in in a in a

161
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,679
authority role because we're the head coach and we decide on whether they play or not but

162
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,639
we serve the players so as soon as we work out that um the old john wooden quote about it's not

163
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,100
what they hear it's it's it's not what you say it's what they hear and and as soon as you work

164
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:56,080
out that your job is to work out how do they hear what you're trying to put across then that's that's

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,580
your role as a coach um and i and i feel like um ego plays a big part in coaching um you know the

166
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:04,919
the

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,379
external ego on on authority and what you think you should represent you know and that's and

168
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:16,840
there's no difference you know it plays a part in myself and and that as well but reducing that

169
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,860
and understanding the service aspect of our of our profession and then okay now what does service

170
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,179
mean what are the tools that i need to service the players um and for a young player it might be um

171
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,580
the progressions that need to lead to them to be tactically or

172
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,080
technically

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,100
um

174
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
the progressions that need to lead to them to be tactically or technically very proficient

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,019
in a tackle defense but a senior player it might be the management of them

176
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:48,279
moving from a single life to a married life with kids and they're transitioning to that

177
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,639
that that different role and fatherhood that you may need to have understanding of managing that

178
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,580
and then it varies you know and and um i feel like that's what we forget in the essence of

179
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,080
coaching is that um the service aspect of it um

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,820
and the continual search for their understanding about what we're trying to get across

181
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,799
it's such a profound thing that you just said that trent from an era that you know you serve

182
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,539
the players you're there to to serve their needs and get the best out of them a lot of people

183
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:25,820
listen to this who will be running small business or big business or interested in education or

184
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,700
other parts of their life and it's it's such we're seeing that unique leaders like you have

185
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,740
changed the whole way we lead now in flipping it on its head it's not hierarchy it's not hierarchy

186
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,019
i'm in the big office and you know i don't think the senior coaches i started with it would have

187
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,220
been hard to get a conversation out of them in the first two years whereas you're now working

188
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,059
out in a very different way that you know imagine that as an employee or a leader in a business to

189
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,100
say i'm actually serving the people under me to get the best out of them it relates to so much

190
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,700
is it is that a unique thought that that you when you were transitioning into a coach that you had

191
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,019
or is it something that when you were playing did you feel like that was missing i felt like the

192
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,720
best coaches that or teachers

193
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:13,360
that i had um had that understanding of me and and and and of how i learned the best and how i

194
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,059
needed to progress so i think that was definitely from the best teachers that i had and then the

195
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:25,299
other part of it for me was um as i was coming through i definitely started coaching feeling

196
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:33,500
like i had to in the first year i felt like i had to act like a coach you know i had to um yell when

197
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,720
they didn't do something well and then i had to act like a coach and then i had to act like a coach

198
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,360
well and i had to you know drop someone because they weren't playing well enough and you know i

199
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,600
felt like i was rote learning coaching um and i had you know early doors i even it was one of the

200
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,000
years i think it was my third year of coaching i felt like i had an average team and i capped the

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,159
team in my head not not externally but in my head i thought um they're not a good team they can only

202
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,720
achieve that much and guess what they didn't so you know i put a limit on what i was doing and

203
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,799
what i thought i could achieve with that team and i coached to that limit and so those lessons

204
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,799
have been really good early about you know finding my style of coaching like how am i going to coach

205
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:22,320
um what do the players need not just what do i want to do who am i but also who are they how do

206
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,539
they um how do they need to be coached um but then also allowing um the freedom for those players to

207
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,440
players will exceed your expectations you don't dictate

208
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,559
play all the time and and if you don't put a cap on them sometimes they'll underachieve but often

209
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,440
they'll overachieve there's there's so many players where when you start with them you think

210
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,179
you know i wonder you coach them to get the best out of them without limit and often they will

211
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:59,740
overachieve with that so clearly your lessons in in france uh served you well when you arrive at

212
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,120
35 years of age which you know to me is incredibly young and one of the youngest ever

213
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,659
coaches at a head coaching role in the nrl and then you win it in your first year you win the

214
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,639
minor premiership a remarkable start to your career did you feel was that belief in you trent

215
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,379
that first year did you feel like there was something special that you could take them all

216
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:25,960
away as i said i woke up every morning for months nervous about going into work just but that was a

217
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:34,120
part of my process about i had to accelerate my learning i was 35 um i'd only been coaching for

218
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:42,539
uh what was it you know six years seven years up until that date so i was i knew i had to learn

219
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:48,759
quickly and then we did some things in that pre-season we needed to shape this the the team

220
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,700
a little bit better we had a bit of a soft underbelly we were a pretty team but we weren't

221
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,559
a hard team so we made some recruitment changes around that time and then a couple of additions

222
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,379
would really help having sunny bill williams come in and james maloney and we ended up having a

223
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,639
squad and then i remember halfway through the year we had a staff um a couple of days in one of the

224
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,860
buys and we sort of said these guys are ready to win it's up to us to to manage them because you

225
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,120
know we felt like we had to be good enough to win as as player as staff because the players were

226
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:34,039
ready um and so i felt like every day was setting an emotional control on myself i had to make sure

227
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,519
that the nervousness that i was waking up with wasn't seen externally i had to try and um set my

228
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,960
energy for the day um and the thing that my skills were at would i could coach him technically and

229
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,759
tactically i was really confident in what i had as a product i just didn't know all the other stuff

230
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,039
that went to being a head coach whether i was capable of um so i sort of had to learn on the

231
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:04,420
on the run clearly you were you can hear you know reading about a lot of your work the psychology

232
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,779
of your work and you know connecting your players to each other and themselves and

233
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,559
coaching the whole person seems an incredible passion and it's you know really interesting

234
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,380
to hear how you did that in in real time as a 35 year old and i wanted to jump uh to one of my

235
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,279
favorite stories in australian sport and it's clearly going to be one that resonates with you

236
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:30,240
and watching cooper cronk play a grand final with a broken shoulder affected broken scapular it was

237
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,700
as we found out afterwards it was one of the most courageous things i think i've ever seen in in

238
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,700
sport and i i want to ask you about the complexity for you as a leader you've got this great on-field

239
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,759
leader who's clearly playing you know at best at 30 into a grand final how hard was that decision

240
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,640
for you to give the green light to play understood it was up until the hour before the game before you

241
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,980
went with it was it a really challenging call to give that the green light and can you talk us

242
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,640
through how you went about it there's no one as strong mentally as cooper cronk that i've ever

243
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
come across like i've coached some amazing players i've coached some amazing players i've coached some

244
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:11,259
players but i don't know anybody that would have played in that game it was a it was a clean break

245
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:17,500
of a scapular it was incredible the break in that and cooper cronk i've never seen somebody

246
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,059
dictate to themselves how they should feel more often than cooper so therefore that was the

247
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:31,160
biggest part the injury wasn't going to play a part in him wavering mentally during throughout

248
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,720
the game he actually did it i think it was after about 32 or 33 years old and he was

249
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,599
injured for about 33 minutes before half time in the game before and he got treated during half time

250
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,519
i remember them working on his shoulder and then he played a whole other 40 minutes with this broken

251
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:51,500
scapula you know and he kept it away from trouble and it was incredibly painful but it was sort of

252
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,960
funny we what happened was i think it was saturday night we played sunday morning we met in the

253
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,720
doctor's office we sat there broken scapula um a bit controversial but we said okay what are we

254
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
going to go out with because we're going to play a game and we're going to play a game and we're

255
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,779
going to play a game because we won't you know we said he was going to have a shoulder injury but

256
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,839
we didn't want to go into we didn't want to say that he had a broken scapula and then we talked

257
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:20,880
about is he going to play or not and it was sort of a um and this is where cooper was really strong

258
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,200
he said right yeah let's let's sort of go and find every method we can um and um what we'll do

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,380
is we'll prepare we won't be able to prepare all week so we knew how to play with cooper in the

260
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,220
world and we knew how to play with him and he was a very good player and we knew how to play with

261
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,500
him and he was a very good player and we knew how to play with him but we didn't play that's what we

262
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,720
had to plan for um which sort of was true but we had to have a plan with him being on the field and

263
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,539
not really playing as well but so what what we did was that sunday afternoon i sat down and went

264
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,359
through the strategy about how we would play with and without him um walked in monday morning with

265
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,619
the coaches and the senior players and this is sort of an important part of it i had a slight i

266
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:04,359
had a different player that was going to play in in the position and the so we had the strategy about

267
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,380
tactics about moving players to play extra half roles and who was going to play in the halfback

268
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,579
position and the senior player said no i don't think we should play him i think we should play

269
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:21,960
another player and then we talked about the the strategy of the game and so we worked it out that

270
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,420
morning and then we went and presented it to the team and then we trained that way all week

271
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,779
and then the method that we had with cooper didn't play was actually it was like a fake halfback role

272
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,019
um and we were going to swing our two young players in latrell mitchell and joey marner was

273
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,259
playing as the extra halves so when we decided that whether cooper was going to play or not

274
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:53,140
that was the ideal scenario anyway because we could cover for cooper not being on the field so

275
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:03,640
and this is the funny thing i don't remember it was such an easy decision because and i'm not sure

276
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,079
why but it was really clear that he was either

277
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,319
in or out and we had our two plans the players were really clear and then we went about

278
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,279
training that week and then cooper said he was out friday morning and then he did a different

279
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,680
medical intervention friday afternoon and he said i'm right to play and then he asked the

280
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,720
players on the saturday morning are you right if i play but don't basically you know i'm going to

281
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,160
play a decoy role they went yep you're without a doubt we want you in there

282
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,019
and then we had to wait till an hour before to see if the injection actually worked to numb the pain

283
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:50,460
and we went with it it was you know it caused a big distraction for the opposition

284
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:59,460
but it was just yeah it was just an incredible feat from cooper but also from the guys around

285
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,200
him to handle the changes within the biggest week of their lives amazing sporting story there's so

286
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,420
so many layers to it, isn't it? You initially go to the bravery of playing with a clean break of

287
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,660
your scapula, which is extraordinary. And then what you're able to do and the tactics around

288
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,799
the part that I think I love the most out of that trend is the fact that you came with a plan to

289
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,720
your senior players and they told you, no, they wanted a positional change. I mean, for most

290
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,420
people in senior leadership roles, that's a really hard thing to take on board, your players

291
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,900
feeding back to you that there's a different alternative. What was that like for you?

292
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:43,279
That's, you know, our job is to line up and do most of the strategy, but we've got to leave space.

293
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,240
Some of the most intelligent players in our game for now and in the future are actually on the

294
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:56,519
field. So leaving space for that choice and then with that choice comes much more buy-in to the

295
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:03,640
way that you're going to play. So that was really natural because, and that was the key, the way

296
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,160
that a couple of those guys responded.

297
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:14,240
Because the guy that actually played the halfback role was going to play that fake position. He was in that

298
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,279
meeting and he'd never played it before and he said, I'll do it. And then Luke Keery, who was the

299
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:26,339
best player on the ground in that day, he also said, I will cover Cooper in his roles and I'll do it this

300
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:35,079
way. So I feel like our job is to do the majority of the legwork, but also you need to offer choice.

301
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,779
To get the ultimate buy-in for your players, because then they feel like there's ownership in

302
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,400
the game plan.

303
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,500
And you still have to, if you're Cooper Cronk, stand there and lay a tackle as he did on, I think,

304
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,140
10 occasions, you know, 110 kilo powerhouse machines running at him. And he was able to find

305
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,220
a way remarkably with that injury to do it on grand final day against his own side. An incredible

306
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,980
story in every sense. I read that you've got an acute sense of history, Trent, and around your

307
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,000
club and what the Roosters mean and that you really take the players on a journey of understanding

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,220
it. And I've been reading a bit about it in preparation for this, and I didn't quite understand

309
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,960
the East's history and that Bondi and Paddington, those suburbs were really essentially working

310
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,779
class and it was not where people wanted to live. Clearly they're sought after now. And

311
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,900
tell us why that's important for you to take your players on that journey and do they buy into it?

312
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,660
And does it mean something? Definitely. I think anybody, you know, the idea of

313
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:45,480
I'll go back to the ego of a coach. I can't walk in here. I can't think that my role is to

314
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,480
just plan for the future. I have to honour the past as well. And sometimes you have to unload,

315
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:59,960
unpack some of the bits of your DNA that you don't like and discuss. And it's like yourself,

316
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,440
you want to improve yourself. So you have to talk about that. And then you have to pattern

317
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,180
and continue.

318
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,079
You want some of the parts of the history that are vital to your club and your success.

319
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:17,440
And that's why for us, you know, we're seen as quite a wealthy and glamorous club in rugby

320
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,579
league. You know, we represent the city and, you know, the Opera House and, you know, the

321
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:30,259
Centrepoint. They're all on our land and Bondi Beach and the wealthy houses of Vaucluse and

322
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:35,180
Point Piper and all of that type of stuff. But as I say, we aren't the right people.

323
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
We aren't the right to live in this area. We aren't the right to represent this area.

324
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,599
This was the slums of Sydney were in our area. And all the immigrants that kept moving into

325
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,480
the area over the last hundred years have gone into our jersey. They've rolled up their

326
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:58,519
sleeves and they've built this city. And so the good stuff that's come out of that

327
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,579
in the last 20 to 30 years, you know, will stand tall, put your shoulders back and feel

328
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,079
comfortable.

329
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,180
Yeah.

330
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,039
I'm confident about the club that's been built in this area and who we represent, that

331
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:16,759
we've earned the right. So, I mean, I'm not a suit guy. I don't, you know, I wear a suit

332
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,440
to every game, all the games that I've coached. But that's because I represent this area.

333
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,339
You know, it's not, if I was at the Catalans in France, I'm not wearing a suit because,

334
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,539
you know, I represent the club. I don't represent myself in that. So, trying to honour that

335
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:35,079
history is really important. And we've had to go through a lot of things. We've had to

336
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,200
pull out some of the dark times as well.

337
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,920
So, I love the connection to storytelling and clearly your history and what that means

338
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,619
in the world of professional sport now that is transient. Players move more than they

339
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:51,779
ever have done in the history of the game. But I believe you're also, you know, big on

340
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,960
grabbing stories from elsewhere and themes of, you know, for a particular year. And I

341
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,000
understand you really delved into the Barcelona story with Pep Guardiola and Messi at their

342
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,960
peak. How do you combine that? Where does the...

343
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,359
How does the connection work with, you know, a Spanish giant in the round ball game? How

344
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,039
do you connect that back to the Roosters?

345
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,740
Well, I think that's the, you know, there's inspiration in many parts. And we've used,

346
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,819
you know, who are like the guys that are really good storytellers and have been for a while

347
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:30,779
are the New Zealand coaches. You know, the history of their storytelling have been really,

348
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:34,859
really strong for a long time. So, some guys that are really good at this.

349
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,359
You know, Verne Cotter was over in French Rugby Union for a long time and he really

350
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:46,460
bought in. I think they won 74 home games in a row. And they had the theme that they

351
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,599
would protect their home. Scott Robertson, who's won many titles with the Crusaders.

352
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Scott's really good at telling the story through themes. And we've often discussed, yeah, the

353
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,599
different theming. And the guys enjoy it.

354
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,339
They enjoy an attachment to a story. And often, you know, there has to be the passing

355
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:15,859
on of your DNA and your understanding of your history. But there's also that learning, whether

356
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:23,539
it's been Barcelona and that, you know, that big city and representing that city and the

357
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:30,319
way that they played and the style that they played with was really big. And there's been

358
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,980
other ones that we've used each year.

359
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:41,519
It's a different theme that ties into the year and how we want to play. But I think

360
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,460
it's such a, it's a cool way to get everyone to buy in. And also, you know, you've got

361
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,259
to do it with the families and the staff as well, like everybody. There's about 250 people

362
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:53,680
that are a part of that story.

363
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,019
Verne, I can hear the lifelong learning part of who you are and the people that I've spoken

364
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:11,099
to that know you will say that you are obsessed with improvement and learning. And that is

365
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:18,200
where we've crossed over ever so slightly in the world of a leader and my friend, Matt

366
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,980
Waterwitz, and the group that you've been meeting with regularly. I wanted to ask you

367
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,440
a bit about that, if you're okay. Justin Langer, Australian cricket coach, John Worsfold, a

368
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,400
legend of AFL, along with Don Pike, who's had an incredible history. Your assistant

369
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,160
coach, Matt King, Melbourne Storm legend, if you don't mind me mentioning his history

370
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,660
there. Will Weaver started it, who's now an Australian basketball coach with the Houston

371
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,220
Rockets. Can you talk me through?

372
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,099
Why that sort of connections work for you, Trent, and what you've got out of it?

373
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:53,160
What Matt set up and you guys are involved with, it's just, the first thing is, you think

374
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,500
it's about sharing your knowledge, but what it is, is it just, the first thing is, it's

375
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:07,980
a real support. I haven't met Woosh in person, and I've heard of Woosh for a long period

376
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,039
of time. I haven't met JL. I got to just meet Pike.

377
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:16,220
If you're familiar with Joaquin, he was from Australia, and he was a champion in the rugby

378
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,180
and football, but he had a dear old friend who was from Australia, and he was a major

379
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,059
fan of mine, and I looked him up, and I was like, well, I don't know if you know him.

380
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:28,859
And he said, well, he's a very good coach, but he hasn't been here for a long time. I

381
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,440
don't know him. I don't know him very well, and I said, I don't know him for over 10 years.

382
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,160
He said, well, he's not a good coach. I don't know him, but he's not a good coach. I was

383
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
the second player to me.

384
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
And that was the only person I knew.

385
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,960
It was a very good player. I was the second player. That's the only person I knew. He was,

386
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,339
You feel like you've had that relationship with them

387
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:48,539
and that depth of relationship and that's probably the biggest thing.

388
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,759
That's why we don't stop.

389
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,000
You know, I think it would have started as a six-week meetings

390
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,680
for six weeks during COVID in April and now we're still going

391
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,759
every two weeks and we make Will jump on from Houston Rockets

392
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,700
and tell us some MBA learnings and we don't want to stop

393
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,299
because it's become our little coaching community.

394
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,579
And then there's the other bits about like let's share some

395
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:22,960
of the theming or let's share some of the, you know,

396
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,980
whether it's how to set up a pre-season or lots

397
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,880
of different learnings.

398
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's been wonderful.

399
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,200
It's been absolutely wonderful to be a part of a group

400
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,000
that cares so much and is willing to share openly to get their teams

401
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,579
and clubs better.

402
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,900
And, Jim, we're sort of excited about and we, you know,

403
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,559
through telling these stories and we really appreciate you being generous

404
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,380
enough to do it that there is something in that for a lot of people potentially.

405
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,200
The word I use is almost like your own personal board of directors

406
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,740
without wanting to make it sound corporate because it's not necessarily that.

407
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,259
But to have a group of people you can reflect with and bounce ideas off

408
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,319
and as you described so articulately there to be able to, as you said,

409
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,579
you haven't met some of these people but they're probably lifelong friendships

410
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
out of it as well.

411
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,200
Is it something you could see a benefit for other people who wanted

412
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,839
to form a group that meet you at the same level and support each other

413
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,680
in the way that you've done it?

414
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,920
I will do this for, you know, this form for the rest

415
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,680
of my coaching life, you know, or business life.

416
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,019
You can't – so I'll have, you know, I'll have something that will be big

417
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:38,240
for me that will come up and the ability to go and ask the question.

418
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,599
You know, and they will have genuine, varied solutions to that.

419
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,680
You know, and the idea of sharing that knowledge between a group

420
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:57,680
that also don't have any – they don't have any ties to the club,

421
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,920
that there's no biases that need to come into play.

422
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:08,920
So it's that pure honesty that they give you and they're just –

423
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,619
that is really important to have in your professional life.

424
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,059
You know, you can do it in your personal life as well,

425
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,559
which sometimes comes up, but your professional life,

426
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:30,930
it's so important that people openly share and get advice

427
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,950
but from common people but outside your own field.

428
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:40,450
And, yeah, it's just been a wonderful experience.

429
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,930
Yeah, we're really, you know, grateful that you were prepared

430
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,690
to be part of it and excited on the 10th of February next year

431
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,230
if schedules line up.

432
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,509
Trent and all those guys are going to get together at a summit in Adelaide.

433
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:56,990
We'll leave you the details at elitacollective.com

434
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,109
if you're interested in that group getting together,

435
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,829
which I can't wait to be a fly on the wall to see those friendships in person.

436
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,990
So it's worth getting to the Adelaide Convention Centre on the 10th of February.

437
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:06,930
I'll give that a small plug.

438
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,750
And Elita Connect is the program that Trent's talking about

439
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,429
that we've been – you know, we've been talking about for a long time.

440
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,210
We've been really passionate about seeing unfold before our very eyes.

441
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,190
I hear a lot, Trent, when listening to you and in the past,

442
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:20,449
a sense of spirituality.

443
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:25,989
It's maybe not something that sport would see that link in the past.

444
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,349
Is that something that you talk to your players about?

445
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,530
And what does that mean for you, your players,

446
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,130
and having a sense of spirituality in what you do?

447
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,429
It's a funny one, Luke, because it's sort of one of those ones where you –

448
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,269
like how much do you open yourself up to?

449
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,489
This is a – you know, there's usually the sporting side that you want to hide

450
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,190
and that you – sorry, you're open to, and then there's the other stuff

451
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:53,170
that you are interested in that you're not sure whether to share openly,

452
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:58,130
whereas spirituality is a really different one because there's so many people

453
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:05,909
that either have religious influences there and beliefs or people that don't,

454
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:09,429
but we all have – everybody has a spirituality, you know,

455
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:10,409
and when you think about that,

456
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:17,690
like a spirit, meaning that especially mostly internal,

457
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:24,789
that breath or that feeling of understanding about who you are

458
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,309
and then the shared connection of spirituality,

459
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,309
and that can come out in many ways.

460
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:38,269
So religion has a major part, but also being able to experience things

461
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,269
in different ways, either through –

462
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,329
through breath or through philosophy or through poem or through experience,

463
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:52,409
and it's often seen as the yin part of our life where we're okay to sort of go

464
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:58,210
into the softer side that sort of opens up, yeah,

465
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:05,010
a bit of a deeper understanding on our essence of where we come from

466
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,769
and where that purity comes from because that's what –

467
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:10,409
there's so many layers.

468
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,530
There's so many layers before we get there.

469
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,429
So it's often saying how do you – how do you work towards offering

470
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,909
that to the people around you?

471
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:23,690
And usually we start with our partner or our kids and then you sort

472
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,429
of have your close circle of friends, but with your spirituality in any form,

473
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,570
how do you open up that wider and wider and what methods do you use?

474
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,650
And it's – yeah, it's a bit of a life's work and trying to do that

475
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,650
in a footy club has become –

476
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:47,250
yeah, really, yeah, it's become a fundamental part of how we try

477
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,449
and go about it, and different people have different experiences

478
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,190
and that's cool.

479
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,550
It's okay, but understand that that's a big part of our connection

480
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,630
in what we can offer to everybody around us.

481
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:03,929
I love the contrast.

482
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,170
You're training athletes in one of the most brutal sports

483
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,789
in the world effectively, you know, to spill blood.

484
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:16,050
On the field and it happens regularly in the amazing intensity of NRL,

485
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:19,849
but at the same time, you know, the heart and the softness

486
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:21,010
at the same time, it's a –

487
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,170
You would have found that though with, you know, the teams that you play with

488
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,389
because this is – you know, when I talk about that, it seems like a –

489
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,110
it seems a bit airy-fairy, right?

490
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,469
So it's something that is a bit weird to go into, but, you know,

491
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:39,409
the best teams that you've played in,

492
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:43,489
there was an emotional bond or connection with those players that I mentioned.

493
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:44,690
100%.

494
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,269
I couldn't agree with you more.

495
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,309
I just love that we're openly talking about it now as a –

496
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,989
you know, I say new generation coach.

497
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,590
You've been doing that for a long while.

498
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,070
The best people in my life were exactly that,

499
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:59,409
and those connections and friendships to me is the best part of sport.

500
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,409
When you do open yourself up and you do break down, you know, that level,

501
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,050
as you described it so well, isn't it?

502
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,130
You maybe start with your partner and your wife and then you really truly drop

503
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,349
all of the facade amongst your friends.

504
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:14,329
You end up with these lifelong friendships in sport.

505
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:18,610
So I love that it's come to where you are now, where it's talked openly about,

506
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,989
and it seems to me the Roosters are a destination for people wanting to be

507
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,050
in that sort of environment from what I can see.

508
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,989
Well, that's – I mean, this is the part of it, right?

509
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,710
Because it always felt like it's a bit soft to talk about it in a brutal sport.

510
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:39,010
But the more work we've done is, you know, that's what warrior cultures are about.

511
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,010
Like, they've understood.

512
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,070
They've understood.

513
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,110
They've understood.

514
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:45,989
There's a Trojan warrior that used to talk about – it's written around how he would

515
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:49,070
spill blood in the morning and carry his baby in the afternoon.

516
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,329
And what's more of an ultimate warrior than that?

517
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,030
And so we talk about sport and we want to see the warrior on the field,

518
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,769
but you have to balance that off the field.

519
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,889
You know, the samurai used to talk about how they would, you know, swords –

520
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:09,250
the swordsmen that they were and they used to defend their clans,

521
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,070
but they also –

522
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:16,809
they used to have the imbalance of doing poetry or painting to balance out their sides

523
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,969
because they understood that they – that's how a warrior was.

524
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:23,909
And so there's no difference in our walk through life.

525
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,730
We've got to balance the two and that's – I guess that's what I'm talking about there

526
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,949
is being open to talking about both sides.

527
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:32,710
True.

528
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:33,489
My mind's going.

529
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,829
I've had the great pleasure in this series on this podcast talking to a range of different people

530
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:39,889
and Steve Butoff.

531
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,550
Steve Butoff comes to mind.

532
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,969
He's the author of – you know, sold over 4 million books in Australia on raising kids

533
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,070
and his book Raising Boys is one of the best-selling books.

534
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,590
You would have heard of Steve and he speaks about being in rooms of big theatres

535
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,909
and he presents to big groups and often to females and he asks them a question around

536
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:00,909
what do you want in a man?

537
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,010
What's the ideal man?

538
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:06,550
Which he says is an interesting question and, you know, you start off with the banter,

539
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,869
but he said it comes down to two things really quickly.

540
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:16,369
Females want a male with spine and a big heart and he sort of puts it in those two categories

541
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,050
which I think sums up a little bit of what you're talking about, isn't it?

542
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:23,889
Yeah, and that's, you know, that's our role.

543
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:30,670
Like I say, just coming back to rugby league or our sport, we get men walk in at 17, 18

544
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:38,210
and walk out at 35 and if we're not looking at that part of their life, you know, if we're

545
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,510
not trying to help.

546
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:46,409
If we're not walking the path of that, building that man and then, you know, we're missing

547
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,670
the point of coaching.

548
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:54,170
We've really got to do that and that's, you know, Steve and his books have been really

549
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:00,989
key in how do you, you know, how do you develop yourself and the people around you into being

550
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:02,329
that and there's no difference.

551
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:07,130
That's why I say brutality is really key for the Roosters, how we play.

552
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,769
We have to play a hard style.

553
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:15,710
But the method about getting that across has, it has changed over the years.

554
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:22,190
You know, it's been, it's getting more open and to be honest, the hardness is harder than

555
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,429
ever.

556
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:31,269
It's just the walking the path of a good man off the field is getting a bit clearer.

557
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,650
And what a healthier way to be and, you know, producing great people at the end of their

558
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,750
time in the game.

559
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,710
Dream, we're seeing a number of characteristics.

560
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:43,510
A number of characteristics of leaders like you and the language you use is aligned with

561
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,050
this community we're seeing of 21st century style leadership and a number of dimensions

562
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:53,210
and I'd like to ask you about them and please feel free to expand as you like.

563
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:57,010
But starting with self-leadership as a dimension of leadership, what do you think of when I

564
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,849
talk to you about self-leadership?

565
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:04,650
Well, I think there's often like, am I on a path myself just because I've got a role?

566
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:09,469
Am I thinking that I'm a leader because I've been given a title?

567
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:17,989
And I feel like that self-leadership is, I don't expect to be perfect, but I have to

568
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:22,510
be on a path to getting myself better as a leader.

569
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,829
You know, there's a real responsibility for that.

570
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:35,989
So self-leadership, I feel, is me continuing to, you know, get better and open myself up

571
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:38,730
to more leadership and different leadership methods.

572
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:45,369
And I think you need to lead yourself well first before you can lead others.

573
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,570
Positively impacting others in your environment.

574
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,570
Clearly, that's a passion of yours, just listening to the way you think about coaching young

575
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,110
athletes.

576
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:58,750
What do you actively do about impacting people positively in the environment you work?

577
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:08,989
Well, I think we have our principles that we apply, but I'm sort of, I think treating

578
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,530
them as, seeing them as a person, you know.

579
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:20,289
So I think if you see them as a commodity or as a, you know, as a player with a cap

580
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:22,690
value or whatever, you're missing the point.

581
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,570
So I think authentically seeing them as a person, and that means everybody in the place,

582
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,690
you know, staff and players.

583
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:37,690
I really feel like that's, yeah, that's a big part of seeing them and then coaching

584
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:38,969
the health.

585
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:45,989
I think that's, I think everybody wants to be seen, you know, me included.

586
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,269
Yeah, well said, isn't it?

587
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:50,829
We're finding that in the education space, isn't it?

588
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,030
Listening to the kids about their own learning environment, you know, hearing their voice,

589
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,610
which maybe hasn't been necessarily common in the past.

590
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:02,469
You've created some incredible visions for the environment you're in and had amazing

591
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:03,849
success, as I said off the top.

592
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,710
How do you think about when you create and share a vision?

593
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,969
How do you go about that?

594
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:15,530
So my process towards that is there's sometimes, there's two different ways.

595
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:22,230
I will often brainstorm, always say let's go to the architecture first.

596
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:29,789
You've got to be an architect first and look on a bigger scale and see the whole framework

597
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:36,869
and then you go about building the foundation to create whatever.

598
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:44,510
you want to create um i think it was david walsh who put together the um the great museum in

599
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,409
tasmania talked about iteration but you've got to have a vision and then you've got to iterate that

600
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:58,250
vision over and over and again um and i think that that's you know important i like the idea

601
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:06,250
of a secret as well you know when you're trying to offer a vision probably not um it depends if

602
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:11,969
you're doing the theming at the start of a year then the idea of sometimes you want to spill it

603
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:17,110
out you want to you want to tell everybody what what you're planning but the idea of keeping a

604
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:24,690
secret's really important and then allowing that um it's like um it's like your first kiss you

605
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:32,769
want it to be that that sparks flying you know that first introduction to um the theme you want

606
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,389
it to hit somewhere special inside them so

607
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:42,889
really having a small team if you're working on a theme or a big event keeping that tight and even

608
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:49,969
i won't tell my assistant coaches not because but i want them to feel that excitement of that theme

609
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:58,510
on that night um or a bit like the grand final like i was talking about is um build out the

610
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,550
picture and then have you can have a shared experience when it when it's going to take

611
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,869
multiple people to to execute it it depends

612
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:14,070
yeah it depends on what what um sphere we're in so you might hold something back if you've had a

613
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,670
vision around a season coming up and a theme for the year that there might be a little something

614
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,909
there that you've you've saved for a big final or an occasion that that feels right is that is that

615
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:28,170
how it sort of unfolds for it well definitely throughout the season i'll split the season into

616
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:35,090
certain periods and you'll you'll have something ready that you know that is aligned with the the

617
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,230
team it's not something new it's not something new it's not something new it's not something new

618
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,389
you know it has to be aligned but you hold on to it for certain points throughout the year

619
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:49,050
um definitely the holding of that um yeah the holding of that's really important and putting

620
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:57,230
it in at the right times whether it's periods throughout the year um or um yeah even within a

621
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:05,630
week you know when when do you want to get um you know so a brand new game plan you better get it

622
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:15,190
sunday for a monday you better get that out there um but if it's um an emotional link into a game if

623
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,429
you feel like that's something that we don't always do but it's not much use spilling that

624
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:26,210
energy on a tuesday for a saturday game you know you want to sort of get it closer to thursday

625
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:33,530
friday and have a having a build up to it we're seeing curiosity as a really key thing that

626
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,230
leaders uh like yourself um

627
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,889
are really you know big on and then they approach their learning and improvement often through their

628
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:46,030
their sense of curiosity when i ask you about that dimension of being a leader what what does

629
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,349
that resonate with you the sense of curiosity i think there's two things luke when you when

630
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:57,750
you mention that is curiosity is vital for for continual progression um but

631
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:05,110
i also think you've got to have a foundation if you don't have consistency in your work

632
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,190
like i'm

633
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:16,610
you know i've got new ideas or i'm exciting or whatever but i know that the players will walk

634
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:23,090
in every day knowing that um defense is the most important walking in for now the 10th season

635
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:29,949
um that they will have will play a consistent style of play you know that you have to have

636
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:35,010
consistency about yourself most coaches have to know where home is

637
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,230
so you've got to have consistency about yourself and you've got to have consistency about yourself

638
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:43,730
so you can so curiosity is then put on top of that have a foundation know who you are you've got

639
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:49,210
to have a style that really works and then the curiosity goes on top of that to keep that fresh

640
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:58,489
and new and evolving as well whereas if curiosity makes you jump uh constantly from year to year and

641
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:05,809
change i think we should do this and that um my belief is you won't be successful you have to have

642
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:12,610
um a style of play a style of coaching a style of management and add curiosity

643
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:18,489
on top of that yeah it's an interesting uh way to think about the foundation as being the

644
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:23,730
the uh the essence and the curiosity on top i haven't heard someone describe it that that way

645
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,550
but it makes a lot of sense the way you go about your life and your and your leadership uh

646
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:34,130
communicating with clarity is a common trait of uh of all great leaders how do you think about that

647
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,230
yeah i think your choice of words is really important and i think that's a really important

648
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:45,050
key i think you'll often when you start coaching um you'll work so hard on the presentation and

649
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:50,050
you'll get out what you want to get out but the clarity of words and the use of words is vital

650
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:57,409
you know words have energy so making sure you don't um that you choose carefully the words

651
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:03,949
that you use on on your presentation and as i said um you might want to present in a certain way

652
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:06,230
um but ask for the words that you want to present in a certain way

653
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:13,289
are they going to hear those words um and i feel like the clarity of message um as i said i might

654
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:22,989
want to be um really uh curious or really vision focused and all of that but our players need the

655
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:29,190
fundamentals they need to be you know they need to walk in every day and um work really hard on

656
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:34,929
building principles before we get to the funky stuff um and so you've got to hold you cool and

657
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:36,230
understand what you're doing and what you're doing and what you're doing and what you're doing

658
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:43,090
what message you're getting across because if you know if i say five things that are principle

659
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:50,409
driven and then one thing that is um exciting and and funky then that's the one i need to

660
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:57,869
i need to be sent saying 20 30 things that are principle driven in early stages of building a

661
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:05,130
team and then sprinkle in the the funky stuff on top of that and it depends what team you got

662
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,130
you know i've just

663
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:12,210
we've just um moved out a lot of leaders that had a lot of principles in them and we're reforming

664
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:17,070
that um so that's really key in what we're trying to do at the moment and that's why i'm speaking

665
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:24,070
that way is i've got to hold myself back from the fun stuff and and constantly go over principles

666
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:29,530
and fundamentals over and over and over again because that's what the house will be built on

667
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,110
yeah it's interesting just to hear how systematic and thought out you are on

668
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,190
on that process no mistake at all in in in your

669
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:41,730
language and how you use it uh collaboration we're seeing is a real trait of uh of great

670
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,570
leadership as we see it at the moment how important is collaboration for you yeah i think

671
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:52,010
when you say collaboration luke are you talking about within the sport are you talking about

672
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:59,409
outside of the sport where do you probably that shift away from hierarchy and one person being

673
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:05,989
the voice to we're seeing leaders now understanding that that the shared voice and using people around

674
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,989
you and and you know probably your example of actually listening to your own playing group

675
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:15,630
and making decisions based on that collaboration and probably even the collaboration you're doing

676
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,530
in your own learning outside of it it seems like it's something you do effortlessly yeah i think the

677
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:27,829
the first one the collaboration within the group um we just had a big change over in in physical

678
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:34,210
performance stuff i have dave missen come back he's been in afl for a long time and um we've

679
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,230
been in a consistent form of training and we've been in a consistent form of training and we've

680
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,090
been in a consistent form of training and we've been in a consistent form of training for a while

681
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:43,690
so it's been interesting in saying my learnings on that about well how do you throw everything out

682
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:52,110
and then um everybody co-create a new model um and so that's been really it's been a good learning

683
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:59,809
for me about collaboration and and how you have to allow space for everybody to have a choice

684
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,630
and then you then everybody will buy into the program a bit like we talked about earlier in

685
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,949
the podcast about um

686
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:13,489
um the grand final week you know that and it's hard you know it's not i'm not saying it's easy

687
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:20,510
me at my worst in coaching i want to go in and control um that environment and it's really common

688
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:26,590
for coaches so i said when you get that role you want to go in and go no no i want to do it this way

689
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:34,230
and sometimes you have to but not when it's when the you have to do when it's right not because

690
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,150
you're feeling

691
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,610
like you're losing control when you collaborate um and i know that's you know i'm having to work

692
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:48,380
on that constantly i feel like when you sit in a meeting and you're running it eventually

693
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:54,559
it just it doesn't feel as good when you sit back and everybody's running that meeting you

694
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:01,980
have an agenda but everybody's got a voice and i feel like that's you know for me that's when i'm

695
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,199
at my best and at my worst there's there's two different styles of of

696
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:14,659
leadership and um so i think that's such an important um part of coaching and sharing

697
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:19,559
we heard brian gorge and speak to us really openly um the australian basketball coach incredible

698
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,480
experience at the olympics and turning up he's had amazing success as you would know he's 67

699
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,739
years of age i think gorge he turns up at the olympics and he's got two leaders in

700
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:34,360
patty mills and joe ingles who have absolutely clearly set out the tone for what they want to

701
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,659
achieve at the olympics and you know he had to really listen and and

702
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:43,079
uh and understand he just was this gift of two people who were really going to set the tone and

703
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,940
you know for him at his age to be able to uh adapt to that and understand that that was such a

704
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:53,039
powerful asset that took them to their first ever olympic medal was it was a great story and a you

705
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,360
know probably a great story of uh self-reflection but also the collaboration to see the leadership

706
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,059
that he had before him it was incredible yeah i mean i mean brian i've never met brian but just

707
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:07,800
the the way that he continually comes back and and you can see

708
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:13,659
that players everywhere he's been that players continually play um for him and he's got a really

709
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:19,800
um that's i feel like he's a really good example of someone that you know is a head coach he's got

710
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:28,179
the presence of a head coach but he's never um suffocated his teams you always feel like his

711
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:34,980
teams are um are a team and a collective that he's a part of that team from a distance that's

712
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,800
um it's been incredible to watch him over decades

713
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:43,659
um and now i think i feel like that's you know the the best coaches that i've seen are those ones

714
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:50,340
that um are the head coach because that's the role that they're in but there is this shared

715
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:57,280
responsibility throughout the teams and the head coach knows when to to step in and um and be that

716
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,099
role because the players need it you know they need the head coach to look after that at this

717
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,659
time but the then the coach pulls out and allows patty mills to you know

718
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:13,739
to do something special you know and he allow him to be the ultimate leader of that olympic

719
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:18,679
campaign there's a brilliant uh brilliant story and uh beautifully summed up through your insight

720
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:24,000
about asking all these leaders final two questions uh trent i've been time to think if you need it but

721
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,860
the first one is um if you look back at your life who's been the greatest leader in your life

722
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:37,500
greatest you know i always go back to um my mum has always been

723
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:46,199
you know she was a teacher from when i was a young age um and she showed me uh the strength

724
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:54,360
of uh teaching you know she was disciplined but really caring um at the same time and i feel like

725
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:03,460
that um really you know i really enjoyed watching mum teach um um when i was a youngster and that

726
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,960
that was the greatest leadership i had in in sort of

727
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:13,780
teaching and if you could collaborate with anyone firstly i love hearing that isn't it close to home

728
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:19,940
and to hear from your mother and i i read that uh further education was a given in the robinson

729
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,760
household for that you that was just going to happen and you know you've got the science degree

730
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,719
as as the older brother dean as well so i'm not surprised it's great to hear that uh before i

731
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:34,119
move on that collaboration we mentioned is a key thing that we're really passionate about

732
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:37,400
trent asking this question if you could collaborate with anyone in the world

733
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:47,900
who would it be phil jackson i would absolutely love to um you know he's i've read all his books

734
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:56,739
um uh in in coaching and i i just love the way that he went about the art of the game and then

735
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:03,219
the art of the dressing room you know i just um and he had a big spiritual side to the way that

736
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:07,800
he coached as well and he felt um open to to offer that to people and i think that's a really good

737
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:07,840
thing to do and i think that's a really good thing to do and i think that's a really good thing to do

738
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,059
to his players and and they were really non-judgmental in the way that he did that

739
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:21,760
but i just he he he was sort of the first one that um allowed through his books allowed me to be the

740
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,739
coach that i wanted to be yeah wouldn't that be brilliant to uh to connect if you've ever been in

741
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:31,659
a room with him if you had the chance to it's pretty accessible world did you i'm assuming you

742
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:36,800
would have uh as everyone did love the the last dance documentary and we we got an insight into

743
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,900
but a lot of phil jackson in that time as well yeah it was sort of quite i mean it was very

744
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:49,039
plagiarism which we loved and it was quite subtle on on on phil's role but understanding you know

745
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:56,019
the way that he did dance between the different players but um some of the you know sacred hoops

746
00:58:56,019 --> 00:59:05,039
you know amazing book on on how spirituality and sport came into his coaching um and even

747
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,619
some of his sort of his early books but he he um

748
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:14,179
yeah it was just um he did have lots of fights with the front office that was one of his strengths

749
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:20,480
as a coach which um but yeah the understanding of the court and the way to play and then also

750
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,699
the dressing room uh he was an artist uh it's been a great honor and a great privilege uh to

751
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:31,139
meet you first of all to get understanding of what you do for the people in your environment

752
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:35,539
there's so many great lessons i've got a couple hours worth of more questions but in the interest

753
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,659
of your time uh i'll leave it there

754
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,320
thanks so much we've loved the fact we've been able to connect with you and see the influence

755
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,239
