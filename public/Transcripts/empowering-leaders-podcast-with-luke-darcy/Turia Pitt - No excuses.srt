1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,919
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,179
Terea Pitt is one of Australia's most remarkable people.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,960
If you don't know her story, we hear it from Terea herself.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:18,120
But it is incredible, a story of overcoming the most immense of challenges,

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,480
both physically and mentally.

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,460
This chat for me was truly unique and there are so many takeaways from the conversation.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,039
But for those listening and for myself, you'll hear in the conversation

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,420
some really practical learnings Terea offers that we can apply to our day-to-day life.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,020
Terea's work ethic, incredible resilience ties in with the passion that we have

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,840
at our organisation Alita.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,420
It was founded with my great friend Matt Waterwitz,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,000
a space where incredible leaders come together to collaborate and learn

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,259
and open up about how they're leading in their world.

14
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,299
If you're interested in this space, you can find it at alitacollective.com.

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,479
We'd encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program

16
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:00,100
to get started and to understand how, like Terea, you're leading in your world.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,299
Terea Pitt.

18
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,519
Had completed a Bachelor of Engineering, landed her dream job,

19
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,560
was building a career in modelling as well as being an ultramarathon runner.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,280
In September 2011, her life would change forever while competing in an ultramarathon event

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,159
on Equestro Station in the East Kimberley region of Australia.

22
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,540
An out-of-control fire surrounded her.

23
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,420
She sustained burns to 65% of her body, losing the fingers and thumb on her right hand,

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,599
enduring more than 200 surgeries over six months in hospital

25
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,280
that would ultimately save her life.

26
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:48,700
In the more than decades since, Terea has inspired millions of people around the world.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,540
She's now a proud mother of two, a best-selling author of three books.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,120
She's competed in the Ironman World Championship a couple of times,

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,260
despite having been told that she would never run again.

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,959
She's an in-demand motivational speaker, a successful entrepreneur,

31
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,359
and the host of a brilliant podcast titled Terea Pitt is Hard Work.

32
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,719
Tough title, that one, but it is brilliant.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,639
I urge you to check it out.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,300
It's great to catch up with you, Terea.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
It's a remarkable life that you live.

36
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,280
Thanks for taking the time.

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,900
Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Luke.

38
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,860
I appreciate it.

39
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,120
Terea, I wanted to start with your podcast.

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,120
I love it.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
It is brilliant, like everything that you do.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,099
As I said, Terea Pitt is hard work.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
I encourage you to check it out.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,439
But I wanted to discuss, in particular, the episode you did with Kate Sanderson,

45
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,539
your fellow ultramarathon runner, who was severely burnt alongside you in that fire in the Kimber.

46
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,840
It is an incredible interview.

47
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,300
They all are on your podcast.

48
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,860
But you catch up with her.

49
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,520
I think nearly 10 years after the accident.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,919
And amazingly, it's the first time the two of you have discussed what happened on that day

51
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,460
from both of your perspectives.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,360
It is just amazing to listen to.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,300
Are you okay going back talking about that?

54
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,159
Or is it something you're trying to avoid these days?

55
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:02,180
No.

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,740
Well, I guess that's, I've got to think about, that's why most people know me, right?

57
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,840
Because I went through that horrific experience.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,460
So, it makes sense that people are interested in it and intrigued by it.

59
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,919
And to listen to that, sorry to cut you off, Terea.

60
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,360
No, no, no.

61
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,159
I'm full of questions.

62
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,379
You're running the show.

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,360
You're running the show today.

64
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,199
Look, it's all good.

65
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,240
I've got so much I want to get through.

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,139
It is, I mean, all your interviews are brilliant on the podcast.

67
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,560
But I was fascinated to some of the detail in that interview.

68
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,379
Kate talked about remembering you jogging past her.

69
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,479
And she looked and said, that's a good looking girl.

70
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,280
Well, you know.

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
And you two had that exchange.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,719
And then you almost apologised to Kate and said, I've taken this very public path in my life.

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,300
And she's been incredibly private about it.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,699
That was a fascinating exchange.

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,539
Was there some sense of guilt for you and, you know, being very different about how you've approached it post that event?

76
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,379
No, I think it's just an illustration of how different we all are.

77
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,259
So, for me, being public with my story, putting it out there on an open stage.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,639
I found it helpful.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,039
I found it motivating.

80
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:17,800
In a sense, I felt it made me accountable with my recovery.

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,439
So, when I was doing my rehab or when I was with the physio or when I was training for the Ironman,

82
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,480
having everyone know about those experiences or know about what I was planning to do

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,740
and people stopping me on the street and saying, you know, like, how's the training coming along for the Ironman?

84
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,439
I felt like I was accountable to all of Australia.

85
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,600
And even though at times I'd think, far out.

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,259
Why did I tell them?

87
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,639
Well, everyone, that I was, that I'm, you know, that I'm doing these things or that I'm doing this stupid race or

88
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,379
I think it definitely helped me with my recovery.

89
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,800
But as you heard in the interview, Kate is the complete opposite of me.

90
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,639
She's very private.

91
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,699
But she's still done tremendously well.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,819
Like she's, she did a 250 kilometre ultra marathon through the Sahara Desert, which is totally nuts.

93
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,819
Considering that, you know, she's burnt to 60%.

94
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,220
She's burnt to 60% of her body as well.

95
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,819
So she has trouble regulating her body temperature as well.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,980
And she lost half her foot in the fire.

97
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,199
So like, that's just, you know, I think she's way more hardcore than me, to be honest.

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,819
And if you listen to that interview, as I said, it's a really moving thing to hear the two of you sit down and talk about it.

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,160
And as you said, Kate lost her foot.

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,740
She's quietly gone about her well.

101
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,019
But she's totally, you know, as you said, we're all different.

102
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,699
We all approach things differently.

103
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,019
And she's...

104
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,860
Of course, an enormous, you can feel the bond that you two have for life.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,899
And you even said at one stage, I was really pissed off you got in the chopper first, you know, so...

106
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,199
I was so pissed off.

107
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:52,699
I was so pissed off because like I was in, I was in pain.

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I wanted to just get the hell out of there.

109
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,300
We'd been stuck on that hill for four hours.

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I wasn't quite lucid.

111
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,980
But when Kate was in the helicopter first, I was like, oh, come on.

112
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,600
Like I'm awesome.

113
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,060
I'm so really badly hurt right now as well.

114
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,720
It's an amazing conversation to hear.

115
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:23,139
Can I ask you, how hard was it to move past the anger initially that, you know, should that event even have taken place?

116
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,699
There was 30 grass fires burning around the Kimberley region.

117
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,600
Why did the organisers allow that to happen?

118
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,740
How was there four hours delay before you actually got held by...

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,079
That must have been a huge amount of anger attached to that.

120
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,079
Was that hard to move past that?

121
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah, look, initially it was.

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,040
And I think for anyone that's had a life-changing experience like mine,

123
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,959
there's always that element where you say, why me?

124
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,199
Or why did this happen?

125
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:58,860
Or, you know, you're thinking about all of the different ways that you ended up in that time and that place.

126
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,839
But at the same time, Luke, like I'm an engineer.

127
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm quite a logical, practical, rational person.

128
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,139
And I've just thought throughout my journey,

129
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,399
like it doesn't really help.

130
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,620
Like getting angry, getting pissed off, getting annoyed, getting bitter

131
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,379
doesn't do anything for me or for my recovery.

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,699
It doesn't help me run faster.

133
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,500
It doesn't help my relationship with my husband.

134
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,420
It doesn't help me to be a better mum.

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,079
It doesn't help me with my job right now.

136
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,339
So I've kind of like accepted that anger in my life.

137
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,620
And I think it's perfectly normal and really understandable

138
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,639
to be angry about something that's happened to you.

139
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,860
But also, it doesn't...

140
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,560
It doesn't do anything for me to sit in that place of anger

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,519
or sit in that place of being bitter.

142
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,699
And I'm really proud of myself

143
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,399
because I think the way I've reinvented myself

144
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,240
and the life I live now is pretty amazing.

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,480
And, you know, I live this great life with my wonderful husband

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,399
and my beautiful kids.

147
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,040
And I feel really proud of what I've done

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,720
and what I've achieved as well.

149
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,720
And I think Kate feels the same too.

150
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,879
Yeah, she sounds equally remarkable, Kate.

151
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,199
And as you said, different paths.

152
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,980
But you can feel the strength

153
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,259
when you hear that interview on your podcast.

154
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,459
Your latest book, and I want to come back to this,

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,540
Happy and Other Ridiculous Aspirations.

156
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,540
I did want to pick up on, as you just said then,

157
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,339
so articulately that, you know,

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,399
we all experience those emotions, don't we?

159
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,860
And we all have anger for certain things.

160
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,579
Yours probably more justified

161
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,199
than maybe anyone else on the planet.

162
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,059
But if you linger there,

163
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,100
you're really not going to find happiness.

164
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,200
And you've written a whole book

165
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,679
and it's a brilliant book as well.

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,659
To be able to understand those emotions, Thierry,

167
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,399
and deal with them

168
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,440
is a pretty profound bit of wisdom, isn't it?

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,779
Yeah, look, I don't know if I would say

170
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,139
I'm the wisest person out there.

171
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,279
I don't think I am,

172
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,700
but it was just probably just realising

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,960
through my journey that, you know,

174
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,899
we all know how we feel when we feel angry.

175
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,019
It's not a very comfortable emotion for us to feel,

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,460
but it is also just another emotion.

177
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,820
So just like feeling happy and excited,

178
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,700
and energised and enthusiastic,

179
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,340
those are all really positive emotions.

180
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,779
Those emotions all feel really good.

181
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,419
And so it makes sense that we'd prefer to be happy

182
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,100
and excited and enthusiastic all of the time.

183
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,700
But life just doesn't work that way, right?

184
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,919
So just as we have some days where we feel happy,

185
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,799
frothing, can't wait to get stuck into what we're doing,

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,480
looking forward to a great holiday we've got coming up,

187
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,100
we also have the other side.

188
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,200
We might be pissed off at our boss

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,779
because they've asked us to do extra work,

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
we might have a fight with our partner

191
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,740
about something that's mundane, about doing the dishes.

192
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,779
We might be angry at our kids

193
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,620
because they're not listening to us.

194
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,659
So we do feel all of those emotions all of the time.

195
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,600
And so I do think that we've got this culture

196
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,399
of toxic positivity these days.

197
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,620
And it's almost like we don't let ourselves be sad

198
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,279
or be annoyed or be stressed or be irritated.

199
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,840
We've always got to, you know,

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,440
find the silver lining or look on the bright side

201
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,500
or pick ourselves back up or whatever it is.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,240
And I think that we're doing ourselves a disservice

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,879
because I think feeling angry or sad,

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,820
they are real emotions that we feel.

205
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,419
And I think just by accepting them and acknowledging them

206
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,059
and letting them pass over us,

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,919
I think that's more empowering

208
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,259
rather than just bullshitting to ourselves and saying,

209
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,460
no, no, no, no, no, I'm all good, I'm all good,

210
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,799
everything is good, everything is good.

211
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,779
You know?

212
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,940
It makes huge sense to me, Terea,

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
and I think you're right.

214
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,360
You feel that need to try and put that mask on.

215
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,179
A lot of people do.

216
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,799
And even anger, I know playing sport,

217
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,480
anger was a pretty useful emotion,

218
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,379
playing a competitive sport and also...

219
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,360
For sure, for sure.

220
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,259
It would have been incredibly useful for you.

221
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,120
Incredibly useful.

222
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,320
Not so useful sometimes around the kids.

223
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,019
But it's as you said, you know,

224
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,059
if someone's breaking through the door of our house,

225
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:08,720
you want to find them.

226
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:08,820
You want to find them.

227
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,200
You want to find your anger again pretty quickly.

228
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,299
It's not as though, you know,

229
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,799
an absence of that is a good thing.

230
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
So you're right.

231
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,340
There's that guilt associated with it sometimes, isn't it?

232
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,620
It's the understanding that they are just emotions

233
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,679
and when you can be real and acknowledge them,

234
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,679
there's an opportunity to live a more productive

235
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,460
and happy life.

236
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,320
I think you sum it up beautifully.

237
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,899
Yeah, and just, yeah, acknowledge them

238
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,480
and just allow yourself to sit in that emotion,

239
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,679
even though it's not comfortable,

240
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,220
even though no one likes feeling angry or jealous

241
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,720
or irritated.

242
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,500
They're not irritated or envious.

243
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,360
They are just emotions

244
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,879
and emotions change all of the time.

245
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,279
And we all feel them, don't we?

246
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,860
Even if you're not a jealous person,

247
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,419
everyone understands what jealousy feels like.

248
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,620
It's just, it's there

249
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,679
and when you can get in touch with that,

250
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,279
you know, reading your work,

251
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,960
it's something that you articulate incredibly well.

252
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,279
I look back at you, Therese, a 23-year-old,

253
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,360
you're a serious achiever.

254
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,519
You know, you've completed an engineering degree.

255
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,299
You've got your dream job.

256
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,179
You've got a great partner.

257
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,419
You're running ultra marathons

258
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:13,200
and then you have this unimaginable hardship

259
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,480
that people like me,

260
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,620
we can't even pretend to know what that was like for you.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,919
Is it possible to think that even post that,

262
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,940
that you're an even better version of yourself

263
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,779
or is that condescending to say,

264
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,600
or is it just that you've channeled that same inner strength

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,720
in a slightly different path because of that hardship?

266
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,419
Yeah, it's a tricky question to unpack.

267
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,399
I don't know if I am a better person necessarily,

268
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,000
but I do think out of everything,

269
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,679
like if I had one regret,

270
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,399
it would be that before the fight,

271
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,320
I had all of these amazing people in my life.

272
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,860
I had this amazing boyfriend, right?

273
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,019
And I thought he was great,

274
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,379
but I was just like, you know, my family,

275
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,759
they were amazing as well.

276
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,460
I thought they were great,

277
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,059
but I didn't really think that much more about it.

278
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,039
And, you know,

279
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,039
I've got to temper this by saying I was a young woman.

280
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,379
I was 24 years old.

281
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:18,179
Young people by nature are maybe a little more self-absorbed.

282
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,320
I think with age comes a bit more wisdom

283
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,559
and being a parent as well,

284
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,440
you realise that your world doesn't revolve around you anymore

285
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,659
and it's more about your family.

286
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,539
So, but I think as a young person,

287
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,340
I had all of these amazing people in my life.

288
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,820
I had all of these things going for me,

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,639
but I never took a moment to let those people know

290
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,879
how much I appreciated them,

291
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,700
how much I was grateful for them,

292
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,259
how much their support and love and encouragement

293
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,980
meant the world to me.

294
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,019
Because I think I was definitely an overachiever.

295
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,460
I still am today.

296
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,259
But the only way I was able to do that

297
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,159
was because I had all of these things going for me.

298
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,259
I had great parents who gave me a solid foundation

299
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,940
who, when I said I want to do this thing,

300
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,240
they were encouraging and supportive.

301
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,120
I had a great guy next to me who was my rock.

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,639
I had amazing friends who were fun

303
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,899
and encouraging and supportive.

304
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,419
And I think, and you would know this, Luke,

305
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,980
you know, with team sports,

306
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,759
the only way that you get to achieve

307
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,519
whatever it is in the sport

308
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,399
is by having those people around you

309
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,940
who help you and help you achieve the vision,

310
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,820
I guess, that you're going after.

311
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,539
So if I have one regret,

312
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,460
it would be that I never told the people in my life

313
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,519
how much they meant to me

314
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,100
before I had this.

315
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,620
This hardship.

316
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,299
And do you do that more now?

317
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Way more now.

318
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:43,960
Way more.

319
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,700
I'm probably too much the other way.

320
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,940
But I think it's so important, right?

321
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,820
Because, you know, it's our relationships with each other

322
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,740
that really matter when it comes down to the wire.

323
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,779
Yeah, absolutely.

324
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,899
It's, again, there's so much wisdom in your words

325
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,399
and in reading and listening to your podcast

326
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,779
in preparation for today,

327
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,019
there's some of your words,

328
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,519
but I just felt compelled to read back to you.

329
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,080
And this particular quote stands out for me.

330
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:12,960
If I've learned anything,

331
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,320
it's that we are all much stronger

332
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,379
and more powerful than we'll ever know.

333
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm trapped by my body,

334
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,840
but others are trapped by their attitude.

335
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,080
And I think that is a worse tragedy.

336
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,240
Can you describe that incredible attitude that you have

337
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,620
and how it served you so well?

338
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,019
Oh, no, that is a very hard,

339
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,879
that is a really hard question to answer.

340
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,919
Well, I guess I've got a can-do approach to life.

341
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,279
I have the attitude that just give something a go.

342
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,419
Doesn't matter if you're shit at it.

343
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,039
If you keep trying, you'll get better.

344
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,899
Just show up.

345
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,919
You don't have to do things perfectly the first time,

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,860
but if you keep showing up, you will improve.

347
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,679
And I think that open mindset

348
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,460
or that willingness to test yourself,

349
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,340
that willingness to fail at things,

350
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,720
that willingness to do things,

351
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,840
that willingness to fail at things,

352
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:06,860
that willingness to do things,

353
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,259
that willingness to do something,

354
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
even if you're not particularly good at it,

355
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,659
I think all of those are really great qualities.

356
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,100
They're qualities that I got

357
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,419
or that were instilled in me by my parents

358
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,899
and they're the qualities I try to instill in my kids.

359
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,659
And you think, you know, if you look at little kids,

360
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,279
they're so willing to try things for the first time,

361
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,799
you know, walking, running, soccer, whatever it is they try,

362
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,299
they might be really average at it to start with,

363
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,919
but they know that if they just keep trying

364
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,700
or if they persist, they'll get better.

365
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,820
But I think as adults, you know,

366
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,299
you try something for the first time

367
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,720
and surprise, surprise, you're shit at it.

368
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,860
And what do you say to yourself?

369
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,279
You just say, oh, I'm shit at soccer.

370
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,799
I'm not good at this.

371
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,340
I'm not going to try it again.

372
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,539
I'm terrible at IT.

373
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,279
I can't operate my computer.

374
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,759
I can't do all these things.

375
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,480
They're all coming to me straight away, Terea,

376
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,100
but you're right.

377
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,279
It's that persistence that springs to mind.

378
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,200
I also wanted to pick up,

379
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,980
and I was just, as I read that quote,

380
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,019
I was thinking I had the great pleasure to sit down

381
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:05,640
with Dr. Terea,

382
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,559
who did the National Pallet Party,

383
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,299
who had a serious motor accident,

384
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,420
ended up in a wheelchair

385
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,180
and was the first doctor to actually be able

386
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,900
to complete a medical degree from a wheelchair

387
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,059
and with the serious injuries that he sustained.

388
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,579
And he talked about when he was a young lawyer

389
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,200
getting depressed because he was doing law

390
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,099
because he really felt like that was what the family

391
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:29,619
wanted him to do.

392
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,019
He wasn't living what he should be.

393
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,319
And his words to me when I spoke to him,

394
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,619
that was much more debilitating.

395
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,680
Being in that mindset than being in a wheelchair

396
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,619
and that your power of your mind is so much more

397
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:47,140
to overcome than even the most challenging physical

398
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,240
challenges we face.

399
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,019
Does that resonate?

400
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,960
Yeah, it does.

401
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,619
And I also think with the language that we use

402
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,299
with overcoming hardships, right?

403
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:02,079
It's like I have to beat this thing.

404
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,680
I have to rise above it.

405
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,180
I have to overcome it.

406
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:11,859
That language to me, it sounds really intimidating

407
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:17,759
because for me, I don't really think like I've smashed

408
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,539
my recovery or I've beaten down this hardship

409
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,559
with a big stick.

410
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,940
Rather than that, if I have hard days, I accept them.

411
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,460
I remind myself that I get to do,

412
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,880
you know, I've got a great job.

413
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,220
I get to speak to interesting people like you, Luke.

414
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,680
I get to write really great books that people want to read.

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,420
I get to teach women how to run in my running program.

416
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,940
So I live this really great life.

417
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,420
But I think it's not, for me, it's not so black and white.

418
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,000
It's not like I reached this turning point where I was like,

419
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,119
whoa, I've done it.

420
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,940
I've overcome my adversity now.

421
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,880
And now it's, you know, now I don't have to think about it anymore.

422
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,519
It's more just something.

423
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,980
It's something that I live with, which is what anyone would say, right?

424
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,799
So like I forgot that doctor's name who you spoke to.

425
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,880
Dinesh Pellopani.

426
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,220
So his injuries would be something that he lives with on a daily basis.

427
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,700
Same with my injuries.

428
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,279
And equally, if you lose someone that you love,

429
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,359
if your partner's going through a battle with cancer,

430
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,859
it's all things that we live with.

431
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,079
And so rather than, you know, I don't want the audience

432
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,279
to walk away thinking, oh, well,

433
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:34,500
if I don't have a doctor, I don't know what I'm going to do.

434
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,359
If I have an accident, I'll reach a point

435
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,940
where I'll just magically be over it

436
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,599
and then I'll get to continue living my life as normal.

437
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,700
I think it's something that you learn to live with.

438
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,720
But also you can have a really great life with it as well.

439
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,380
Yeah, beautifully, beautifully said.

440
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,480
I mean, it's the essence of what you're delving into in the podcast.

441
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:57,839
Sharia Pitt is hard work.

442
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,980
I love the title.

443
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,420
Do you though?

444
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,339
Do you though?

445
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,480
Well, it sort of catches you off guard.

446
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,940
It does, doesn't it?

447
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,839
You're going, you know, what does that actually mean?

448
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,740
But I think when you jump in and you are talking to people

449
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,180
that have experienced, you know, hardship and challenge

450
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,880
with the idea of learning, you know, what the lessons are from it,

451
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,039
can you share with us what have you found so far

452
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,519
from those that have been able to overcome hardship?

453
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,799
As I said, that language I'm using, which, as you said,

454
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,640
it's not a magical formula and it's overcome,

455
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,740
but is there some patterns that you're finding?

456
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,019
You know, I think the thing that I found after speaking to the guests

457
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,019
that I've had, and I've had some really amazing guests.

458
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,079
I've had Dr. Charlie Teo, Kurt Fearnley.

459
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,640
I just spoke to Richard Harris, who was the anaesthetist

460
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,119
who helped rescue the boys in the cave in Thailand.

461
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,380
So I think the commonality between all of those people is to start with

462
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,859
they really enjoyed what they did for work.

463
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,420
And I think this was part of that episode that you spoke to with Russell, right?

464
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,480
Because you asked him about work.

465
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,359
He said work-life balance, and he said there's...

466
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:06,920
It's bullshit.

467
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,019
He said Russell Howcroft you're talking about,

468
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:14,019
who's a legendary figure and co-host of The Gruen.

469
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:17,740
And, yeah, he said work-life balance doesn't exist was his answer, wasn't it?

470
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,140
Yeah, because he said that's just like you go to work and you don't like it.

471
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,900
And then as soon as you clock off, it's like, whoa, now I can start living.

472
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,660
But he, you know, he obviously loves his work.

473
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,220
And I think that's been the commonality between everyone I've spoken to.

474
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,339
They all have something really positive.

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,480
That they're channeling their focus or channeling their energy into.

476
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:46,059
And another commonality I've found is that they all still do experience those harder times

477
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:51,420
or those hard days, but they don't let themselves become floored by it.

478
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,059
So they may have a shitty day, but they all have the presence of mind

479
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,599
to realize that it's just a day.

480
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,819
And in the broader context, they do enjoy their lives,

481
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,880
but that's not to say that they don't occasionally

482
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,140
have bad days.

483
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,279
And I think that's really important.

484
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,099
That ties back into what I was saying before.

485
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,259
You don't reach this point where you suddenly transform into this mythical being

486
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:18,059
and you no longer feel sad or angry anymore.

487
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,519
It doesn't quite work like that.

488
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,339
But I love, and sometimes it does sound cliche, Turia,

489
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,859
when you hear people, you know, follow your purpose and find your passion.

490
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:29,480
But the cliches actually often make sense, don't they?

491
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,859
Because, you know, I look at you and I just see purpose and I see passion.

492
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,460
And in every chapter of your life, and I think one of the saddest things

493
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,299
is when you see people, you know, trapped in their own mind,

494
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,319
in a job they hate or in a relationship they hate

495
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,279
or in a life they don't like, when it is hard,

496
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,519
but there are choices, aren't there?

497
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,359
You can always change your paradigm with, you know, with purpose.

498
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:52,640
Yeah.

499
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah, look, I think most of us can.

500
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,940
I think for some, I know there's some people out there

501
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,099
who might not have the privileges or the opportunities

502
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,819
that we've both had.

503
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,480
So, you know, I don't think everyone is in that position

504
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,000
where they do have that clear choice.

505
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:12,980
But I agree with you.

506
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:17,240
If you find something that you enjoy doing, whatever it is,

507
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,079
and you feel like going to work isn't a grind for you

508
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,380
and it's something that you enjoy doing and that you, you know,

509
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,500
dare I say you love, I think that's really great

510
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,279
and you're really lucky.

511
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,440
And if you're not enjoying what you're doing right now,

512
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
maybe there's some extra study you could do.

513
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:33,839
Maybe.

514
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,839
Maybe there's some extra training.

515
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,880
Maybe you could just back yourself or challenge yourself

516
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,079
and take that leap and have that little bit of faith in yourself

517
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,200
to try and find another, I guess, another vocation

518
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,180
that you might prefer.

519
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,119
Turi, your latest book, and they're all bestsellers

520
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,059
and brilliant, Happy and Other Ridiculous Aspirations

521
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,500
is the title.

522
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,579
It's another brilliant bit of work from you explores

523
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:58,960
can you actually get happier?

524
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
I wanted to ask you the daily routines, there's a chapter on it,

525
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,220
and the habits, the stuff that you do to try and be happier

526
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,900
and live a happier life.

527
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,299
Can you share with us some of the things that work for you?

528
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,839
Yeah, so there's a couple of different things.

529
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,240
I think to start with, it's easier to be happy

530
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,579
if we're doing the basics, right?

531
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,480
If we're eating well, if we're moving our body,

532
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,779
if we're getting enough sleep,

533
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,920
if you've got those three things down pat,

534
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,140
it's going to be easier for you to be happier, right?

535
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:32,920
And those three things,

536
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,680
they sound really simple,

537
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,900
but it's so easy for us to come out of whack with them.

538
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,740
We might be stressed, might have taken on a lot at work.

539
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,880
We might have just eaten, like not eaten very well that week,

540
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,480
or we might have had a big weekend on the pierce

541
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,779
and Monday comes around and we're feeling pretty shit.

542
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,440
We're feeling pretty shit about ourselves.

543
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,119
But I think just going back to basics, right?

544
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,160
If you're feeling down or you're feeling crappy,

545
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,079
go back to those basics, check in.

546
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:02,640
Are you feeding yourself nutritious foods?

547
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,400
Are you moving your body?

548
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,180
Now, for me, obviously, I like running.

549
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,140
Luke, what do you do?

550
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:10,339
Do you still play footy or are you-

551
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,259
I don't, Cherie.

552
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,119
I finished, God, how long ago is it now?

553
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,339
15 or 16 years ago.

554
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,259
So I didn't play again after I finished playing for a living.

555
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:22,539
But morning routines are right in my wheelhouse, Cherie.

556
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,039
My wife, Bec, is a yoga instructor.

557
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,519
So I start with a bit of meditation.

558
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,119
I'm into a bit of yoga.

559
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,700
We go for a walk together every day.

560
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,539
It sounds very, very soft and it is very soft,

561
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:32,539
but I'm pretty-

562
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm pretty consistent at it and it works.

563
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,740
Okay.

564
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,059
Okay, well, that's good.

565
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,599
Amazing.

566
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,539
So you look really smug over there, Luke.

567
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,619
You look really smug doing your yoga.

568
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,420
That sounded smug, didn't it?

569
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,319
Doing your yoga, meditating.

570
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:47,940
It didn't mean to sound smug,

571
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,640
but I know what it's like to have a big night on the piss still

572
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,140
and wake up and not do it as well.

573
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,940
So it's-

574
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,259
And you feel shit, don't you?

575
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:57,619
You do feel shit.

576
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,359
So check back in.

577
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,500
Are you eating good food?

578
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,559
Are you moving your body?

579
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,740
You don't have to.

580
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,000
Are we doing yoga and meditating like Luke,

581
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,839
if you want to go for it?

582
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,440
But if there is another form of exercise that you love doing,

583
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,539
do that.

584
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
And then I'm a really big believer

585
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,380
in having a great morning as well,

586
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,980
because I think how we set up our morning

587
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,140
affects how our day goes.

588
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,519
And I think my morning routine

589
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,200
is nowhere near as extensive as yours, Luke.

590
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,619
So when I wake up in the morning,

591
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,720
I have a good morning.

592
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,339
I drink my coffee, right?

593
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,460
And then the first thing I do is something that I don't do.

594
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,779
And I don't pick up my phone.

595
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,539
Because I find like that's,

596
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:40,920
it's almost a habit that we have, right?

597
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,960
We wake up, we grab our phone, we look at it.

598
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,000
And then our mind is suddenly elsewhere.

599
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,339
We're suddenly thinking about emails,

600
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:49,680
what our boss needs from us

601
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,099
or what our team needs from us,

602
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,559
what we haven't done for other people,

603
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,759
writing back to people's messages,

604
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,220
looking at Instagram stories.

605
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,460
And before we know it,

606
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,980
we've just lost 20 minutes of our day,

607
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,420
just staring at a little box.

608
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,619
So I don't pick up my phone,

609
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:05,279
I try not to pick up my phone until like eight o'clock,

610
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,059
which is when Michael does the school drop-off.

611
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,160
So he takes the kids to school.

612
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,619
And then I'm like, oh, thank goodness.

613
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,420
I've got a bit of peace and quiet in the house by myself.

614
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,279
And then that's generally when I start my work day.

615
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,799
But yeah, trying not to look at my phone.

616
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,740
I find that helps me a lot with how I feel about myself

617
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,079
and conversely, how happy I am as well.

618
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,079
Yeah, it's a common thing, isn't it, Therese?

619
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:32,240
Yeah.

620
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,900
I'm getting over the smugness of my answer before.

621
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:40,200
But Mike Dunlap, who I spoke to just recently,

622
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,559
the assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks,

623
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,779
has coached around the world.

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,119
And he really made a point of that.

625
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,640
And I still get sucked in, don't you?

626
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,000
That algorithm is so powerful, isn't it?

627
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,359
The light comes on and you say,

628
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,259
I'll just check this one message.

629
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,440
And before you know it,

630
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,119
the first 45 minutes of your day

631
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,900
has just been into that vortex of work.

632
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:00,180
And then I feel it's hard to get back.

633
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,539
Your day then has started on you.

634
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:01,960
Oh, it is.

635
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,480
Because you're starting in a really weird spot.

636
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,319
And you almost start your day feeling resentful and irritated.

637
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,720
And I don't think that's the best way to start your day.

638
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,119
Yeah.

639
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:19,079
I think a better way is to start having a coffee.

640
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,740
For me, it's like playing with the kids

641
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,380
or getting their stuff ready for school.

642
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,779
It's drinking my coffee outside with my partner,

643
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,900
having a little chat to him.

644
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,019
It might be five minutes.

645
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:30,799
It might be 20 minutes.

646
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,859
You know, so however much amount of time it is,

647
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,619
I'm just happy for it and grateful for it.

648
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,079
And I try to think about what it is in that day

649
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,440
that I'm looking forward to.

650
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,819
Because I find that, you know,

651
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,039
if we're looking forward to our days,

652
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
then we look forward to our week.

653
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,380
And that means we, you know,

654
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,079
by extension, we're looking forward to our lives.

655
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:54,740
And I also think just trying to start your day

656
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,140
with a grateful frame of mind.

657
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,460
So I try and think of the things I'm grateful for, right?

658
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,940
Grateful for my business.

659
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,720
Beautiful family.

660
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,299
Grateful for my mom,

661
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,859
because I had a good chat with her yesterday.

662
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:09,779
Grateful for the cup of coffee that my partner made,

663
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,539
whatever it is.

664
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,460
Just really simple things.

665
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,359
It doesn't have to be something flashy and instantaneous.

666
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,819
You know, if you are going on a boat

667
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,500
with Beyonce and Jay-Z in the south of France,

668
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,579
like awesome, good for you.

669
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,700
But for everyone else,

670
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,420
we probably don't have things like that

671
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,400
coming up in our lives.

672
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,940
So just small, littler things.

673
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,779
Like what you're looking forward to on the weekend

674
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,180
or if you had a nice bit of quality time

675
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,559
with your kids, reading them a book, whatever it is.

676
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,960
And I think that if we start our days feeling grateful,

677
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:46,539
I think that helps us to build a more positive mindset, right?

678
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:49,019
Because we're laying down those grateful.

679
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,559
I don't know what they're called, actually.

680
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,000
The wires.

681
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,279
The neural pathways, aren't you?

682
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,920
I was listening to...

683
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,019
Neural pathways, that's it.

684
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,599
That's it.

685
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:00,940
Very smug there.

686
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,619
Very smug.

687
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,920
I've got some smugness, haven't I, today.

688
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,000
I was thinking of that because Joe Dispenza,

689
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:11,599
I was listening to a podcast the other day,

690
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,660
and the science behind what you're saying,

691
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,700
Drew, is so relevant now.

692
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,599
And the data is there.

693
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,920
It's a practice what you're talking about.

694
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,819
And then when you open those neural pathways,

695
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,759
then they get stronger, isn't it?

696
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,660
It's a bit like you running and post,

697
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,319
you get fitter because you put one step in front of the other.

698
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,140
No one expects to be able to run an ultra marathon

699
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,519
without building that pathway.

700
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,019
And so to not think our mind doesn't work the same way

701
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:37,200
is really a naive to think.

702
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:40,319
And you know that with that positive pathways you create,

703
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,539
it makes us healthier.

704
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,480
The science is there.

705
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,440
It makes you healthier and happier.

706
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,059
And likewise, the negative thoughts make us sick.

707
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,900
And not a lot of people still grasp that, Drew, in lots of ways.

708
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,579
And clearly, you read your book.

709
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,779
It's a big part of what you do.

710
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,359
And it's not as challenging as some people may think.

711
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,819
You know, to think of three things that you're grateful for every morning.

712
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,220
It's quite a simple little exercise.

713
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,940
You can also journal every night of three things in your day that went great.

714
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,059
And those are very simple, very straightforward exercises

715
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,299
that people might, you know, they might almost think,

716
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,079
oh, that's so easy and so straightforward.

717
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,599
That won't work.

718
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,039
But actually, the science is there and the proof is there.

719
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:30,039
And Dr. Laurie Santos, who did, she did this, like,

720
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:35,079
course about, you know, positive psychology and wellness.

721
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,319
And she said that she found through her data that if you write a thank you letter

722
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,619
to someone, you know, to your postman, to your family, to your mom,

723
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,200
whoever it is, she said the increase in wellness for yourself

724
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,900
or the increase in well-being for yourself can often last up to a month.

725
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,339
So if you think, if you sit down, write a thank you letter to someone,

726
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,500
post it, and then that's going to help you feel better about yourself

727
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,000
for a month.

728
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:04,460
Like, that's a pretty amazing impact that it's going to have on your day.

729
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,420
And that process will probably take you, I don't know,

730
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,119
maybe five minutes to write the letter, five minutes to stop by the post office

731
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,559
on your way to work, so 10 minutes.

732
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,160
I think that's a pretty good return on investment.

733
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah, beautifully said.

734
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,420
And as you, you know, the alternative of starting on your phone

735
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,720
and getting sucked into that or writing or just even thinking three things

736
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,200
to start the day you're grateful, it can be life-changing.

737
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,579
It can literally change the way you,

738
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,920
you live and clearly you do that.

739
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,940
You mentioned your partner, Michael.

740
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,779
He sounds like a ripper.

741
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,599
He sounds like the sort of guy you'd love to have a beer with

742
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,660
and catch up with.

743
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,779
Yeah, he's annoying.

744
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,819
Everyone always loves him so much.

745
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,359
It's so annoying.

746
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,460
Everyone's like, oh, where's Michael today?

747
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:46,859
Where is he?

748
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,859
We want to meet him.

749
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,720
Does he have a brother?

750
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,740
But I love there's some words that I again want to read back to you

751
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,579
because I love what you're saying this.

752
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:59,880
And when talking about Michael in the past, you said,

753
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,980
if you want a partner who's mature and in touch with their emotions,

754
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,859
are you mature and in touch with your emotions?

755
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:10,319
And, you know, you sort of get the partner you deserve to hear in some ways,

756
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,720
don't you?

757
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,920
Because clearly you've attracted the person you have because of the person you are.

758
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,900
Yeah, I think so.

759
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,180
And again, you know, I think for everyone that may not always be the case.

760
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,799
I know there's things like coercive control and abusive relationship,

761
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:36,099
so I guess if you're talking about general healthy relationships,

762
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,920
you know, I think if you're living your best life, if your life is full,

763
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,700
if you've got people around you who love you, who encourage you,

764
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,940
who aren't afraid to tell you the hard truth, I think that's really important as well.

765
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,299
I know that's what Michael does for me because so often,

766
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,559
and you might get this too, Luke, you might have people who blow smoke up your ass

767
00:33:59,559 --> 00:33:59,779
all the time.

768
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,460
And tell you how awesome you are.

769
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,519
And it's so, you know, and Michael and my dad actually are probably like the only people

770
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,300
who will just tell me how it is.

771
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,239
Like I remember the first time I gave a speech, my dad came along with me

772
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,059
and I was so nervous, forgot what I was saying, like quickly flashed all of my slides

773
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:29,340
and then I got into the car with my dad and I said,

774
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,460
Dad, how was that?

775
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,320
And he goes, it was shit ass.

776
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:34,380
He said, that was terrible.

777
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,500
He goes, did you get paid money for that?

778
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,460
And I said, yeah.

779
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,500
He goes, well, you should be embarrassed.

780
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,280
Like he was, he was, he was ruthless.

781
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,079
But like I think it's important to have people in your life who aren't afraid

782
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,860
to tell you the truth and aren't afraid to tell you the uncomfortable things as well.

783
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,420
And I know that's what Michael does for me.

784
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,440
So he'll still do that to you if he feels like you're going off the reservation,

785
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:05,559
you'll get the direct feedback from him?

786
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,880
I'll get the direct feedback even if it's not solicited.

787
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,619
And I think feedback, you know, is a bit of a gift to you.

788
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,619
It's misinterpreted sometimes.

789
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,840
It hurts your feelings though at the time.

790
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,820
I know it's a gift.

791
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
I know it's a gift.

792
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,079
But when someone tells you your speech was shit ass.

793
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,119
So what do you say to your dad in that moment?

794
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,019
What was your response?

795
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,480
Really, dad?

796
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,219
Yeah, it was pretty terrible.

797
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:33,420
It was pretty horrible.

798
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,320
And then I was like, oh.

799
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,360
No, but dad was good.

800
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,019
He was like, look, if you want to pursue this as a career,

801
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,280
you're going to have to get better at it.

802
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,840
But he said, if you don't want to do this,

803
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,159
then like don't invest the time and energy into getting better at it.

804
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,119
Yeah, brilliant advice.

805
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,559
So like that's, you know, that's great advice.

806
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,559
It's like, well, if you want to do something, you've got to spend energy,

807
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,219
time, commitment, focus into getting better at that chosen sport,

808
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,940
whether it's footy, whether it's running, whatever it is that you're doing.

809
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,039
And if it's something that you don't actually want to do,

810
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,019
then like don't waste your time.

811
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,099
Don't beat yourself up because you think you should be better at it.

812
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,219
Just let it go.

813
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,789
I love hearing that engineering, pragmatic, data-driven part of your brain,

814
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:28,110
that comes out in, you know, it's a matter of fact.

815
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,690
And the way that you operate, how it serves you incredibly well.

816
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,449
Is there a spiritual side in there?

817
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:36,530
As well as the engineering part to you?

818
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:41,909
I'm not religious as such, but I do believe in energy, right?

819
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:46,269
So I think if you're feeling, if you're in a good mood and you walk into work

820
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:49,829
and you say good morning to people and you're dynamic and you're charismatic,

821
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,710
then you have the ability to lift people up, right?

822
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,570
You have the ability to make others feel better about the people that they are.

823
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,469
And you said Russell was like that, Russell Howard.

824
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:01,469
Russell Howcroft, yeah, absolutely.

825
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,610
Sorry, Russell Howcroft.

826
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:03,369
Sorry, Russell.

827
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:06,590
I'm a big fan, but sorry, I didn't know your last name just then.

828
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,210
Conversely, if you walk into work and you're shitty, you're annoyed, you're grumpy,

829
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:16,849
you give people one word answers, you're not going to particularly light anyone up.

830
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,150
You're not going to particularly make anyone feel good about themselves.

831
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,969
So I do think the energy that we have, how we carry ourselves, how we conduct ourselves,

832
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,449
how interested we are when we ask people questions,

833
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:32,690
how much we listen to their responses and how we make people feel about themselves.

834
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,610
I think definitely I'm a massive believer in that.

835
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,530
And I know with myself, I always try to be a positive influence on others.

836
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,690
And I always try to do that with other people.

837
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,210
So I'm not spiritual as such, but I do believe in energy.

838
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,289
Yeah, I get it.

839
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:53,650
I understand your thoughts on it.

840
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,369
And it leads into what we are seeing from leaders and your story is remarkable.

841
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,170
And I love the privilege of sitting down and being able to hear it.

842
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,769
In person, and we're seeing people who have the impact like you do.

843
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,869
There's some consistent dimensions of what leadership looks like in different settings,

844
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:15,789
whether from a sporting background or doing what you're doing and inspiring people.

845
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,909
And we think most people start with a sense of self-leadership,

846
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,630
that without self-leadership, you can't lead others.

847
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:24,849
Do you think about self-leadership for you?

848
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,309
Honestly, no.

849
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,489
Well, you tell me, what does it actually mean?

850
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,889
Well, to me, it means, Terea,

851
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:39,909
the idea that I've got an opportunity myself to live up to the person I want to be.

852
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:45,190
And if I'm not actually practicing that really smug routine that I shared with you before,

853
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,429
if I'm actually talking to other people about how to start the day in the morning,

854
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,469
if I'm actually not doing that, then I haven't really tapped into self-leadership.

855
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:58,670
If I'm asking questions of other people and giving my thoughts,

856
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,230
but I'm not living that myself, that's how I think about self-leadership.

857
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:02,849
But for other people,

858
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:04,829
it's got a different meaning.

859
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,610
Does it resonate with you at all?

860
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,230
Yeah, I think it does.

861
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:11,230
I think it's firstly, you've got to practice what you preach.

862
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:18,530
I think another aspect is not asking people around you to do things that you wouldn't do yourself.

863
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,190
So that can be, for example, with my team, or that could be with my family as well.

864
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,690
But it's also holding yourself in high regard.

865
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,070
And I think we've got, and I don't know if it's just,

866
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,869
actually, I think it is mainly,

867
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,789
where it's not, we don't like it when someone has tickets on themselves.

868
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:46,010
We don't like it when someone's too ambitious, or not humble, or too braggy.

869
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,550
All of those are very un-Australian qualities.

870
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,230
And so it can be really difficult to say,

871
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,489
no, I hold myself to a high standard of conduct,

872
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:02,489
and I hold myself to a high standard across the board.

873
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:05,449
But I think that's what self-leadership is as well.

874
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:13,670
And I also think part of that surely must be acknowledging that you're not perfect.

875
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,889
So we're not these Audemars robots walking around being like,

876
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,090
I hold high standards for myself, that we're not perfect.

877
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,010
And we do slip up, and we do fail.

878
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,969
And we don't always say the right thing at the right time.

879
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:30,150
But we're okay with that as well.

880
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,369
So I think there's an element of self-compassion there as well.

881
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,530
Yeah, beautiful answer.

882
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,809
I heard you mention this before,

883
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:39,650
but the second dimension of leadership we talk about is,

884
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:43,849
you know, the leader's really conscious how they positively impact others in their environment.

885
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,949
And we heard you say that from every room you walk into,

886
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,050
you've got a chance to have an impact on someone.

887
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:51,730
Is that how you think about it day to day?

888
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,150
Is that the opportunity's there to positively impact others?

889
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,210
Yeah, I think so.

890
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,969
And that can be hard, right, when you're bogged down in the detail.

891
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,449
Like if I'm looking at the spreadsheet, or if I'm looking at a penis,

892
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,650
or if I've got to make decisions with my running program,

893
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,769
or if I've got to, it can be really hard to remove yourself from that and think,

894
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:14,250
hey, I have to think about making an impact on people.

895
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:19,630
So it actually can be hard to remind yourself of that on a day-to-day basis.

896
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:23,070
But I think, you know, if you tie that back into your morning routine,

897
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,110
you can be grateful for the opportunities that you have that day.

898
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,849
So, for example, this conversation with you.

899
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:32,190
And I think it's good to remind yourself,

900
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,110
you know, not all the time, because that's how exhausting would that be,

901
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,650
reminding yourself all the time that you have to be a positive impact

902
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,110
for everyone else around you.

903
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,670
I think that would be quite exhausting for anyone to carry out.

904
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,909
But I think it's good to remind yourself from time to time

905
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,750
that you do get to make a positive impact on people.

906
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,329
And whether that's by people listening to this podcast or your podcast, Luke,

907
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,489
or whether it's even at work,

908
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,329
being that person who walks in in a good mood

909
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:07,449
and is a good, like a good egg for people to work with.

910
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,489
But people don't really care what your skill set is.

911
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,489
But like if you're a good, well, sorry, I shouldn't say that.

912
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,190
People do care what your skill set is,

913
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:18,989
particularly if you're like the engineer for a large construction project.

914
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,710
So they do care what your skill set is.

915
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,789
But I think if you're a good person for people to work with,

916
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:27,650
I think that says a lot about the person that you are.

917
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,369
And I also think with your family,

918
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,769
so often we give everything to our jobs and to our careers.

919
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,489
And we might come home and we're so exhausted

920
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,610
that we might only mutter a couple of grunts to our partner

921
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,289
and we might be a little bit annoyed with our kids

922
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:48,090
and we might not give them the, I guess,

923
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,030
the energy and attention that they need as well.

924
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:54,929
And so I think life isn't perfect.

925
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:58,590
And, you know, some days, some weeks you might be more invested in work

926
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,449
and I think that's normal and that's okay.

927
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:04,429
But I also think it's great to give some of that positive influence

928
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:06,829
back onto your family and your personal life.

929
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:13,309
We talk about leaders really clear around creating their vision

930
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,010
and how they go about sharing it

931
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,269
and what you have done right throughout your life.

932
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:19,769
But in the second chapter, you know,

933
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:23,170
to have one book that is a bestseller is an extraordinary achievement.

934
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:24,349
You're consistently doing it.

935
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:28,929
You've got a great running community and building an incredible business

936
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,469
and having a massive impact on others.

937
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:33,949
Have you been, can you share with us how you've sort of created that vision

938
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,849
and how you've gone about making it happen?

939
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,550
Yeah.

940
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,710
Well, I think at the start, it's okay if you don't know exactly

941
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,170
what it is that you're trying to do because, you know,

942
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,050
so many people might get hung up on creating a 10-year bulleted out,

943
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,489
detailed, extensive business plan with multiple spreadsheets

944
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,929
inputting into it.

945
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,309
That might be overkill because you might not actually know

946
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,309
what it is that you're...

947
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:04,210
or thinking about doing is what it is that you want to be doing

948
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,090
or maybe you don't enjoy doing it or maybe it might change.

949
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,289
So I think a general direction is helpful,

950
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,670
but don't get hung up on knowing like the exact degree

951
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,750
where you're going to end up.

952
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:20,309
I think that, you know, not getting too hung up on that

953
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,769
and also acknowledging and understanding that as you go,

954
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,349
you'll work it out.

955
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,349
You know, we had those really bad flyers in...

956
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,530
It was in the summer of 2019, right?

957
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,489
So the fires were burning all up and down the east coast of Australia

958
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:39,409
and actually all around Australia they were burning

959
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,969
and in my hometown of Ulladulla, the fires were really bad.

960
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,690
We had fires burning north of us, south of us, west of us.

961
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,269
So our town was pretty much encircled by flames

962
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:55,010
and a girlfriend and I, we thought we wanted to do something

963
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,329
to help our community or help the communities

964
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:03,530
around Australia that were going through these bushfires

965
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,090
and we wanted to help small businesses

966
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,130
because in our community, all of the beautiful little businesses

967
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,809
that rely on that summer trade, there was no tourists in the town.

968
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:12,829
Everyone had gone home.

969
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,750
So we were worried about all of those businesses

970
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,989
because they would have, you know, ordered extra stocks,

971
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,429
organised extra supplies, all of that type of stuff

972
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,710
and then they wouldn't be able to sell it.

973
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:28,050
So we decided we wanted to do something and we wanted to do this,

974
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,230
spend with them.

975
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,889
We had a spend with them campaign which we thought was going to be

976
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:34,429
an Instagram page and we weren't really sure what we were going to do.

977
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,070
We were like, we'll just profile some businesses.

978
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:38,809
Don't really know what's going to happen.

979
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,889
Now, we could have sat down, put more thought into it,

980
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,309
planned it out more, got on board extra resources,

981
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,510
done all of this work, mapped out everyone's,

982
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:53,050
what everyone's job role was going to be and mapped it all out

983
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,550
and spent weeks doing all of that or we could have just gone,

984
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,469
fuck it, we don't know.

985
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,210
Let's just put it out.

986
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,030
Let's see what happens.

987
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:07,110
So we just did the logo in Canva, put it out there and we were like,

988
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,289
oh, well, this could just fall over.

989
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:10,329
We might not get anything.

990
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,969
And within a couple of days, we had over 200,000 followers.

991
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:16,090
The businesses that we profiled, you know,

992
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,349
they were making enough money from people buying stuff

993
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,530
from their store to make their mortgage repayments.

994
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:27,050
People made more money from one post than six months worth of markets.

995
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:29,050
So we really helped Swansea.

996
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,889
We helped small businesses around Australia and if we had have stopped

997
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,690
and if we had have thought about it and if we had have put on additional

998
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,949
resources, cause we were both staying up until like, you know,

999
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:42,769
3am to write back to everyone.

1000
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:46,349
And I was two weeks away from giving birth to my second child.

1001
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,630
So it was a crazy, crazy time.

1002
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,289
But if we had have stopped and thought about it,

1003
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,409
then we might have not have done it.

1004
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,070
You know, we might have been like, oh, it's heaps of work and I don't know if

1005
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:58,929
it's going to work.

1006
00:46:58,929 --> 00:46:59,190
And.

1007
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,110
You know, maybe by the time we were ready, it would have been three months down the track

1008
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,570
and then maybe the businesses might not have needed so much support.

1009
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,949
So I think if you've got an idea, don't overthink it.

1010
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:12,909
Just put it out there.

1011
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:14,170
See what happens.

1012
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,010
Maybe people will froth on it and you'll say, great, awesome.

1013
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,210
This is a good idea.

1014
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,510
Let's get let's get some more.

1015
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,409
Let's build the team.

1016
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,829
Let's get more help in.

1017
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,550
Maybe no one cares about it.

1018
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,630
In which case there's your answer as well.

1019
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,130
It's brilliant advice to read and you do.

1020
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,289
Hear that in different ways, isn't it?

1021
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:34,769
We can spend so much time, as you said, creating something that we don't really know

1022
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:35,769
anyone cares about.

1023
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,010
But I love that story, as you said, isn't it?

1024
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:38,369
Get it out.

1025
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:42,409
And then sometimes you can just improve it as it goes and you test it straight away.

1026
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:47,590
And what you did was change people's lives, you know, in the time they needed it more

1027
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,690
than anyone else.

1028
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,949
Curiosity is a dimension of leadership.

1029
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:55,650
And through people's sense of curiosity, we're seeing that word a lot.

1030
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,530
That's how people approach how they want to get better and learn.

1031
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:58,730
Just.

1032
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,489
Does curiosity form part of your thinking?

1033
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:09,409
Look, I'm probably not as articulate as that, but by nature, I am a curious person.

1034
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:10,909
I presume you are too, Luke.

1035
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:14,789
That's why you've got this podcast, because you're obviously curious about other people

1036
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:19,150
and how they've applied, you know, leadership to their lives.

1037
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,130
So I think by nature, I am a curious person.

1038
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,889
I don't know whether or not during the day, you know, I don't stop at something and be

1039
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:28,730
like, huh?

1040
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,730
I'm curious.

1041
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,329
I'm curious about that.

1042
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:33,989
But I always want to find out the reason, right?

1043
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:40,010
So even with, we've just finished one of our recent launches for the running program.

1044
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,389
So I've got all the data to go through and I really like doing the post-launch reports

1045
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:51,289
because that kind of, I love looking at the data, but I also like seeing what works and

1046
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:53,250
what wasn't as effective.

1047
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,530
So I guess that is an example of me being curious as well, but I don't know if I'm ever,

1048
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,530
if I ever notice it as much.

1049
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,530
Yeah.

1050
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,530
Yeah.

1051
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:09,369
I love the way, you know, you articulate, clearly that's, you know, something that you

1052
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:14,170
do every day, but not overthinking it, it just, it just happens for you.

1053
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:19,710
And you get another incredible contribution, the running club that Turia has created.

1054
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,530
Communicating with clarity is again, you know, we're pretty, pretty formal here in lots of

1055
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,530
ways, Turia, but you know-

1056
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,530
We are very formal.

1057
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,530
I don't know what a lot of this stuff is.

1058
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,530
Yeah.

1059
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,530
I don't know what a lot of this stuff means.

1060
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,369
Except you do it more easy, more easily and better than anyone else.

1061
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:38,789
I mean, to write three bestselling books, to host your podcast and do it as, as brilliantly

1062
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:41,750
as you do, clearly your communication works.

1063
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,710
I mean, again, it's probably not, it doesn't sound like it's something you overthink.

1064
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,710
You just, you just do.

1065
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,710
Is that-

1066
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,750
Well, I think, yeah, I think don't overthink things to start with.

1067
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,530
Put it out there, whatever it is, like that's the approach I've taken with my writing.

1068
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,530
Yeah.

1069
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,530
I send out a weekly letter every week to, I don't know, I don't know.

1070
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:02,530
I send it out to over 50,000 people and I don't overthink it, right?

1071
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:07,610
And at the start, they were pretty shit because it was the first time I'd blogged, so I wouldn't

1072
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,610
know what to write about.

1073
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,909
And then I just got better at it because I was consistent with it.

1074
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:17,090
And then that's how I've written these books, just by being consistent.

1075
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:23,369
You know, you don't, well, maybe some people do, I don't write a book overnight.

1076
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:26,949
It's like 20 minutes every day.

1077
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:27,489
Just sitting down at my desk.

1078
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:32,250
Writing, I might write something really articulate and really insightful.

1079
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,469
I might write something really rubbish, but it doesn't really matter because I'm in that,

1080
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:40,730
I'm in that practice or I'm in that habit of writing every day.

1081
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:47,250
Speaking to people on my podcast, you're obviously a far more experienced podcaster than me, Luke.

1082
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:52,570
I've only just started, but even if I listened back to past episodes, you know, I think,

1083
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,570
oh gosh, that was really awkward.

1084
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,570
That episode was terrible to read.

1085
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,570
Yeah.

1086
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,489
Yeah.

1087
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:58,489
Yeah.

1088
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,489
Terrible.

1089
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,489
But I'm, but I'm getting better at it.

1090
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:02,610
And the same with the running program as well.

1091
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:07,010
I think if you do something every day, if you allow yourself, if you give yourself a

1092
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:12,150
bit of grace to not be perfect straight away, to not have all of the answers straight away.

1093
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,889
And I think that's important in leadership too, right?

1094
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:16,570
You don't have to have all of the answers.

1095
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,610
You can just say, good question.

1096
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,150
I don't actually know the answer to that right now, but let me come back to you or let's

1097
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,250
work it out together, or maybe we'll be able to figure that out in the future.

1098
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,250
Yeah.

1099
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,250
Yeah.

1100
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,250
Yeah.

1101
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,250
Yeah.

1102
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:35,170
So I think that's really important in leadership, but not overthinking things and whatever it

1103
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,449
is that you're doing, whether it's a book or a podcast, or you've got this great idea,

1104
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:43,949
put it out there, see what people think, see if there's a desire for it, see if there's

1105
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:45,489
a need for it.

1106
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:50,769
And like I said before, if people run with that idea and they like it, that's great.

1107
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:55,070
If people give you some insight onto what you could do or what you could do differently,

1108
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,250
that's also a great result.

1109
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:03,190
And if no one cares, again, not so much a great result for yourself, but also it is because then

1110
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,849
you're not wasting all of this emotional energy thinking about this idea whether or not it will

1111
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:13,230
work. I love hearing your courage just to do. It's brilliant. And be prepared to reflect and say,

1112
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,829
you know what, I started there. If I look back, I was always going to get better. But a lot of

1113
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:23,769
people don't have that courage just to start, isn't it? And become an author or have a go

1114
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:28,469
knowing that, as you said, and I love how you explained that really well, isn't it? If you find

1115
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:33,070
out really quickly that no one's interested, that actually is pretty beneficial too, isn't it?

1116
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:40,510
Yeah. That's obviously, if you've got an idea for this pizza holder eater thing and you think

1117
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,489
it's brilliant, you think it's going to change the world and you put it out there to your friends

1118
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:52,469
and family and they go, oh, yeah, I guess it could be a good idea. Or maybe you start a website or

1119
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,750
you start a social media blog.

1120
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:58,869
Or whatever it is. And you don't really get much back or you just hear crickets,

1121
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:05,070
then it might be disappointing for you, but that will be an answer as well.

1122
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:09,929
Therese, how important has collaboration been for you in your world?

1123
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:17,829
Really important, I think. And I feel really grateful. I've got a great team of women that

1124
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:23,070
I work with. And I think it's incredibly gracious to have people that are working

1125
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,750
with you. And I think it's incredibly gracious to have people that are working with you.

1126
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,010
And I think it's incredibly gracious to have people that are working with you on your vision.

1127
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,550
They're spending their time, their energy, their focus, their attention. They could be doing that

1128
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,469
for something for themselves or they could be doing that for someone else. But instead,

1129
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:40,949
they've chosen to be doing that to help me to execute my vision. So I think that's incredibly

1130
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:47,909
gracious of people to do. And so I think collaboration, I feel like, again, I'm not

1131
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:52,750
as formal. I'm not as formal as you. I don't sit down with my team and be like, okay,

1132
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:53,730
we're doing this. I'm not as formal as you. I'm not as formal as you. I'm not as formal as you.

1133
00:53:53,730 --> 00:54:00,469
We're doing a formal collaboration session right now. Let's all collaborate. But we'll

1134
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:05,110
have a chat. And if they say, what about this? And I try and listen to that idea and try

1135
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,789
and investigate it a little bit further and try and see if it's an idea that's going to

1136
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:10,110
stick.

1137
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:17,030
Brilliant answer, as they all have been asking these two questions of all the leaders and

1138
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:22,909
inspiring people like you, Terea, and your story is remarkable and inspiring and learn

1139
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:23,610
so much from listening to you.

1140
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:23,690
Thank you.

1141
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:23,710
Thank you.

1142
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,130
Thank you for speaking to you today. Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1143
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:35,050
This is probably going to sound sappy, but I think my partner, Michael, because he's a

1144
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:44,170
beautiful human being. He's humble and he's self-effacing and he's just a good egg,

1145
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,670
just a good guy. And I think I'm someone that's, like I've already said, I'm an

1146
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:55,389
overachiever and I'm quite ambitious and I can get really caught up in what it is that I'm

1147
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:59,710
doing or what it is that I'm achieving or what it is that I'm moving forward towards.

1148
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:05,690
I think he's a really great reminder to take a step back and to reflect on my relationships

1149
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:10,829
in my life. So my relationship with him, our relationship with our kids, our relationship

1150
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:17,869
with our families and friends. It's a really great reminder for me to step back and reflect

1151
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:23,469
on the fact that it's our relationships really that are the most fulfilling and the most

1152
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:25,349
enriching thing in our world.

1153
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,349
And it also can be our relationships with our work colleagues as well. Like I said,

1154
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:31,889
I've got a great team of ladies that I work with. We have a lot of fun together.

1155
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:37,269
So I think those relationships too are ones that I cherish, but I think probably would be

1156
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:39,590
Michael would be someone that I would look up to a lot.

1157
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:45,269
What an amazing answer. And I have had this conversation before, I think even on the podcast

1158
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:51,789
where, I mean, clearly as you just articulated, then he reminds you of how important that is.

1159
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:55,250
And for you to actually spend some time, we often,

1160
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:58,349
all of us are, when we're trying to grow a business or trying to expand stuff, we can

1161
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,230
put all this energy and all this thought and you've got incredible wisdom to share, but

1162
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:07,309
we don't often apply that to the people closest to us, do we? And we expect good results in

1163
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:13,349
our relationship. So it's a void, isn't it? I think it is for a lot of us. We don't apply

1164
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:15,710
that same wisdom. Does that make sense to you?

1165
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:21,190
Yeah, that's so true. We go into work, we've got an outline of what we're going to achieve

1166
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,230
that day. We've got all of our meetings booked in. We get through the day, we do our work,

1167
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:31,909
everything. And then we come home and we're just like, fuck, I'm exhausted. What are we doing for

1168
00:56:31,909 --> 00:56:36,969
dinner? And then you sit down, you eat dinner, you watch TV, then you go to bed. And I think

1169
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:41,389
some nights are just going to be like that. Because I do think it's, if you enjoy your work

1170
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:45,809
and you enjoy what you do, then you're going to put a lot of yourself into it. And that's not a

1171
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:51,190
bad thing at all. I think that's great. Especially if you find your work fulfilling. There's this new

1172
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,230
concept going around called quiet quitting. Have you heard of it?

1173
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,090
No, I haven't.

1174
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,230
Yeah, well, it's when people go to work, but they don't really love their job.

1175
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:07,309
But so they just, they put in the bare minimum, which is also a strategy, right? Because if you

1176
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:11,289
just go to work, you just want to get paid, you just want to go home in the Arvo

1177
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:16,670
to your family. I also think that that is a strategy. And that might be a strategy that

1178
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:22,070
works for some people out there as well. But I think with our relationships,

1179
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,750
we know we have all of these plans,

1180
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:30,389
for our business and our plans for our lives. But we don't ever do any of that with our

1181
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:35,469
relationships. We don't ever kind of plan out our weekends. And I know a lot of people will be like,

1182
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:41,289
no, I'm not planning out my weekend. I've just spent a whole week being in meetings and everything.

1183
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:47,590
But I think having a little bit of thought into that time with your family or into that time with

1184
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:53,429
your partner, whether it's date night or whether it's spending time together, I think just applying

1185
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,230
a little bit of thought to that can be really, really helpful. And I think that's a really,

1186
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,769
really helpful for us. Because there's, I don't know if you've seen that meme, it's like

1187
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:07,610
everyone else gets the best of you and then your family just gets what's left over. And I think

1188
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:13,889
it should be more of an equilibrium. I haven't seen that meme, but it does make

1189
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:18,809
sense, isn't it? We do it ourselves sometimes to our own parents and then we see it through

1190
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:23,550
our own kids as well. Yeah. And I think particularly for women,

1191
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,829
not saying that being a dad doesn't have challenges, but I think for women in particular,

1192
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:36,269
especially these days, for example, if Michael drops off the kids at daycare,

1193
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:43,090
people will be like, oh my gosh, he's such a great dad. But she is, he is a great dad. But if I pick

1194
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:48,110
up my kids at daycare, do you think anyone is saying, oh my gosh, she's such a great mom,

1195
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:53,449
she's picking up her kids from daycare. So the standard of care that we have for women and their

1196
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:55,210
kids is extremely high. And I think that's a really, really important thing. And I think

1197
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:01,429
the standards we have for men and their kids is extremely low. And even if I'm, you know,

1198
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:06,289
if I go for a surf, people will say, oh, where are the kids? Is Michael babysitting them?

1199
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:13,610
And I always say, well, no, he's not babysitting. He's with his biological children. They are,

1200
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:19,690
they are also his as well. So I think something needs to change there. I think

1201
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,570
the standards that we hold women to account to with children and the standards we hold

1202
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:24,650
men to account to with children are very different. And I think that's a really important thing. And I

1203
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,210
think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really

1204
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:30,269
count to with kids should become more of an equilibrium as well and that is a really powerful

1205
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:37,949
statement terry and i and it's very true you know um a father of four four three yeah you're a bull

1206
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:44,710
i'm not sure i'm not sure we thought it through yeah terry but uh my wife beck is just a is a

1207
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:51,070
superstar and and it's it's the you're right to have equity in your relationship is i find it

1208
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:57,110
really unfair that often the burden and the the feedback dad sweep in and get all this glory and

1209
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:02,170
we get all this praise for doing very little really a lot of the time and exactly the role

1210
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:08,210
that she's played in their life has changed their lives remarkably um and you're right we need to

1211
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:14,469
shift that conversation you know big time i try to but i think uh not enough to sort of say you

1212
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:19,989
know the four kids that we've created they are overwhelmingly who they are because of the

1213
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,050
influence of of

1214
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:27,170
their mother and um yeah it needs to be celebrated more we um are a bit obsessed with collaboration

1215
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:32,769
uh terry we've got a leadership space and passion about a business we created seven years ago

1216
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:36,949
called a leader and our whole thing is about this world of of collaboration and great things happen

1217
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:41,489
when great people get together and collaborate so my final question to you if you could collaborate

1218
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:46,829
with anyone in the world on anything there's a whole range of interests that are in your space

1219
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:50,949
is there anyone that springs to mind i wish i had prepared

1220
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:54,849
for this question because now i'm like i feel like i'm in a test situation i'm under

1221
01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:00,110
i'm under a lot of pressure uh i can't actually think of anyone right now

1222
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:05,329
and i like i'm gonna buy you some buy you some time here terry because it's it's a touch unfair

1223
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:12,090
um to to land that that on you but uh and maybe that's so unfair what do you mean a touch unfair

1224
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:15,449
if i had have had homework i would have done it

1225
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:20,670
yeah that's right i like it's the engineer coming out give me the give me the

1226
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:25,550
parameters and i can make it work yes yes if i don't have the parameters i don't know what it is

1227
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:32,429
that i'm doing i love it uh on any of your passions it could be surfing it could be marathon running it

1228
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:39,590
could be uh writing books could be your family anyone in out there that i'll tell you so we've

1229
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:48,449
had people from elon musk to a childhood friend to um the answers have been vast and and some

1230
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:50,929
people have just said exactly this you know what i don't know i don't know i don't know

1231
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:56,809
and that's just as good as well well look i'm gonna leave that as my answer i like it very

1232
01:01:56,809 --> 01:02:01,829
disappointing not at all very disappointing i'm all stressed now i felt really good about
