1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:14,529
On the team side, I've always made sure that you have people from diverse backgrounds, diverse cultures, thinking differently that make up a team.

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:18,429
And I guess I do come from a bit of a sporting background.

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,030
So, you know, I'm kind of quite conscious that you don't want to all have strikers in your team or, you know, full forwards or anything like that.

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,010
Because if you do, you spend your whole time managing the egos.

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,469
So as a leader, I have really enjoyed the creating of diverse teams.

6
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,909
Seeing them thrive and grow has probably been some of the most rewarding parts of my career.

7
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,390
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

8
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,969
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

9
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,590
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse backgrounds in sport, industry, social ventures,

10
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:04,430
and the arts who come together to learn, to connect, and to collaborate.

11
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,390
Dr. Troy Flanagan, Vice President of Performance for the Milwaukee Bucks.

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,390
I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that leadership group.

13
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,590
The significance of their work and how much it's really about helping others.

14
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,969
It made me think, what else could I be doing?

15
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:29,969
And I approached our owner and within a few weeks, we'd raised $5 million to try and solve obesity in the underprivileged community.

16
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:31,090
In Milwaukee.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,750
So that's one spark that that leadership course has caused to contribute and leave the world as a better place.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,010
Umrah Omer, founder of Safari Doctors.

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,129
It defines the word creativity for me.

20
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:49,790
The ability to like see connections where none seem to exist.

21
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,109
And I think that's the magic of Alita.

22
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:58,969
Definitely not my usual, you know, workshop panels like humanitarian spaces.

23
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,549
But more of an interaction.

24
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,750
More of an intentional, um, um, dissection of, uh, leadership.

25
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:09,229

Tyson Ballard is a multifaceted entrepreneur, legal tech innovator, and creative force with a career spanning technology, music, lifestyle, and business transformation.

33
00:02:50,590 --> 00:03:02,229
As the founder and CEO of Stellar Legal, he is revolutionizing how legal teams operate, implementing AI-driven solutions, contract lifecycle management, and legal operation strategies that drive efficiency.

35
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,990
Tyson's creativity extends far beyond the legal world, though.

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:29,069
A lifelong music curator and DJ, he has been at the heart of underground music scenes, blending house, disco, and electronic beats in clubs and events across the globe.

37
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,229
In music, he met his partners, Joe Vidler, and Jason Nicholas.

38
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:45,490
In music, he met his partner, Jeff Alarm, which led him to the creation of AMFE Group, All My Friends Everywhere, a global lifestyle collective that fuses music, art, and travel, crafting immersive experiences that connect people across continents.

39
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:54,710
AMFE is built on the philosophy of extraordinary pleasure, creating one-of-a-kind, mind-blowing events that push the boundaries of imagination and luxury.

40
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,210
AMFE's success led to the creation of a family office investment arm, strategically diversifying into real estate across Europe and Asia.

41
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,889
Tyson 크래mith, Alcymелаshoe, also provides educational and business support for health and disability chois and employment projects, as well as free transportation.

43
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:30,750
Tyson Kremi, the leader of public understandings at Consilio, said he sees it as an opportunity for him to share stories that can help small businesses, net some oil profits, and

44
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,149
land those gaps.

45
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,449
featured in high-fashion campaigns for Valentino and Louis Vuitton,

46
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,629
as well as making their way onto the cover of Playboy magazine.

47
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,689
As a partner in Wavegliders, a surf brand known for its handcrafted boards,

48
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,610
Tyson helped launch a special edition board series

49
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,110
in collaboration with music artist Jose Gonzalez.

50
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,889
Adding to his portfolio, Tyson also founded, with Anthony Dodds,

51
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,029
the cameraman behind some of Deus Ex Machina's finest images,

52

House of Sawa, an eco-resort in the Batacarus Indonesian island

53
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,350
that blends surf culture with sustainable luxury.

54
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,250
And across all his ventures, Tyson is driven by innovation, craftsmanship,

55
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:15,189
teamwork, and community, where he's shaping the future of legal tech,

56
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,310
spinning records in an underground club,

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,209
or crafting experiences that redefine lifestyle and culture.

58
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,230
Tyson, that is an extraordinary life.

59
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,189
And I know you love being in the background,

60
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,990
but we're pushing you out in front today.

61
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,610
I really appreciate you joining me.

62
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,910
Yeah, thanks, Luke.

63
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,310
It's good to be here.

64
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,490
I think you're probably the only person that could get me up this early in the morning.

65
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,930
So, yeah, appreciate you having me on.

66
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,550
And, yeah, definitely feel like shriveling after listening to that intro.

67
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,370
But let's go for it.

68
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,949
Well, mate, it's been hard to pin you down.

69
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,810
And from wherever you've been in the Middle East or the Alps

70
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,269
and doing extraordinary things,

71
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,410
and I mean it since I wanted to read your bio in full

72
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,509
because I'm 180 episodes into recordings.

73
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,569
I've never...

74
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,290
I've never seen anyone with that sort of diversity in their life.

75
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,230
It's extraordinary.

76
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,370
But you grew up in this small town called Wollonga

77
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,209
in the McLaren Vale of South Australia.

78
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,110
You went to primary school with our great mutual friend, Matt Wadowitz,

79
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,149
who co-founded Alita and is the champion of Alita, really.

80
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,310
I've got to ask, you look back growing up in a little country town in SA,

81
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,790
what do you think's been the secret for you to this amazing life around the globe?

82
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,170
Yeah, it's an interesting question, actually.

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,170
I think, I mean, it was a chance...

84
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,410
I've found life, if I think about it, you know,

85
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,509
growing up with Maddie in Wollonga.

86
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,029
I found out pretty quickly that my football career was limited

87
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,209
when I kicked my, I think, a known goal in my first five minutes on the field.

88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,170
Yeah, and I think there was something in me,

89
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,509
even just as a little child, to go out and explore the world.

90
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:55,649
And, you know, I quickly latched on to American culture and films

91
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,529
and, you know, episodes of Seinfeld.

92
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,709
And friends and things like that growing up

93
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,949
that I think always made me want to explore.

94
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,509
And I was pretty lucky enough to have parents that thought the same.

95
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,129
And, you know, we spent a lot of time overseas as a kid,

96
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,990
whether it's in Bali or Europe or Asia.

97
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,850
And, yeah, I think it gave me this curiosity for exploration.

98
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,610
Yeah, that's kind of what led me to leaving as a pretty young kid, I guess,

99
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,490
or teenager.

100
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,810
So those parents sent you to a Steiner school in your secondary education.

101
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,310
Can you explain to people what the Steiner philosophy is?

102
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,930
And do you think that was part of where that curiosity has led you

103
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,730
to do these extraordinary things?

104
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,269
Yeah, 100%.

105
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,649
Actually, I didn't go to school for about a year just leading up to high school,

106
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,189
a bit over, actually.

107
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,889
We were travelling in Europe.

108
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:55,750
And I think my parents coming back thought that maybe going into a state school system,

109
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,230
you know, probably wasn't the best environment.

110
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,810
And I still remember, like, going to the Waldorf school up in Mount Barker

111
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,709
in that outside Adelaide the first time.

112
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,990
I honestly thought it was like an Ewok village.

113
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,410
You know, I thought I was in Caravans of Courage or something like this.

114
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,709
But it was just such a beautiful school in terms of the nature and the buildings

115
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,069
and the architecture and things like that.

116
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:27,089
And I think I pretty much, you know, thrived in that environment.

117
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,069
So the classroom.

118
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:29,230
The rooms are small.

119
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,190
And they have a philosophy where you learn something quite intensely

120
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,309
for a short period of time.

121
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,710
So, you know, it's called a main lesson.

122
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:45,049
And for the first three hours of a day, typically when your brain's the most awake,

123
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,710
you learn for three weeks something really intensively.

124
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,850
And then you move on to the next thing.

125
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,090
But you dive deep into a topic.

126
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,190
Like, we could be learning Romeo and Juliet for three weeks.

127
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,549
And then you compile a document.

128
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,210
A document of everything that you know about Romeo and Juliet

129
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,809
and submit that to the teacher.

130
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,990
And then in the afternoon, you focus more on arts and sport.

131
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,929
You know, when your digestive system is probably starting to slow down,

132
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,409
maybe your energy levels are lower.

133
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,850
And so maybe your cognitive skills aren't there.

134
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,309
But it was definitely an environment where I thrived.

135
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,350
And I don't think it's for everyone.

136
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,490
You know, I also do see,

137
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,950
and I love my dear alumni a lot,

138
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,210
but I do see a big difference between those who have gone through

139
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,450
from kindergarten through to high school

140
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,769
versus those who have kind of, you know, attended some, you know,

141
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,950
state school or, you know, private school

142
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,909
that is different from a Steiner education.

143
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,870
And I do feel really lucky that, you know,

144
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,590
I did participate in the high school arena.

145
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,149
But I think I would have been a different person

146
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,210
if I was there.

147
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,769
I want to dive into that.

148
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,389
You're a father of two yourself.

149
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,610
And we see parents around the world

150
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,710
are often obsessed with the marks.

151
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,450
In Australia, it's your ATAR and the score that you get.

152
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,610
But I think when I've got older,

153
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,769
some of the most creative people and happy people,

154
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,710
one of my closest friends I've had on the podcast,

155
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,710
Craig Ellis School, just wasn't for him,

156
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:21,629
but he's got this brilliant creative brain

157
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,649
that takes him into so many,

158
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,009
reminds me a lot of you actually,

159
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,309
so many creative spaces.

160
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:26,750
So what,

161
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,110
what do you think as a parent,

162
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,049
what's your solution to education?

163
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,830
How do we get it right?

164
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,389
Yeah, that's another good question too.

165
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,330
I actually, my little ones,

166
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,169
not little ones so much anymore.

167
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,590
They're changing schools next year

168
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,169
and they've been at a Swedish school here in Portugal.

169
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,450
And now they're going into a borderline,

170
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,830
I would say kind of private Cambridge education,

171
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,169
but maybe with a slight Steiner twist to it.

172
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:56,710
So I've been,

173
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,710
I've been delving a bit deeper into the curriculum

174
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,370
and things like that.

175
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,549
And I think probably in the world that I live in,

176
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:06,210
which is quite an AI led environment,

177
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,409
I'm quite worried about setting up our kids for future success.

178
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,110
You know,

179
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,549
like, you know,

180
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:15,429
five years ago it was like everyone should learn how to code,

181
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,149
but by the time that these guys are finishing school,

182
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,669
there will be no coding.

183
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:20,450
And, but,

184
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,570
but what I am kind of deeply worried about is that the

185
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,490
curriculum,

186
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,950
you know,

187
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,090
hasn't really changed since,

188
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:29,950
you know,

189
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,950
incremental change really since,

190
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,470
you know,

191
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,169
the twenties or thirties and the idea of them,

192
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:35,750
you know,

193
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,690
sitting in a four by four you know,

194
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,309
concrete box for six or seven hours of the day and,

195
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:43,590
you know,

196
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,950
write it on a blackboard and copy it into your book.

197
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,990
And now you learn.

198
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,649
I think it's obviously progressed since those days.

199
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,230
And now it's a lot more,

200
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:52,710
you know,

201
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,149
interactive learning.

202
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,710
The kids are learning at their own pace and things like that.

203
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,990
But I guess my fear is that it hasn't changed as quick

204
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,870
as probably the outside world has,

205
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,830
but I think you need to supplement that with the parenting,

206
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,149
right.

207
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,149
Which is probably,

208
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:07,590
you know,

209
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,350
teaching them,

210
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:08,710
you know,

211
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,350
critical thinking and adaptability and exposing them to,

212
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,210
to kind of different cultures and,

213
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,629
and,

214
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,889
and different things and,

215
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:18,210
and,

216
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,330
and travel does that.

217
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:19,629
And,

218
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,769
and as you know,

219
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,149
we spend a lot of time on the road,

220
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:22,870
but yeah,

221
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,789
like it does worry me.

222
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:25,090
And,

223
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,470
and I,

224
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,710
and I wonder if,

225
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:29,289
if the whole education system at some point,

226
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,289
maybe it needs a little,

227
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,730
it's its own doge system where,

228
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,090
you know,

229
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,870
it goes in and,

230
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,610
and gets shaken up and kind of,

231
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:36,909
you know,

232
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,090
with a blank sheet of paper.

233
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:39,870
What do you think you've got?

234
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:40,590
You got two,

235
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,269
two empty nesters and,

236
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:43,029
and,

237
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,730
and I,

238
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,649
I know our kids have spent time with yours.

239
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,669
Is it like the beautiful kids?

240
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:47,970
Like,

241
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,590
you know,

242
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,990
what was your kid a success?

243
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,370
Yeah,

244
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:50,830
it's a good,

245
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,370
it's a great return question,

246
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,250
Tyson.

247
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,110
And it's something that Beck and I thought about deeply.

248
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:56,490
And I,

249
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:56,789
I,

250
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,549
you know,

251
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,350
looked at the Steiner and the alternative to me,

252
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,950
the one thing in the world that needs disruption is education.

253
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,649
Almost everything else has been disrupted.

254
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,049
And,

255
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,769
and with you,

256
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:09,149
sometimes there's a sadness when I look at kids and you open the textbook

257
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:09,590
and you're right.

258
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,669
It hasn't changed.

259
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,610
The right learning still there.

260
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:12,889
And,

261
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,730
and you know,

262
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,129
there's a,

263
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,950
the number one Ted talk in the world is about schools,

264
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,809
killing creativity.

265
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:19,870
And I think as parents,

266
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,250
you get to see little parts of that creativity die in your kids.

267
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,470
And I think probably exactly what you said is how do you keep that alive in

268
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,389
your own home?

269
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,710
How do you give them experiences?

270
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,590
How do you potentially travel with them or be around them enough that you can

271
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:32,909
do that?

272
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:37,710
Because there's also the stability of supporting your kids in their passions.

273
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,129
If they,

274
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,570
as a pretty sporting focused.

275
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,090
And so,

276
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:40,730
yeah,

277
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,950
I love brains like yours that didn't have the necessarily the regular

278
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,909
education.

279
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,350
I can see the genius in,

280
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,049
in,

281
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,789
in something like yours,

282
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,129
which is,

283
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,429
you know,

284
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,029
there's so many questions to jump off.

285
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,850
I want to come back to AI because I'm fascinated in your thoughts on AI,

286
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:56,309
but,

287
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,990
but I look at you and I know you had this,

288
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,149
this brilliant mass brain.

289
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,389
You still have got a brilliant mass brain and a brilliant music brain.

290
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,909
Very few people on the planet,

291
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,389
I think get them working at the same time.

292
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,809
Did you always feel like that was a bit of your superpower that you had these

293
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,370
two really different ways of thinking?

294
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:12,289
Yeah.

295
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,590
Like actually I think mathematics is quite similar to,

296
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,870
there is a lot of mathematics in music.

297
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,409
And I mean,

298
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,649
I come from a like percussion and drum background.

299
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,450
I,

300
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,289
I have always,

301
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,950
I have always loved this combination of I kind of think about it and I don't

302
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,870
know if it's right or not,

303
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,309
but the,

304
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,529
the right brain and the left brain and,

305
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,549
and kind of,

306
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,870
you know,

307
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,570
challenging both to kind of,

308
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:38,870
you know,

309
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,370
operate in equal,

310
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,309
in equal measure.

311
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,309
And yeah,

312
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,549
like I've,

313
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,190
I've just always enjoyed maths in,

314
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:48,509
in,

315
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,309
in that the you're solving a problem essentially.

316
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:53,090
And,

317
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,350
and it's got an answer and I love getting to the answer.

318
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,690
It's,

319
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,289
it's like a,

320
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,590
a choose your own adventure.

321
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:58,409
And,

322
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,929
and obviously I went kind of pretty deep into statistics,

323
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:01,529
but,

324
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:02,090
and then,

325
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,370
you know,

326
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,990
applying that to,

327
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:04,230
to,

328
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,570
to rhythms you know,

329
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:06,950
on,

330
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,490
on the musical side and,

331
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,450
and as a drummer,

332
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,070
you know,

333
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,309
you,

334
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,190
you learn a lot about time signatures and things like that.

335
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,929
And it is quite mathematical.

336
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,389
Obviously it's physical because you've got lots of things going at,

337
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:18,870
at,

338
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,950
at one time.

339
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:21,269
And I,

340
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,470
and I've always just somehow just loved that challenge.

341
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:24,990
You know,

342
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,309
my dad was a drummer,

343
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:28,230
my grandpa was a drummer.

344
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,269
So,

345
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,950
and now my kids are learning drums,

346
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,190
which is hilarious.

347
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,529
It's,

348
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,629
it's a very antisocial instrument to learn in the house.

349
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,370
I'll tell you that.

350
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:42,250
But I think it's a good foundation of kind of maybe applying some of the

351
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,090
mathematics that you learn about other in school,

352
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,450
or if you do have a curiosity to kind of,

353
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,669
you know,

354
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,850
take it further and you know,

355
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,610
still have a something where you can collaborate with others in,

356
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,730
in things like a band.

357
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:55,850
Tyson,

358
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,850
you've done so many interesting things and I didn't do it justice at all in,

359
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,450
in the intro,

360
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,909
but all my friends every year,

361
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,490
I'm so curious about how you landed on that.

362
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,169
Can you share a bit about some of the events that you hold and some of the

363
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:08,950
creativity that,

364
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,490
that world is,

365
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:11,210
is opened up?

366
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:12,149
Yeah,

367
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,750
it's such a beautiful project.

368
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,129
You know,

369
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:19,149
it's with two of my dearest friends and,

370
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,629
and actually the sparked off by,

371
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,330
by chef,

372
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,629
the chef and I actually had an electronic band.

373
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,850
We played together about 15 years ago and for one hot summer we toured the world.

374
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,509
I think our first gig was after rehearsing in the kitchen was about to 15,000 people.

375
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:38,730
And so yeah.

376
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,730
And but since then we've always remained great friends and you know,

377
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,090
he always dreamt big.

378
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,090
So chef was always the guy that,

379
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,690
you know,

380
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,409
if he would always have time for you and if he had,

381
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,929
if he had a hundred bucks,

382
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,730
the hundred bucks was for everybody.

383
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,330
And so,

384
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,889
you know,

385
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,169
he,

386
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:54,529
he,

387
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:54,970
you know,

388
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,129
he,

389
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:55,649
you know,

390
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:25,630
he was there for everybody no matter what and and he was very lucky enough just before COVID to meet a very high net individual that basically said you know can you help me organize a party for Halloween and I think in our true fashion you know like a party to us means you know spend I don't know like a thousand bucks get all our mates together and have a great weekend where this had quite a much bigger impact on my life.

391
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,650
So yeah I think that was a really good thing.

392
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,650
And it was a really good thing.

393
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,650
Yeah.

394
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,650
And I think chef just took it in his stride and you know he ended up renting a castle outside England.

395
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,650
I had like I think kind of imagine eyes wide shut meets you know an electronic grave and you can use your imagination to kind of see where it went.

396
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,650
But essentially that sparked AMFE.

397
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,650
Yeah.

398
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,650
And it kind of snowballed from there.

399
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,650
We're now like nearly six years on.

400
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,650
We have around a hundred and fifty people there.

401
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,650
And so it was a really good thing.

402
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,650
I mean,

403
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,650
you know,

404
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,650
you know,

405
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,650
it's a really good thing.

406
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,650
You know,

407
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,650
we're a family of people and we've had a lot of fun.

408
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,650
And I think chef was really,

409
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,650
you know,

410
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,650
he was a great guy.

411
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,650
He was a great guy.

412
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,650
And essentially that sparked AMFE.

413
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,650
Yeah.

414
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,470
And it kind of snowballed from there.

415
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,210
We're now like nearly six years on.

416
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,690
We have around about a hundred and fifty staff.

417
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,690
You know,

418
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,529
we've done some pretty incredible events.

419
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,410
So maybe about a year and a half,

420
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,410
two years ago,

421
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:12,769
they broke the world record for the longest private flight whilst having a party in the air.

422
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:13,769
So we,

423
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,650
I think it was a 767 that we,

424
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:23,910
we customized um so we took all the all the seats out um and build a dj booth and nightclub inside

425
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:31,990
the inside the jet and flew from uh bangkok thailand to bogota um columbia and um unbeknownst

426
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,250
to us at the halfway through it at that kind of middle point the the pilot came on and said um

427
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,410
look this is my my final private flight of my career so i wanted to go for the record so we've

428
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:52,089
we've passed the no return zone so uh here we go and you can imagine the the the the crowd erupting

429
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:58,210
in in the jet you know like uh to hearing that like whilst uh listening to some of the best djs

430
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:04,670
in the world and yeah thankfully they landed uh you know in bogota safely and then just recently

431
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:12,569
we we we organized an event for about 25 000 people in in the pyramids in outside in cairo

432
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:20,230
coincided on my birthday which was a really nice event um but yeah i think it was the first

433
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:27,869
event as close as to the pyramids since shakira in 2006 or something like that so you can imagine

434
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:34,210
all the all the bureaucracy and all the all the uh workarounds we had to get to get there but

435
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,269
you know we're i guess we're behind some of you know some of the biggest events and probably some

436
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,210
of the more creative events we don't tend to do the you know the run of the mill

437
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:51,430
find a field and and stick up a stage and and uh and have an event we always look to challenge

438
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:58,630
right now we're we're looking to have the first party in space um and so yeah we're having having

439
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,509
some interesting conversations i think we're competing against lady gaga at the moment to

440
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,170
try and get there but uh yeah let's see how we go it's never boring having a conversation with you

441
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,390
it goes off in a direction i love it i mean who who's thinking that that's even possible

442
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,730
and you know you can imagine the the fun and that's what it seems like it's just fun being

443
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,349
around you i look at the to me the definition of the entrepreneurial spirit i'm looking at it on

444
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:29,089
the screen i'm looking at in portugal today what do you think about when you get go down that path

445
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:33,890
and have you got advice for others that want to maybe take on the same path as you it's been an

446
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:40,230
interesting journey and i don't think you ever really set out to maybe deliberately be an

447
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,430
entrepreneur or you know wonder about my younger self what what advice i would give to my younger

448
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:54,730
self kind of and i guess that kind of is similar question and you know i think everything that i've

449
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:01,890
done has kind of led me to to where i've got to now and and and i think my advice is you know i've

450
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,069
listened to a bunch of your podcasts as well where you know like you've got a lot of guys that come on

451
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:12,609
that you know find one thing that they're great at you know have the drive and discipline to kind

452
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,390
of focus on that um and and i think that's a really good question and i think that's a really good

453
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,890
and and do amazing things and you know world champions and things like that and and that

454
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,309
that's that's amazing and you know even in my leader group there was you know guys like amit

455
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:31,750
and troy who were and and vanessa as well who were just like you know amazing um human beings

456
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,190
but um i think probably mine has been a little bit different it hasn't been a you know a single

457
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,390
trajectory and and i guess the advice is that's okay too you can still have um success

458
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,369
you know success can maybe be defined in a different way um for you it doesn't need to be

459
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:55,670
gold medals or you know a single career or i think like that and and i kind of have enjoyed the

460
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:04,670
process of of being curious about many things um maybe i'm a master of none i'm not sure but um

461
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,509
but either which way i've had a lot of fun along the way and um and you know in in terms of success

462
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,369
happy family um you know you know i've had a lot of fun along the way and um and you know

463
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:20,269
living a wonderful colorful life like i i think i've definitely have had it and and i think

464
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:25,130
probably maybe the other just the other piece of advice is like i felt like every step of the way

465
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,130
i've been where i'm meant to be um you know i you know it hasn't always been a bed of roses

466
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:37,430
um you know like i've i've taken lessons that i've learned along the way that now you know i

467
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:43,210
think there's kind of that that theory of 10 000 hours maybe i've spent you know 50 000 hours on

468
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,349
on six or seven hours and i've had a lot of fun along the way and i think that's kind of the

469
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:44,390
thing i've had a lot of fun along the way and i think that's kind of the thing

470
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,309
and things so i i don't know if i subscribe to kind of you know you really need that 10 000

471
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:55,230
hours to to be successful at one thing curiosity and drive maybe yeah it's interesting malcolm

472
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,650
gladwell was the author of the the 10 000 hour rule and i think he's actually gone back and

473
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,609
revisited that and said you know what i don't actually agree with my own thinking uh if i

474
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:08,849
look back 10 years later it's uh there's a great book called range which talks about exactly you

475
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:14,349
so the people that sample a range of different things end up building a skill set in in a

476
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:18,710
in a whole heap of different areas and you did mention a leader and we've been so privileged

477
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,490
tyson to have you as a great creative thinker in that world and you mentioned some of your group

478
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,769
we love the idea of bringing together uh people from different backgrounds in this sort of learning

479
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:33,470
and sharing environment um can you explain what the elita connect group's been like for you

480
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:40,970
oh mate like i remember about was it five or six years ago when we sat at your pub in in melbourne

481
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,329
and and talked about this idea about bringing some of the

482
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:49,650
the best leaders in the world together and i think that was kind of a pivotal moment

483
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:57,710
where i was just like this is just such a golden idea and just to see that you guys um you know

484
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:03,690
deliver on that is just been amazing and and i guess as a mate of maddie i've just been so

485
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,470
so proud of everything you guys have done at elita in terms of the group that i had like

486
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,589
from the very first session with troy amit

487
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:20,549
and hugh was there as well and and vanessa um it was it was really really interesting because i

488
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:27,609
think um you know very quickly you know we did our obligatory introductions you know rattled off

489
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,869
all the achievements that we've had in life and i think it was you that just started immediately

490
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:39,849
talking about his kids and then it just broke down the the whole sessions from then onwards

491
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:44,329
that set a tone i guess that that made us all a lot more vulnerable and i think that's what i'm

492
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:51,049
to to talk about some of the challenges and like proper challenges that we're having in in in work

493
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,829
and life um and for me it was i mean it was definitely life-changing you know seeing troy

494
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:03,609
and and vanessa kind of having these pivotal moments in their career and and also seeing

495
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:08,670
the things that amit delivered at the bulldogs last year in terms of the you know the new facility and

496
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,329
whilst also same as you delivering a renovation on his house which uh you know we've had a lot of

497
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:21,569
which is double whammy yeah i i really felt like so privileged to be involved um quite often

498
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:26,710
you know a little bit of imposter syndrome um thinking about some of the achievements that

499
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,789
these guys have had and and and the world that they're living in um but yeah it was life-changing

500
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:39,549
i mean i i during that month that was the moment that you know like really cemented me to kind of

501
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:44,309
you know jump off and and start stellar um you know

502
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:50,450
with the with the guidance and support of those guys and i'm really proud to say that you know

503
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,569
that i count them as dear friends and you know there's a lot of banter on the whatsapp group

504
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:02,789
whether it's you know try it at the box in terms of you know winning or losing and you know i meet

505
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:08,069
um having some of the challenges uh you know not making it to the to the grand final last year

506
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:13,250
and things like that and yeah it's it's just been such a wonderful experience

507
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,369
and tyce i remember that beer very well and and it's interesting when you've got an idea and matt

508
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:24,109
is the absolute creator behind it and i've been lucky enough to be associated with your great

509
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:28,849
friend and my great friend he's a he's a one-of-a-kind person and um i haven't met too

510
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:32,869
many like him to be honest with you and it's based on his uh he's great thinking but i love sitting

511
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:37,390
down with you because you just tell you're a great ideas person and all you saw is possibility

512
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,930
yeah and you ask some awesome questions it's interesting it's quite often you know

513
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,490
when you share an idea with people i reckon 90 of people go the other way and tell you why it's a

514
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,470
stupid idea and tell you why you shouldn't do it and tell you how hard it's going to be and how

515
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,130
hard a path it is so it's uh it's a rare thing someone like you and it's why it's a great story

516
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,849
to share there's a lot of people that are probably going down a university path they've got no idea

517
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:04,910
what they want to do their parents are wanting them to do something safe for or secure but i

518
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,490
think you're a great living example to me of of someone who just followed their passion just takes

519
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,049
it all away and loves you and and maybe even be left for some reason i don't know what exactly

520
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:25,009
do others feel uh it would be a moment to concede but instead i i think it's a well-resinterpreted

521
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:30,609
way of telling people that you know it's not how they go to campus you could literally walk

522
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:37,329
under someone's roof and say hey i'm going to be driving kind of like i'm dancing you know

523
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:42,609
like you know what like every group i've served too many yes or no people will want to take up

524
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:43,089
that call

525
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:43,170
an NG

526
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,250
uh

527
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:50,569
can do today there's no doubt that this is a you know a proper industrial revolution moment in in

528
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,309
history in terms of where we are with ai and there's no doubt that probably for the first

529
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:01,309
time in humanity especially given the leap from machine learning to generative um you know when

530
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:06,069
chat gpt was introduced and and kind of you know everyone jumped on that for the first time there's

531
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:12,930
probably a lot of brilliant minds focused on um making it better and finding use cases and

532
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:19,490
and um obviously probably looking to get rich in at the same time no doubt it's going to have an

533
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:29,470
impact on on the workforce i probably spend at least 30 hours a week talking about ai to clients

534
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,670
and i don't go into one phone call where um you know with a with a potential client or an existing

535
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:41,829
client where ai is not mentioned now if i cast my time back to two three years ago it wasn't like

536
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:42,910
that it was more

537
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,750
around data and you know some of the kind of like maybe some more of the kind of process

538
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:54,710
orientated challenges but yeah i think across every single realm um from sport to creative

539
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:04,970
to to business to to finance to um to health to to education i think there's just a wonderful

540
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,349
opportunity to enrich the lives if we um use it in the right way but then also it's scary

541
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:21,670
it's it's a bit of a um you know out of control uh bucking bronco that um you know if we don't

542
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:27,849
you know approach it in the right way could be potentially harmful towards uh you know

543
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:35,509
towards humans and so yeah i think we need to approach it with um you know some care and some

544
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:42,710
thought and and thinking about you know how we use it to enrich the lives um you know i feel like

545
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:52,210
you know having this this untapped you know limitless knowledge is a very powerful tool um

546
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:59,650
and we just need to make sure that we apply it in the right way but i am incredibly excited about it

547
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:05,670
obviously i've built a business around it you know i i love right now being able to find kind

548
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,750
of you know today what are the practical applications of it and especially in in the

549
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,910
field of work that i've kind of you know that i've focused on you know i've focused on the

550
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,970
are you playing around with it in in your daily life are there things that you now do that

551
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,269
chat gbt is is the obvious uh place to go or is there other sort of micro things that you're

552
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,750
already saying that are that are working for it yeah like so i mean stellar the company we

553
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:36,109
founded a couple of months ago um we're partners with a with a bunch of um kind of leading

554
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,910
ai tools for for legal they're focused predominantly around um you know i guess

555
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:49,490
you know making the practice of law uh more efficient uh whether it's contracts or knowledge

556
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:56,289
or research or or some of the kind of the more the process and kind of um you know like uh

557
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:01,690
workflow orientated um tasks most of the organizations when you when you're talking

558
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:08,569
about law it's quite a private um environment obviously you're dealing with um privileged and

559
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:12,910
and um highly confidential information that a lot of the people that are involved in the

560
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:19,890
world don't tend to go towards chat gbt however i would um hazard a bet that nearly all of them

561
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,829
are going it's chat gbt and in terms of kind of their their own um you know their own environment

562
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:30,789
and and i guess like i've always been fascinated that law has been a bit of the last

563
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:38,069
the last bastion of uh adoption for technology you know the mystification of what lawyers do

564
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:42,809
and i'm sure you've dealt with a few in your day um you know it's it's quite it's

565
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,210
quite smoke and mirrors in fact you know if you think about it and being able to kind of

566
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:54,529
enrich that environment with ai is uh something that is you know is incredibly challenging but

567
00:31:54,529 --> 00:32:00,289
also incredibly rewarding if you think about like uh the happiness levels of of lawyers

568
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:08,309
it's an environment that is probably one of the most unhappy um work uh mental states um

569
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:12,349
and you know if we can do something that makes

570
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:12,910
the

571
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:21,109
practice of law more happy um then um and more efficient um then then and i feel like we've done

572
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:32,710
our job we all are born different as we grow the experiences we have developed into outlooks

573
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:43,970
uniquely our own charting our life's course no one sees an idea opinion or opportunity like you

574
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:51,670
and no one sees you like value victoria university uniquely you

00:32:51,670 --> 00:33:00,309
hi my name's min i do a bachelor of social work i got this tattoo done for my 20th birthday present

576
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:06,170
because i was born as a twin but she passed away because my mom had ovarian cancer during pregnancy

577
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:12,910
so my name's miri indy which means rainbow and it means the bridge between um for our ancestors to

578
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,190
reach like their afterlife and i'm a member of a group called the rainbow and i'm a member of the

579
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,589
which is what my sister was called which is the water putty which is the milky way

580
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:21,210
and that's where they go as like the stars and they live they live there

581
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,250
the thing is very supportive it doesn't matter if you're an indigenous student

582
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,529
wouldn't i bother to make sure that you're very well taken care of

583
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:35,769
at alita our signature program alita connect is something we're really passionate and proud of

584
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:40,869
we bring together groups of five to six people around the globe from diverse backgrounds sport

585
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,190
industry social venture and the arts we come together to learn and we're very proud of that

586
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:50,109
to connect and to collaborate vanessa ford chief operating officer at kukua the alita connect

587
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:56,549
experience for me has been transformational i met people that i would never have met from

588
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:02,670
totally different spheres it's very basic it's all about relationships it's all about how we

589
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:08,590
communicate and what the alita connect group does that is so powerful is when you bring two people

590
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:14,070
from two totally different worlds together there's no ego it just

591
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:21,030
leaves room for for the real you and i think that's what alita gave me was bringing back the

592
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:28,110
real me and and really connecting to my own leadership style loving uh the opportunity to

593
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,050
sit down with people like you and delve into their thinking and we've got these uh patterns that

594
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,690
we've seen across uh the work we do at alita and and starting with self um leadership um what what's

595
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,909
the way you fill your cup up in the busy life that you've got is there a routine or something

596
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,190
you go through and how do you fill your cup up and how do you fill your cup up and how do you

597
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:52,050
to make sure you're feeling your best in terms of routines well i've got my my cup of um uh coffee

598
00:34:52,050 --> 00:35:00,090
right here mate um so yeah i i tend to start my day with a good cup of coffee um i'm i wouldn't

599
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,929
say i'm the earliest riser in the house like typically the kids are up before me because i'm

600
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:12,630
a lot on the road um and it's a lot of late nights and early flights i really rely heavily on a lot

601
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,889
of vitamins so i'm a little bit more of a go-do to make sure i'm feeling my best in terms of routines

602
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:22,050
so you know amiga i take a lot of mushroom paul stemmet um immunity um tablets um and and pine

603
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,469
bark extract and and you know i think i probably have a regime around about 60 vitamins that i take

604
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:36,090
every morning well and uh and a good cup of coffee um and uh yeah that tends to keep me energetic

605
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:42,690
i am quite conscious also this is something we chatted about at alita around balancing energy

606
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,869
levels and and not you know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't

607
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,329
know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i'm not expanding all of my energy

608
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:53,110
um in the in the work life um and ensuring that you know i'm i'm there and and still energetic at

609
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,769
the end of the day when the kids finish school or you know when they're playing a bunch of tennis

610
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:03,670
at the moment so you know even after that and and and same for once the kids are in bed can't say

611
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,989
i always do the the best job at that one that uh you know i definitely kind of it's something i

612
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:13,869
think about and i'm not conscious about and i think probably recognizing those moments and

613
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:37,309
where you really need high energy, whether through my calendar, like, you know, there's probably about five or six meetings that, you know, I really need to nail in a week that the rest, you know, I can probably kind of operate on, you know, 70, 80% energy levels. And just, I guess the conscious, you know, maintaining of those energy levels is something that I kind of focus on.

614
00:36:37,309 --> 00:37:02,050
Fascinating way. I'm not surprised you think about it differently. I haven't heard anyone answer that around. You can maybe have an idea of what you need and there's six key things for the week that you want to be a hundred percent on and saving energy for your kids is a fascinating way to think about it. And yeah, I haven't heard anyone answer in that way before, but it makes sense when I think about exactly how you're living.

615
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:07,289
Is there one thing that you've always done as a leader that you never would change in any of the,

616
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,690
disciplines you've been involved in?

617
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:36,670
First of all, on the team side, I've always made sure that, um, you have people from diverse backgrounds, diverse cultures, um, thinking differently that, you know, that, that make up a team. And I guess I, I, I do come from a bit of a sporting background. So, you know, I'm kind of quite conscious that you don't want to all have strikers in your team or, you know, full forwards or anything like that. Um, cause if you do, you spend your whole time managing the egos.

618
00:37:37,309 --> 00:38:07,289
So as a leader, um, I have really enjoyed the creating of diverse teams, you know, um, and, um, I think that is something that I've, I've really enjoyed. And, and I think seeing them thrive and grow is probably been some of the most rewarding, um, parts of, of my career. Um, and, um, yeah. And I think probably the other one is to, to see them thrive and grow, you really need to have great leadership.

619
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:37,289
Um, and you need to empower them. Um, I think you need to have honest conversations, um, in terms of their performance and, you know, where they can improve, but that should be done in a constructive way. But, you know, a lot of these things you tend to forget about, um, you know, once you're kind of busy running a business and you've got all the pressures of, of performance. Um, so yeah, so I would say, yeah, listening skills, um, diverse teams and, uh, empowering them.

620
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:39,489
Um, to kind of, you know, be the best that they can be.

621
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:47,690
Have you got a story of a visionary leader that's inspired you in the past and you felt compelled to, to follow their vision in any of the things you've done?

622
00:38:47,969 --> 00:39:04,969
Yeah, I've been really lucky enough to, to work for many, um, or work alongside many and, and, and seen many. If I, if I was to say one, probably a pivotal one is a guy called John Ramage. I think he even played a couple of games for Carlton back in the day.

623
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:05,010
Okay.

624
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,969
But, um, really early.

625
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:36,929
Early on in my career, I, I worked at Westpac, um, in, and as a collections, uh, team leader, which was really, really fascinating. And, um, and, and our, and our boss of, of, uh, Westpac was this guy called John Ramage. Um, he's a footy coach, but he, he really installed in me, know your numbers. So we used to have these meetings and, uh, if you've ever worked in a call center, you know, it's a, it's a pretty surreal experience.

626
00:39:37,309 --> 00:40:06,030
But, you know, you've got to pick up the phone within 30 seconds. No one really calls you if they're happy. So usually they're, um, pretty unhappy and either they don't want to speak to you or things like that. And we were collecting, you know, credit card debt, mortgage debt and things like that. So it wasn't really the most, um, happy environment to, to deal with. But what it made it really, you know, exhilarating and, and to me was that, that the numbers side of things. So we used to have these weekly meetings.

627
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,329
Okay.

628
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:34,989
You would be absolutely, um, you know, roasted. And, and I think, you know, going into those meetings and, and, you know, spending the time to kind of really dig into the numbers of the performance of your team was quite, quite an interesting one. And that's probably something that I kind of took with me. And, and he just installed a bit of a discipline that, you know, it, it actually wasn't okay to be mediocre. Um, and I think when you're, when you're a youngster, those kinds of things are quite pivotal.

629
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,289
Just having that, you know, know your numbers.

630
00:40:37,309 --> 00:41:07,309
You know, he, he was quite big on, on, on the grammar side as well. So if you ever came to a presentation that didn't, you know, wasn't polished and didn't have a full stop or, you know, the, the formatting was, was all wrong. You know, he was quite strict, but it worked for me because I think I'd probably come out of this Steiner environment. Right. Which was, I don't, I can't even remember anything about getting taught about grammar or anything like that. But so, yeah. And, and for me, that was really early on where, you know, I, I kind of, you know, I, I kind of, you know, I, I kind of, I, I kind of, you know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

631
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:13,409
saw the power of leadership and I think there was a bunch of leaders that came out of that

632
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:20,250
business that have gone on to do great things. I'm pretty sure the next CEO of Westpac is going

633
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:25,329
to come from that group. It's fascinating, isn't it? I love that impact, isn't it, of someone that

634
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:30,610
has obviously stayed in your mind all these years and had an impact and it's the little

635
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:35,150
bits of leadership that stand out. You strike me as inherently curious in everything you do.

636
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,670
Do you actually carve out time in your day to be curious and can I ask how do you

637
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:47,389
implement that into the things that you do? I am incredibly curious. I probably read about

638
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:54,829
five or six books a week, mainly on Audible, but I do spend a lot of time on planes.

639
00:41:55,469 --> 00:42:03,949
So my time to be curious on the book side is on planes and that is a time where

640
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,590
quite often internet doesn't work so people can't get in contact with you

641
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:17,389
and so it is a bit of a time for yourself and so I do maximize that. I do carve out time for

642
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:23,630
myself as well, whether it's in the morning, taking the dog for a walk. I kind of dive deep

643
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:33,130
into topics and I've rediscovered my love for tennis. So I'm spending about two hours a day

644
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,050
playing tennis, which is something...

645
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:42,190
You really need to be present for and I'm really enjoying having something that isn't digital

646
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,570
where I can kind of focus on, be present. It's physical, it's cognitive, it's incredibly

647
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,550
frustrating, but then also incredibly rewarding. And I've been really enjoying kind of the journey

648
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:59,989
of even as a much more senior individual, trying to kind of get better at something.

649
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:04,769
But yeah, I definitely kind of carve time out of my day every single day.

650
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,250
To do something that is new, essentially.

651
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:14,750
I've got to get a book recommendation from someone who's consuming the amount of books you are on an

652
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,369
annual basis. So what's the one, if you're going to recommend one to our audience, what should we

653
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:20,630
read?

654
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:27,650
I've just finished reading two really amazing books. I can't remember the author, but one was

655
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:35,090
called Chasing the Scream, which is about the history of the war on drugs. And it's told,

656
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:42,429
told in a story format. And it's, it's just fascinating what, what governments have done

657
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:48,170
and how it started. And, and, you know, like experiments like, like Portugal, for example,

658
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,909
that decriminalized everything, you know, nearly 30 years ago now. And then, you know, from,

659
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,309
you know, some of the terrible, you know, things that are happening in Canada and the US in terms

660
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:04,889
of drug addiction, it's like that. That was a truly fascinating book.

661
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:12,969
And then the other one I would say is Prisoners of Geography, which is more of a geopolitical book

662
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:19,869
around, and it kind of goes back, you know, up to a thousand years and kind of delves into the,

663
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:25,550
I guess, the history of power and geography. And, you know, for example, how did a tiny little

664
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:32,489
island, you know, off the coast of Europe become such a powerful country? And, you know, why hasn't

665
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:35,130
Africa kind of, you know, capitalized on, on drugs?

666
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:40,690
Being, you know, so minerally rich and, and things like that. So I found that fascinating as well.

667
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:46,489
You've sparked my curiosity on both of those. We're a bit obsessed with collaboration. Is there,

668
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,809
it seems like you've got plenty of great collaboration in their life. Is there one

669
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:59,230
that jumps out at you? Yeah. I mean, probably AMFE is just a really exciting collaboration.

670
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:03,889
If you were to spend time with the three of us, maybe as a fly on the wall,

671
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,130
you'd be like,

672
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:11,769
what are these guys talking about? You know, like you can not do that, but somehow we always

673
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:18,769
make it happen. We've done some just things where, you know, like, you know, I, even I didn't think

674
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:23,590
it was possible. And, and I think, you know, thriving off that energy that, you know, that,

675
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:30,150
I guess that lifts you up to unlock some of that human potential. And I can, I think you can only

676
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,789
get that through, you know, bouncing off ideas and,

677
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:40,369
and helping each other step on, you know, to get to the next level. Yeah. So I would say,

678
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:48,429
you know, the collaboration on, on AMFE is a big one. Right now we're, we, we're trying to

679
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:56,210
reinvent the, the Nile cruise. So after, after Egypt, we, you know, we spent some time on the

680
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:02,170
Nile and we were like, you know, I think this Nile cruise situation could be done a hell of a lot

681
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,130
better. So we're exploring a project.

682
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:11,250
Around, you know, taking the Nile cruises to the next level, which is really exciting,

683
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:17,869
really challenging and a long way from home, but, you know, spending time collaborating

684
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,150
with locals on that one and, and, you know, thinking about what is the art of the possible

685
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:29,809
there. I'm, I'm really looking forward to kind of redefining, you know, luxury and experience

686
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:33,909
on the Nile, which is just such a magical and historical place.

687
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,130
That sounds like it.

688
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:41,349
A trip to, to find your way onto, I mean, you've got 150 staff in, in AMFE. You've had

689
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:45,789
legal businesses all around the world and, and, and home base in South Africa.

690
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,150
How do you go about your communication when you're running so many different spaces? Have you got a

691
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:56,809
mantra that you think about with communication? I think when, when you're living in, in an

692
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:04,929
environment where nearly everyone is remote, you need to find ways that bring that personal,

693
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:15,389
just real local, personal kind of touch or personal interaction or water cooler conversations

694
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:16,809
into your daily life.

695
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:24,010
And so I think in the beginning of all of this, I tried to have a lot of more, just meetings

696
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:29,230
were, were more of social occasion and that didn't really work. So, so now actually I

697
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:34,570
spend, for nearly every meeting, you know, 10 to 15 minutes just, shooting the breeze

698
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:47,170
And I think if you live in this environment where, you know, pretty much my life is, if I'm not playing tennis or surfing, it's 30-minute Zoom conversations or Teams conversations, you know, back to back.

699
00:47:47,170 --> 00:48:06,289
And so, yeah, so I've had to find a way to find that personal connection with my team that you probably find at the local pub afterwards that you can't get when they're sitting in Buenos Aires or, you know, or Bogota.

700
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:13,329
And so, yeah, so finding that, you know, personal digital connection has been really important.

701
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:16,869
I mean, carving out time in the meetings to ask about family.

702
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:24,309
Or a football game or, you know, the wedding or the holiday or something like that has been really important.

703
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,150
And then, obviously, WhatsApp because I've got so many things on the go.

704
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:38,289
There's quite, you know, especially for my business partners, you know, there's time for banter, but then there's also time for quick decisions and quick conversations.

705
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:46,550
So, I found, you know, the phone is an incredibly useful tool that allows you to kind of work from anywhere.

706
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:52,469
But you just couldn't do, you know, 10 years ago or something like that, you know.

707
00:48:53,110 --> 00:49:00,750
Then maybe probably the final one is you really just have to make time to go visit and spend time with these people in one place.

708
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:13,849
So, for example, on the Stella side, you know, we've just come from, you know, a week in Sarasota, Florida, where we all chased alligators around a golf course and found out that your golf ball goes anywhere near the water.

709
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:15,489
You should not go get that golf ball.

710
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:26,030
So, yeah, like just like, you know, finding those times where you can get together and do things socially is really important too.

711
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:32,170
And even if you can't do that every day, finding a couple of times a year that you can kind of all get together.

712
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:34,030
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

713
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,269
Who has been the greatest leader in my life?

714
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:46,190
I mean, I touched on John Ramage earlier on, and I probably think the other one would be a lady called Claire O'Brien.

715
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:51,210
She's now the CEO of Deutsche Bank for the legal.

716
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,949
And we worked together at the world's biggest law firm, Clifford Chance.

717
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,570
And basically they took a chance on me.

718
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,530
You know, I was a sailor at the time.

719
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,090
And they were like, Tice, we really like you.

720
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,369
We don't really know what you do, but we really want you to come and just try and shift the needle here at this law firm.

721
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:16,530
And without the support of her and her girlfriend.

722
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:24,889
And without the guidance and the time that she spent to kind of introduce me to the world of legal, I wouldn't be where I am today.

723
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:25,730
That's for sure.

724
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,070
She is a force of nature.

725
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:35,269
Quite often people say, if you want to storm the hill, you call Claire O'Brien in our industry.

726
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,550
And she's someone that is also very much in the background.

727
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,269
She doesn't like being in the limelight.

728
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:43,530
She doesn't like going to conferences and things like that.

729
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:45,190
Quite often she's too busy.

730
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,070
And.

731
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,750
She's also from Glasgow.

732
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:57,610
And so half the time you can't understand anything she's saying, but it's just, she's such a pleasure to work for.

733
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:04,050
And if, and she pushes you, like, I don't think anyone has ever pushed me in a leadership role.

734
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:10,190
I still remember her interview where I was, I was on cause I was a sailor and based at Monaco.

735
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:15,889
And I remember like sitting on the, on the, on the bow of the boat and saying for like the fourth

736
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:16,050
time.

737
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:21,690
In a row, like, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't, could you ask that question again?

738
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:31,929
Because I don't understand what you asked and, um, but yeah, thankfully after a bunch of years now, I I'm pretty good at picking that

739
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,730
Glaswegian that sends them understanding what they're saying.

740
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,389
Um, but it still does involve, um, some moments of lip reading.

741
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,190
What a champion.

742
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:45,829
I love, I love asking that question because there are these great heroes that change people's lives out there and clearly that, you know, someone that's

743
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:47,510
a forefront of, of mine for you.

744
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,369
We are in the leader.

745
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:57,710
Well, we, we love what collaboration does and seeing, you know, people come together like you and meet Baines and Hugh van Kylenburg and Vanessa forward.

746
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,809
Incredible person, a great friend of yours.

747
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:00,170
And Dr.

748
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:08,889
Troy Flanagan is, is one example of collaboration, but you've got so much variety of interests from, from, um, music to, to the legal world.

749
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:12,730
Is there been somebody thought, wow, that's the person I'd love to collaborate with.

750
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,849
Is there a name that jumps to mind?

751
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:15,170
Oh,

752
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,090
who would I like to collaborate with?

753
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:25,369
Uh, I, um, I'm quite lucky enough to spend some time with, um, some guys that are in the, in the film industry.

754
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:35,570
And, um, I think with the music world, um, uh, you can't see it behind me, but I've, I've been collecting vinyl records since I was a tiny kid.

755
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:39,530
And, um, I've been fascinated by soundtracks.

756
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,469
Um, I love making music that, uh, that is cinematic and, and story.

757
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:44,809
Yeah.

758
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:45,110
Yeah.

759
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:51,949
And I've been obsessed for quite a long time about film.

760
00:52:51,949 --> 00:53:02,750
So I think if you ask me who I would love to collaborate with, it'd probably someone like Quentin Tarantino or, you know, the guys that are kind of just making like super cool films.

761
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,329
And I would love to do a soundtrack for, for a film.

762
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:13,889
You know, if I was to live my life over, like, uh, you know, I'd love to kind of delve into that topic, um, and, and have the opportunity to, to, to do that.

763
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:13,929
Yeah.

764
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:13,969
Yeah.

765
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:14,030
Yeah.

766
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,050
Yeah.

767
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:14,110
Yeah.

768
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:14,130
Yeah.

769
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:14,170
Yeah.

770
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:14,190
Yeah.

771
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:14,409
Yeah.

772
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:14,429
Yeah.

773
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:14,469
Yeah.

774
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:14,489
Yeah.

775
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:14,550
Yeah.

776
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:14,570
Yeah.

777
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:14,590
Yeah.

778
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:14,610
Yeah.

779
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:14,630
Yeah.

780
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,650
Yeah.

781
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:14,670
Yeah.

782
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:14,710
Yeah.

783
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,750
Yeah.

784
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:14,769
Yeah.

785
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:14,809
Yeah.

786
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:15,349
Yeah.

787
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,670
It's a, it's another extraordinary answer.

788
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:44,469
And I'm not surprised by, uh, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

789
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:47,889
by the depth of things that interest you, mate.

790
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,050
As I said, this could take another 10 hours

791
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,389
and you wouldn't even scratch the surface

792
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,449
of what is going on in your mind and your world.

793
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,230
It's been a great pleasure to get to know you.

794
00:53:57,489 --> 00:54:00,590
We both share a great mutual mate

795
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,590
and I've enjoyed the times we've got to catch up

796
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,369
and fascinated by the next chapter.

797
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,110
Stella, you'd like to buy shares in Tyson Ballard

798
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,809
and anything he says, just get on board

799
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:10,949
would be my final bit of advice.

800
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,130
But thanks for getting up early in the morning, mate,

801
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:13,590
to do this.

802
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,789
I know you're much happier behind the curtain,

803
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:18,570
but we appreciate you sharing your story today.

804
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,030
Thanks, mate.

805
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:19,489
It's been great.

806
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:21,750
Yeah, I really, really appreciate the time, Luke,

807
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,570
and hopefully we can catch up soon.

808
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,630
I'll be on the next plane to Portugal, mate.

809
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,510
Get me to one of those parties AMFE style anytime soon.

810
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:30,969
Thanks, mate.

811
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,389
It's been awesome.

812
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,030
Excellent.

813
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:32,510
Take care.
