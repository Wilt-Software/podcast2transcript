1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:08,230
No doubt in my mind, you're going to be inspired by Umrah Omar, the founder of Safari Doctors

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,089
and one of the great humanitarians on the planet.

3
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,109
Learned so much from this conversation in so many places that I think you're going to

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,829
be really inspired by.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,350
She talks about trusting in the DNA of what makes you and how her intolerance for injustice

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,070
has driven her success.

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,789
She feels as though she's built her life in reverse, helping others and making a difference

8
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,690
rather than waiting to retirement.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,070
She was raised by her grandmother and she dreamed from the youngest possible age of

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,570
being a bridge between worlds, which she's done to great success.

11
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,549
She speaks of her father as the biggest feminist she knows and how the male influence in her

12
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,509
life has broken all stereotypes.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,829
And she truly believes that humans are powerful and capable of so much.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,670
Umrah Omar is an inspiration.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this conversation.

16
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,869
We are incredibly privileged and lucky to collaborate with Umrah on our Alita Connect

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:58,409
program.

18
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,409
Umrah has a really fascinating diversity.

19
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,369
And that's what we do in this space.

20
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,150
We curate leaders from different backgrounds.

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,030
You don't have to be the founder of Safari Doctors to be part of it.

22
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,709
Head to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call.

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,290
We'd love to chat to you about it today.

24
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,709
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas, his team from Temper Bedding.

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:20,370
We know leaders are really passionate about what sleep means in their routine.

26
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,829
A Temper mattress is NASA approved.

27
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,250
It's the world's best in bedding.

28
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:25,569
Check out Temper today.

29
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,840
Umrah's contribution to community and transforming the lives of others.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,359
Is a remarkable story.

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,819
Born on the remote Pate Island, just off the northern coast of Kenya, she grew up in Nairobi

32
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,659
and pursued higher education in the United States.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,739
Umrah earned a bachelor's degree in neuroscience and psychology, and then a master's degree

34
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:54,060
in social justice and intercultural relations from the world leading institute in Vermont.

35
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,900
Her early career took her to Washington, D.C., but a strong sense of duty drew her back to

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,200
Kenya.

37
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,819
In 2015, during a visit to her hometown, Umrah recognized the diversity and the diversity

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,340
and the entire need for health care in her community and founded Safari Doctors.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,580
Safari Doctors operates mobile clinics across Kenya, reaching over 1,000 patients a month

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,099
through boats, motorcycles, and on foot.

41
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,740
Umrah's incredible work has seen her named as the UN Person of the Year in Kenya and

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,080
received the Africa Leaders for Change Award.

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,199
She was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a young global leader, a CNN top 10 hero,

44
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,560
and featured in Business Daily's Top 40 Under 40 Women.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,719
A mother of two who splits her time.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,960
Between Portugal and Kenya, Umrah, it's a great pleasure to meet you.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,300
I've heard an incredible amount about you, and congratulations on the difference that

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,659
you're making.

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,460
Thank you, Luke, and I've heard so much about you and your football geniusness, so a mutual

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,939
feeling.

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,939
That's high praise.

52
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,939
I'm very happy to keep it there and not show you any videos that might underwhelm you,

53
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,800
but I understand Safari Doctors began with you wanting to make a difference in people's

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,479
well-being.

55
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,639
Can you tell us about that story?

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,620
Your passion for making a difference?

57
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,000
I think the Safari Doctors in Lamu, Kenya found me, I guess.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
It combined all my passion.

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,659
It was home, it was healthcare, it was travel as well, and making a difference in that tiny

60
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:19,860
way.

61
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:26,240
So the idea was just to mobilize something on a monthly basis, support a nurse who travels

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,419
around five villages and gets access on the ground to the people.

63
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,860
Because one of the things that is really unfortunate for us women and for our children

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,960
is that health is a part of our daily existence versus waiting to get sick.

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,520
So if you're talking of immunizations or you're accessing family planning and so forth, it's

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,639
more of a way of life.

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,759
So how do you get it to the doorsteps is what Safari Doctors was about.

68
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,060
So it started off as a pet project of just making a tiny difference at home and then

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,020
took a life of its own.

70
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,460
And I love these words that are attributed to you, Omra.

71
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:10,340
Consistency, persistence, and dedication are what watered this seed of purpose into a tree.

72
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,020
And before you know it, you are part of a forest of change.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,199
Can you explain why that means so much to you?

74
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,079
It means so much to me because it's a reflection of when we look at a seed.

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,220
If you look at a seed, it's like this, just this tiny little something.

76
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,980
And then what people come to see is when they're eating.

77
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,959
And when you're like, you know, you have a tree or a bush and it's like, oh my God, this

78
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,500
is amazing.

79
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,139
But you're like, actually, it started as a seed.

80
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,060
And what is the seed that defines us?

81
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,100
And not being overwhelmed by thinking of, okay, we have to become this huge mango tree

82
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,259
or this huge bush, but just being focused on nurturing that small seed.

83
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,420
And then so many things come together, whether it's the weather coming together, it's the

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,660
soil.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,699
So that's how we are as humans and in the work that we do.

86
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,899
And for me, that's what really helps.

87
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:05,300
We do not get too overwhelmed about what we're doing.

88
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,360
It's like, do your part, Umrah, and then the rest will take care of itself.

89
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,259
And that's what happened with Safari Doctors.

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,279
That's what's happening.

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,160
That's what happens with raising kids.

92
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,199
You don't get a manual told, okay, this is how your adult would look like.

93
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,339
Therefore, do this today, this tomorrow.

94
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,120
So that's the philosophy around that consistency.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,399
It's because you have to pace yourself, knowing that what you're a part of is much bigger

96
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:29,980
than yourself.

97
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,040
So just do your part.

98
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,759
And you mentioned.

99
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,819
Raising kids and you're a mother of two.

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,579
And do you take that same approach too, that you're really just in every day you can do

101
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,560
small things and hopefully at the end that you've made the contribution you want to your

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,980
own family?

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,480
It's because you know, you trust in that DNA, what makes you up and you do what you can

104
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,420
because or else it's kind of like moving countries.

105
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,980
Someone's like, you know, so what's your plan?

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,819
What are you, you know, in five years, two years?

107
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:00,759
I know there's something bigger that this is a journey of.

108
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,819
And sometimes you can.

109
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,879
You find what you're, where you're headed.

110
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,160
Sometimes you just open trusting that the step that you're taking in your leadership

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,439
journey, in your parenthood journey, in your workspaces, that it being open to what's unfolding

112
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,379
and trusting that you're, you're wired to go through that.

113
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,579
When they say helping others may be the secret to living a life that's not only happier,

114
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,379
but also healthier, wealthier, more productive and meaningful.

115
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,579
Your life I look at as this great life of contribution.

116
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,019
To others.

117
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,740
Is that how it's felt to you?

118
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,939
I felt very blessed.

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,399
Look, very, very blessed in terms of almost living my life in, in reverse.

120
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,040
You know how you work, build your career, retire, and then make a difference.

121
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,120
And then you give back or you do something, a tragedy happens.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,100
And then that drives you to, you know, to make, make that impact.

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,720
So for me, after a year and a half of employment,

124
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,000
I was blessed.

125
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:08,800
And that I had that set up, whether it was a family or being back home or being able

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,600
to have a purpose, find me earlier on in life and being able to commit to that, to make

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,980
my work, work, be around that, to raise a family around that, to build a team around

128
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,300
that.

129
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,779
And then now I'm like, oh, no, that's kind of what people do when you retire or when

130
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,120
you're like, oh, I have time.

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,040
And so it's, it's in absolute reverse.

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,620
So being.

133
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:32,980
And I'm really grateful.

134
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,879
I'm really grateful that I'm able to have found that space that felt like I was making

135
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,879
a difference.

136
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,879
At the same time.

137
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,160
I could grow as an individual learn and build a career out of humanitarian work.

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,500
I think that that's a very nice place to be in.

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,800
I love how you say that that work found you.

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,779
I mentioned your, your study and your master's degree in the U S and you worked in Washington,

141
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,779
DC.

142
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,800
So you had that opportunity to take that path that a lot has changed.

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah.

144
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:07,459
a lot of people do is work for themselves and maybe build out the passions that support your

145
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,120
life. But something drew you, I think, as you said, in reverse to be able to find purpose and

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,860
then reverse engineer that. Was there a temptation for you to stay in the US and continue that path

147
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,680
or did it never feel quite right for you? I remember I did an interview once in college

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,120
and I was asked, what do you want to be when you grow up? And I was like, out of nowhere,

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,220
I was like, I want to be a bridge. And I always had that. I used to have these dreams when I was

150
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,960
a kid, which were really weird because I was raised by my grandma. But then we moved to Nairobi

151
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,480
with my parents later on. And I would dream there was this alleyway that we would play.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,879
And the moment I walked through it, I was in my grandma's backyard. And so I really looked forward

153
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,720
to going to bed. I was like, this only happens when I'm sleeping. And that then translated to

154
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,059
wanting to be a bridge. I was like, okay, there's this very,

155
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,940
driven, ambitious, Western, civilized pace and world career. And the I, I, I talk of capitalism

156
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,500
on steroids. And then at the same time, there was that co-wiring of this communal space where

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,360
anything that you do, however small, can make a big difference. So over time, being able to be

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:28,100
able to transit between these different worlds, bring the best from each to the other has been

159
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,899
my dream set up. So it worked out eventually. I didn't know how it would work out. In my head,

160
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,120
I thought it would be maybe having a job at the World Health Organization and being posted in

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,460
different places for a while. But it actually turned out in a very organic role, a way that

162
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,580
I could define myself in my terms and build an organization around it.

163
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,080
It's fascinating to say it literally was your dream.

164
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,259
As a young girl to actually see yourself in that light. And then to be able to say those words

165
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,860
in college must have been interesting for you. Grew up on a tiny island of 3000 people,

166
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,519
I think surrounded by mangroves is sort of unique to think you can come back with all of that

167
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,139
expertise and knowledge and be that bridge in life. As you said, it's, it's turned out in a

168
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,100
way that maybe you couldn't have imagined, but do you think that was always your destiny?

169
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,799
It's, I feel like we all have an idea of what we dream or desire or feel like your

170
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,080
destiny.

171
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,200
And then now it's just along the way navigating the noise and the background chaos, you know,

172
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,080
like the echo that we had setting up the podcast. And it's quite hard, you know, you go, you kind

173
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,100
of really have, okay, let's log out, let's log back in, let's figure it out until you fine tune

174
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,240
to, to, you know, what it is, that's that safe space, that purposeful space for you. So it was,

175
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,840
I just feel very, very fortunate that

176
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,080
I could,

177
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,960
you know, define this journey for myself.

178
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,980
And we feel incredibly privileged to have been able to collaborate with you and a world called

179
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,340
Alita Connect that we're really passionate about curating groups of people from different

180
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,620
backgrounds that maybe wouldn't have got together. And I love your group because I'm sure this group

181
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,779
of people would never have connected from Paul Barnes from McLaren Racing in Formula One and

182
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:27,960
Carlos Custa from Arsenal. Nico Cain is a CEO of a huge organization and an amazing story. Justin

183
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,259
Longmuir, an Australian rules football coach in Fremantle in Australia, and your incredible story.

184
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,679
Can you tell us about, you know, sitting down with that group on a regular basis and what that's meant

185
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,000
for you?

186
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:46,919
At first, I was a little skeptical of the Alita Connect group, I would lie. You know, here I am,

187
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,700
this African girl villager and here, like, you know, five other senior white male officials

188
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,919
working in all these different fields. So I was like, oh, my friend's like, no, it's an amazing,

189
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,720
amazing process. It's going to unlock, like, you know, thoughts and spaces you didn't know

190
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,159
existed. And Matt was really cool. Stephanie was just fantastic. So like seven, I think we're

191
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:16,000
seven sessions in or something. It's, it defines the word creativity for me. So when I looked up

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,080
the word creativity to understand it, it defines it as the ability to like see connections where

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,820
none seem to exist. And I think that's the magic of Alita.

194
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,600
What it did. And sure enough, here we are, we're sitting, you know, there's, there's a football

195
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,000
component, here's Arsenal, you know, we, we run healthcare, and we use football as a tool of

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,639
communicating to young men and girls around sexual and reproductive rights, you know, so like, oh,

197
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,360
that's really, that's really random. And then the most random personal connection comes with Paul,

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,899
I'm like, Paul, in Formula One, like logistics, I'm like, okay, our life,

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,000
is around logistics and healthcare. And then you're learning about this person, like moving

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,039
hundreds of people across the globe. And then I'm like, Formula One, what are the chances? My son is

201
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,539
karting, he's in motorsports, he's like, we're like McLaren fans, you know, we have the hats

202
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:21,120
cheering, and I'm always rooting for Lando. So it was like, really an interesting space to be in

203
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,899
and having these platforms of like, not just leadership discussion, but like the back end,

204
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,440
of leadership. I think it's a part that, you know, when they say it's a lonely space,

205
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,759
and having this intimate group that's very intentional, open to being vulnerable,

206
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:44,799
and you can like bounce on your challenges with as well, was a very critical tool. So Alida was

207
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:52,799
definitely not my usual, you know, workshop panels, like humanitarian spaces, but more of an

208
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,759
intentional dissection of leadership. So yeah.

209
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,460
It's a beautiful description, Norma, and I just, you know, the way that you've described those

210
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,080
connections and the different thinking of people being open-minded, we often talk about

211
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,580
people for a long time have been in our silos, and we work in our spaces, and we end up with

212
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,100
that groupthink often to great effect. But when you put that random creativity, as you described it,

213
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,440
it can be quite powerful. And it sounds as though that's something that sort of really

214
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,779
resonated with you. That was a big takeaway for me. And just that urge,

215
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,500
we had one session with, I think his name was Ben, the conductor of the orchestra.

216
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,179
Ben Northey, who's the conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra,

217
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,480
is a beautiful, creative guy. Ben, he dropped into your group, did he, Norma?

218
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,519
It was very insightful. I went to a college that was an Oberlin College around music,

219
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,139
and not in a single, you know, million years would I have thought that, okay, here's

220
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:57,279
something that can show you linkages of no different than what we were doing on a field

221
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,759
hockey pitch.

222
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,080
Like I played field hockey, and I'm like, you know, from orchestra on stage or field

223
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:10,279
hockey or going to any part of the world, it was a very powerful illustration of teamwork

224
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,299
and leadership.

225
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:17,440
Norma, I read that you come from a family of very progressive men that have nurtured

226
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,399
the strong women in your world, and that there was a lot of misconception about, in your

227
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,759
words, your community. Can you tell us a bit about those strong men and the misconception

228
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,279
of your community that they have perhaps broken the trend from?

229
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:41,080
So we are, like, my father is the biggest feminist I know, before feminism existed.

230
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:48,840
Here's a man, the most, you know, eligible bachelor in town, politician, and, you know,

231
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,379
is like advanced in his space. And he achieved all this, you know, as a self-made person

232
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,440
to then go and marry.

233
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,580
And the first thing he does...

234
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,639
The first thing he does is get married, delays having kids, which is abnormal, because usually

235
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,460
that would be a really bad reputation, you know, being called. And then the first thing

236
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,139
he did was have to send my mom to school. And not just to school, but to Rockford, Illinois

237
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,019
in the United States for, like, away from these two young kids. And so everyone called

238
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,100
my parents, like, crazy. Like, these are the craziest human beings. You know, how does

239
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,460
a man get a young, beautiful wife and then, like, send her away?

240
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,159
And here's these two young kids. How reckless. And that was, like, the biggest investment

241
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:40,279
that could ever happen. And especially with three girls. With three girls, no boys at

242
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,279
home. And then that goes back, though, to looking at my grandma. She's, like, this strong

243
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,759
95-year-old lady who's, like, a matriarch. And at 5 a.m. in her house, it's, like, this

244
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,759
man having coffee. At 5 p.m. before the evening prayers, it's his mother. And she's, like,

245
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,799
this man having coffee.

246
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:06,000
So we come from a society that is honestly very matriarchal, as much as we don't like

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,799
to admit it. But now when you look at the impact of colonialism, when you look at the

248
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,519
impact of the Islamic influence that came of, you know, putting societies into boxes,

249
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,039
checkboxes, defining whether it's what went into our constitution, what went into the

250
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,299
prayers.

251
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:34,119
The patriarchy kind of starts diluting in. But if we look at other societies, like in

252
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,259
Kenya, we have the Kikuyu community, where men take their mothers' names as last names,

253
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,240
for example. But you don't hear that being talked about, because there's all this narrative

254
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,799
of, you know, we've got to fix this. There must be a gender issue here, and so forth.

255
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:57,759
So on my end, I'm just very aware of the fact that we cannot take a broad stroke.

256
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:04,700
We do have to point out the nuances, whether it's matriarchy, whether it's the strong men

257
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:12,319
who actually carry women on their shoulders for the next generation. And I've seen that

258
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,799
a lot growing up. And maybe that's why it's coming with the, you know, you can't tell

259
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,420
me no, you can't tell me that you can't, you know, do this. And I try to do the same

260
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,579
with the kids. I remember being told I couldn't swim. I'm like, you know what, I'm going to

261
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,660
swim, and I'm going to be the best swimmer that there is.

262
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:33,799
In school. And that happened. And so having more and more of these narratives come to

263
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,779
the forefront, look, I think is very critical.

264
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,180
Well, Maria, in Australia at the moment, there is a horrific epidemic of violence against

265
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,700
women. It's a national disgrace, I think, is a term a lot of us use. And these violent

266
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,779
acts that are happening on a regular basis, as you said, it's such a complex and nuanced

267
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:57,400
conversation that you, you know, growing up in a loving family and having what you described

268
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,759
as,

269
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:03,039
as a father and a mother, and you find it almost hard to comprehend. And do you think,

270
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,339
you know, we don't tell the stories like the progressiveness of your dad enough and

271
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,960
that we perhaps focus on the alternative sometimes? Is there part of the solution in that for

272
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,700
what is a really complex and horrible problem?

273
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,720
It is part of the solution. I mean, if you don't see more of such a reality, then you're

274
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,740
wired to think that it's not possible, or it doesn't exist, whether it's in sports,

275
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,220
you're talking domestic violence. We just had a meeting, a very interesting meeting

276
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,900
this morning with the political leaders around reproductive health as part of Safari Doctors

277
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,619
Program. And one of the guys said something very important. Whenever he's like, whenever

278
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:47,940
we talk family planning, we just think women. And maybe that's the problem is that men need

279
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,519
to be actively engaged to know that they're part of the situation as well. So if you're

280
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,759
coming home, and you just want your wife popping babies, everyone, you know, you're not going

281
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,839
here, but you don't understand the physiology of a woman, what she's going through, what

282
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:09,339
needs to happen, then that will always be a problem. You're addressing just like a one

283
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,920
end of it, and there's a hole at the end of the bucket, and you're just filling water

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,740
saying, you know, we're doing this. So if you look at issues of especially domestic

285
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,920
violence, a lot of the cases, and I don't have the stats to kind of spew out, is that

286
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,480
you'd see either it's like historic.

287
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:34,839
It's somebody who's witnessed it before in their family. It's kind of, there's this linear

288
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:40,599
progression around it of what someone experiences as familiar and then how they deal with it,

289
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,160
whether it's what they saw their mother go through or, or somebody within their close

290
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:53,380
space go through. So that's one of the tools is being like, this does not have to be the

291
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,319
how love is expressed. Like we've done surveys and communities where

292
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,339
women are like, you know, if I burn the food, I should be beaten. You know, what am I doing

293
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,119
burning food? But, but, but that, that's a basic understanding where it's like, no, it

294
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,660
doesn't, it doesn't have to be that way. And it has to happen to both parties because the

295
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,140
same guys who are perpetuating the violence, again, are coming from a history of violence,

296
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,799
a lot of them. So, so I think having these stories, what you're doing, what you guys

297
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,140
do, it's like getting information stories out there, realities out there. That is one

298
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,759
of the elements that we need to tackle.

299
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,960
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to be able to share stories like yours. And it feels like

300
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,160
the world hasn't had too much space for that, isn't it? The nightly news tells stories of

301
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,180
grim and horror and the algorithms tend to work towards the negative bias, don't they?

302
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,039
And it's a fight back, isn't it, to hear.

303
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,960
The media is so responsible for this because it's like, you know, anything, every time

304
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm always scrolling down, it's like worry stories or, you know, this happened, somebody

305
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,759
got killed or so on. So it's, it's, it's just, and that's an unfortunate thing.

306
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,460
It's an unfortunate space as well, that kind of digital for improvement.

307
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:05,539
Yeah. You know, the story of how progressive your grandfather must have been and your dad

308
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,839
at that time is incredibly inspiring. And you also founded a school to serve the focal

309
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,059
families where you grew up. But I, I think when I read that, a lot of us have great intentions,

310
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,559
but not many people get serious things done like you do. What sets you apart in that way?

311
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,319
How do you find a way, as you said, to get that seed to grow into the beautiful tree

312
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,759
that provides fruit, as you described?

313
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,059
What sets you apart?

314
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,380
I don't know. Look, as somebody, I'm like, you know, you don't have a problem and the

315
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,900
first thing she wants to do is fix it. Maybe it's that male quality that they call. But

316
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,039
I don't know. I just feel like humans are, we're very powerful. I think when I think

317
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,940
of all the great, you know, us being able to have this conversation, you think of people

318
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,039
who've done so much more, you know, think of the Graham Bells and Einstein and you're

319
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,660
like, oh my God.

320
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,420
I think of Mansa Musa and, you know, the pyramids. I don't know. I go into those weird spaces

321
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,339
where like, and therefore what we're trying to do is like nothing. It's absolutely nothing.

322
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,980
I'm like, you know, there's somebody who was sailing the seas back in the day without Google

323
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:19,559
Maps. I'm like, wow, that's impressive. So we were home and Safari Doctors, after a year,

324
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,480
I think I realized that it's no longer like a pet project that I could do from Nairobi

325
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,119
or New York.

326
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,680
And I had a 10-year-old boy. No, not 10 years. He's 10 years now. He was 10 months then.

327
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,920
And he hated going to school. He loved it the first two days. It was exciting. And then

328
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,839
after that, I would like have to sneak around and like walk him halfway and then like disappear

329
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,660
from an alley or, you know, get a donkey home and be like, hey, guess what? Today you're

330
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,279
going to school with a donkey. And it was just, I say every morning, I'm so happy to

331
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,400
be here as an adult. But my son is like so miserable.

332
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,440
And the idea of going to school. So then that's when three of us parents got together

333
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,880
who wanted our kids to have more of an experiential learning education versus sitting in a classroom

334
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,779
and looking at a blackboard. How could they be in a space where they could interact with

335
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:20,759
nature? They could learn colors by walking around and, you know, as opposed to from a

336
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:27,700
textbook. And then, so there was a space and we shoved three of them and then neighbor's

337
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:27,759
kids.

338
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:36,059
And I thought it would be just like a homeschooling experience where three of us got in, got a

339
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:43,039
teacher or two and taught in some subjects. And now we have 50 kids. My son and my daughter

340
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,880
were able to transition from that school to like one of the most competitive like international

341
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
schools. It's like, oh, so we must be doing something right. It can't be that bad because

342
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,380
everyone was like, they don't learn there. They're just playing and having too much fun.

343
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,759
So that's how we got in.

344
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:03,960
We have a school called Shambhala Shaila, which is in my front yard back at home in

345
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,880
Lamo. And we now have seven teachers and five staff members. So it's kids coming in from

346
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:19,259
8.30 with a full meal until end of the day. They get to do all these random village experiences,

347
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:24,259
but also global experiences. So being able to take like seven, eight kids, take them

348
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,400
to get passports and travel out of the country.

349
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:33,700
You know, creating random opportunities, have a swimming program because I really believe

350
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,359
in swimming and how much it did for me. So that's the little vision that translated into

351
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,460
this exciting. So I look forward to retiring and having like 50 kids running in the compound.

352
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,759
I love someone who's got a master's degree from one of the leading education institutes

353
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,960
in the world, sees the beauty in the creativity of letting kids play and learn in a different

354
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
way. It's another great story.

355
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah.

356
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,559
And I've had great privilege of sitting across from incredible people like you. And we think

357
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,700
that success leaves clues and that there are some patterns in leadership. I want to ask

358
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,519
you a handful of questions on that basis. Starting with self-leadership, we feel hard

359
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,279
to do what you do or what anyone achieves like you have without a sense of self-leadership.

360
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,200
What does that term mean to you?

361
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,839
I'm going to ask you as an athlete. I spin it on your table. Have you go from like athletics

362
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,920
and having the discipline to have a podcast?

363
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Yeah.

364
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,200
And just sit around doing research. That's a lot of self-leadership. What drives you

365
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,039
to do that? Let me spin this one.

366
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,480
It's a lot easier asking the questions than answering as it turns out, Umrah. But I think

367
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,079
probably the discipline of sport gave me that belief to get out of bed. And morning routine,

368
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,700
I feel for me, has been something that's helped me in good stead by getting up and being active

369
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,500
and exercising and then starting the day in a positive way and building on those little

370
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
moments.

371
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,680
That discipline for me has turned out beneficial in other areas of being able to follow through

372
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,460
and do things because sport gave you that ability to be able to do that and take on

373
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,920
board feedback and want to be a constant learner and want to constantly improve. And I feel

374
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,559
athletes probably misunderstand that. They get to the end of their life and their sporting

375
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,759
life and they go, I know nothing. And often you do, but I think you take some of that

376
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:26,079
in your life. That for me is that self-leadership of starting the day with good habits and good

377
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,920
routines. It sets you free. It sets you free. It sets you free. It sets you free. It sets

378
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,380
me up for the rest of the day. How about you?

379
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,579
That's very true. With athleticism, having swum at Orillia and then picked up field hockey

380
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:42,940
and then seeing it in my son as well, I can see the difference. So that's definitely a

381
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:51,819
component. On my end, more severely though, I have a serious allergy to injustice, super

382
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:56,920
allergic to that. I'm talking, I will not be quiet. And I think for me, that's what I'm

383
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,299
talking about. And that's what pushes me to kind of, maybe it's almost like proving

384
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:06,700
a point that you say, whether it's like, oh, as women, you can't or shouldn't be able to

385
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,839
do this. I'm like, that invokes some serious self-leadership to prove otherwise. You're

386
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,559
talking about, oh, you know, talk about race. You talk about nationalism. You bring it.

387
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,640
But for me, it's like really puts up that fire. And especially in like seeing it for

388
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,900
the next generation, because I feel like we're on the same page. I feel like we're on the

389
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,759
same page almost in that phase of, it's no longer about aspiring, but about transmitting

390
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:39,500
before then checking out and being like, okay, you've done what you've done. So also the

391
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:48,200
young, the next generation is really inspiring. It drives me to have that push of, okay, we

392
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,500
need to pass that baton on. You need to be on top of your stuff. You need to be that

393
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,359
role model. You need to expand the boundaries.

394
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,079
Something like in 2022, we ran for office and everyone's like, you know, you're not

395
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:09,259
a politician. You've never, there's a lot of old guards, but it's like that, that, that

396
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:16,500
discipline of mobilizing resources, getting a team, being like almost a small band because

397
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,099
we're like a non-starter, the underdogs. For me, yeah, I'm driven by self-leadership for

398
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,440
me is because of the underdog, basically.

399
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,299
Yeah, I love that.

400
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,579
Incredible answer. We see people are really conscious now of how they positively impact

401
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,759
others in their environment. That sounds like the most ridiculous question to ask someone

402
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,839
who impacts people the way you do. But do you think about that on a daily basis that

403
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,660
the people you interact with and how you go about impacting people, is that something

404
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,359
you're conscious of every day?

405
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,460
No, I don't think it's like a mantra or I started meditation, but okay, these are the

406
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,180
five things I'm going to work on today.

407
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I think it's just a way of like, you know, the same way you don't get up and think, oh,

408
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,259
I'm a man. What do I do when I go take a piss today? Like you just, it just happens. So

409
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:13,460
it's the same. It's just, it's just a, it's a space. It's a way. Sometimes you need to

410
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,200
put yourself in check, especially when you're getting like a battery low, when you're like,

411
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
you feel like your brain, I think it's, it's one of the hardest spaces in athletics is

412
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,900
when you're losing, you know, there's that.

413
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,180
That point where you're like, okay, then you need to be more conscious about it. You're

414
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,480
like, okay, you know what, this is the purpose that you got this, or here's where you turn

415
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:43,339
to for refueling and recharging and everything. But otherwise you just walk on it. And it's

416
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:48,000
the triggers that come around, you know, sometimes, what was it? I saw somebody like cutting the

417
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
line. I'm like, I think he's cutting that line. And we're just going to watch them cut

418
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,660
the line like that. And you go tap on the shoulder and they're like, you're really going

419
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,319
to call me out.

420
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,039
It's, it's just in you.

421
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,460
And that shows up in those little moments too. Like if there's any injustice, you can't

422
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,579
be silent. You'll, you'll, you'll pause. How many of the line is pushing in the line?

423
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,440
They're going, they're going back.

424
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,019
I wouldn't cross Umrah Omar, I think.

425
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:16,279
It would be in a nice way, because then we'll still joke about it and maybe even like have

426
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,859
a cup of tea later on. But it, and that's the, that's just the other thing though, is

427
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:26,859
also how do you navigate these experiences and spaces without, um,

428
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,680
fighting? It, it doesn't have to be a fight. Like it doesn't have to be, um, a confrontation.

429
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:39,819
And I think that's a space and that could question or could improve your, um, your position

430
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:45,400
as a leader. Um, I had that, I have to put myself in check a lot. Like, okay, Umrah,

431
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,119
this is what you want to fix, but this is your end goal, but how you get there will

432
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:56,740
determine, um, a lot of, uh, you know, the process will determine a lot. And, uh, that's,

433
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:56,900
um, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,

434
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,380
that's the hard space to navigate. Cause sometimes you want to yell, you want to like

435
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,720
slap or think you like, you have to put a smile on. I feel like, Hey,

436
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,920
creating safari doctors in your own school is a, is a, is a unique vision. How have you

437
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,420
gone about sort of sharing those visions and bringing them to life?

438
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,740
Um, we, that's a good question. Um, one of the most basic things is with the kids, like

439
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,380
when we have conversations and they're like, yeah, my mom does safari doctors. I want to,

440
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,200
you know, keep doing what you're doing when I, when you're older, when you, so just first is

441
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,400
just within the home. Um, and especially with my dad, I think he's the most proud and he's always

442
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,079
like checking in. Um, and then the beauty about it is that it just leads you to the next step to

443
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,960
do something else. So like, we just, we just built the first, um, semi Olympic pool in, in

444
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,339
Lama County. And that for me, like bigger than anything, because as an athlete, somebody who

445
00:32:54,339 --> 00:33:00,000
wanted to be an Olympian, um, but couldn't because of the societal restrictions, I'm like,

446
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,640
whatever you do, it's like, it's safari doctors now is running itself. We have the team,

447
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,400
they have the, you know, they're doing the impact and I'm just there as like a sounding board

448
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,240
and then moving on to not set up the school more substantially. And then what that gives you the

449
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,359
leverage to do next. So that's the beauty I feel in the work that I do is like it's growth. Um,

450
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,319
and it's not gross, like a career,

451
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:30,299
growth of just watching yourself grow as an individual. It's growth of seeing, you know,

452
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,619
Mariam who started as a office assistant, who's not like a program manager. It's seeing Amina

453
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:42,180
who came in as an intern who now can stand in for my panel sitting in Dubai and like at the

454
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:47,980
biggest humanitarian conference. So, so that's, that's, I think is the most satisfying, um, uh,

455
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,079
part of, uh, of seeing this impact that you're, you're talking about.

456
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,980
And over, we see,

457
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:59,680
uh, curiosity is a word that, uh, comes up a lot. And through curiosity, um, leaders like you

458
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,380
approach their learning and development through being constantly curious. Does that resonate with

459
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:11,500
you? It's, um, it's, it's even stronger than curiosity, but what I love about the curiosity,

460
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,719
I always remember we're always told curiosity, kill the cat, curiosity, kill the cat. And then

461
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,920
one day, I don't know who it was. It was like, yeah. And satisfaction brought it back. Oh,

462
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:29,739
that's it. That's it. We're not stopping. We're going to poke our nose in everything. Um, but

463
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:36,019
yeah, there is a, there's a curiosity and then there's like an intensity and love of life and

464
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:42,320
possibilities as well. That kind of projects into that where, you know, there's no more you're

465
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,679
hungry. Yeah. You're curious. It's curiosity, that hunger of, um, um, whether it's making a

466
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,639
bigger impact or making a bigger, um,

467
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,679
you know, unlock, how do you put it? I don't even like the thing breaking glass ceilings because

468
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,380
there's no ceilings really, but just kind of like really flying for them further out. But at the

469
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,440
same time being connected, having your roots deep, I always think of the analogy of a tree and how

470
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,039
the roots are just as deep as the branches, but you never really see that, but you cannot go that

471
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,400
far out without going deeper down. So that's how the curiosity model should work.

472
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,960
Yeah. Beautifully said. Uh, communicating with clarity is something we see leaders are really

473
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,559
conscious of. How have you gone about your, uh, your communication?

474
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,539
Hmm. I think I did a good job of giving us a survey at the beginning, um, that we had to get

475
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:42,400
out to our colleagues to find out if we are as phenomenal as we're supposed to be, or as people

476
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,699
like Luke, um, dupe us into thinking we are, um, we, uh, so we'll keep back. That's, that's the

477
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:52,559
weakness actually. That's my weakness. And, uh, they're like,

478
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,380
the feedback was that, you know, we, we have these big visions. We have a leader of big vision,

479
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,860
but how do we get there? Or maybe they're too warped up in your head that you're not translating

480
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:10,079
it, um, to the team that, that has to do it. So that's my problem. I also see it, um, at home

481
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,760
sometimes. And then I'd be like, Oh, why is it done? But you didn't tell us you have to be done

482
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,039
at a certain time. I was like, Oh, you know, when you say done, it has to be done immediately.

483
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:22,840
So it's just that.

484
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:31,380
It makes you like think back and like, okay, maybe your brain is going, um, on 200 kilometers an hour,

485
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:38,000
but then you need to translate that to who you need to get to that speed as well. Yeah. So

486
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,280
communication, being clear, being, um, um, thoughtful as well in, uh, in how that should

487
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,739
be delivered, like what the expectation is from, from that, um, uh,

488
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:57,159
you, you're clear. And then upon being clear, it's also, is the capacity there,

489
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,900
um, that to be able to deliver on what you're trying to communicate.

490
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:06,480
And I appreciate you sharing that, isn't it? At the start of, um, the process asked you to,

491
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,679
to send out to all the people that you work with that, you know, a couple or, you know,

492
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:15,000
many as you like, and take on some feedback about your impact in your space. And the fact

493
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,880
that that was something that you wanted to get better at and, and, and some feedback your way

494
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,699
on communicating a little bit more clearly.

495
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,280
It takes a bit of courage, we think, uh, to do that, but is that been something that's

496
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,039
been beneficial then to say how I actually can put some work into that for you?

497
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,679
Yeah, that was been, that was very beneficial. It was also really helpful hearing the rest of

498
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:40,599
the team on what all they needed to work on the feedback, um, that they got from, from the team.

499
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:45,059
Cause you're usually, you're usually the one evaluating or getting feedback and you never

500
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:50,320
do what you call that 360 evaluation, which is something that, um, we're looking at introducing

501
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,639
in a healthy way in the organization.

502
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:57,139
Um, which brought up the question. I remember one of the breakout, we always had a breakout

503
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:03,159
session where every, um, a member kind of brought in what their hurdle was. And I remember

504
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:08,800
after that, my hurdle was, you know, who leads the leader. And I was like, it's something

505
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,480
that you take for granted. And it's a really dangerous space, um, uh, to be in as well,

506
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,719
because I get this feedback where it's like, okay, please communicate like clearly and

507
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,719
how you communicate and be, uh,

508
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:28,039
and let us know what needs to be done. Cause we're here to get stuff done. But my reaction,

509
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,920
my being emotional, um, about it is problematic. So that activity was really, really useful

510
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,360
in just being like, okay, stop. You're doing this in one way. How's that being received?

511
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,039
Um, it has to be a two way street. Like leadership can't be a one way street.

512
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,260
How important has collaboration been for you?

513
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,619
Collaboration has been healthy, healthy. It's like, actually I'm talking like physically,

514
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:58,420
literally healthy, um, collaborate, um, allow everyone to be able to delegate and it's more

515
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:07,739
effective. Um, uh, it's more, um, uh, practical and it's, it's just, it's healthy. I'm talking

516
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:13,900
like, especially like recently with Safari doctors being able to bring on board, let's

517
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,880
say like a deputy director and evaluation person and like have all these positions.

518
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,460
Cause before it felt like we, before, uh,

519
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:28,900
and, uh, learning about these leadership spaces, it felt like you're playing a football game with

520
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:36,699
eight players and the eight players were not playing a passing game. So you can imagine

521
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:41,440
somebody gets the ball, try to sprint, go score. Nothing goes in. Some next person is like, Oh,

522
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,320
I got this. I'm going to do it because I'm, you know, I want to deliver and I want to show,

523
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,639
but then you're like, no, you have to collaborate or else we just all end up losing. Um, so no,

524
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:54,679
it's been really, we've gone into an 11th year.

525
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,320
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

526
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,960
No, and it's not, I know it's stereotypical. They all love their mom, but, um, my mom was

527
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,300
literally a leader, like professionally. Um, she was studying it when people are not studying it

528
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,420
in the eighties. Um, she'd left two kids at home and then she comes back to be this career woman,

529
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,539
but at the same time knows how to,

530
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:28,360
to balance with her social responsibilities as well. Being a wife, being like a daughter,

531
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,739
being a mother. And I think that's part of like a trade of leadership is how do you navigate

532
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:40,059
your different roles and your different spaces. And then the scariest thing I ever did was, uh,

533
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:46,420
look at her spreadsheet on how she leads and manages. I'm talking like she keeps like two

534
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,719
desktops and they're like all color coded and like, you know, who she's delegating to,

535
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:57,800
when she's following up, I'm like, Whoa, I can barely like, you know, put things on my WhatsApp

536
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,460
phone alerts. It's yeah. It was literally seeing how you can lead from the home to the community,

537
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,000
to the career, um, spaces. That was really impressive. And then she managed, she came

538
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,719
on to manage our political campaign and she maps everything out. She puts like,

539
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:20,380
it was literally like being in a, in a, in a war room and seeing that happen and getting to see

540
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,719
that firsthand and up close.

541
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:27,420
There wasn't a hesitation for you. It was instantaneous, wasn't it? To have that in

542
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,420
your life. And it's, uh, it's beautiful, isn't it? To have that influence that,

543
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,000
and without knowing you at all, it sounds a lot like the life that you've lived.

544
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,119
Can you say that in yourself?

545
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,679
Oh, I wish I, maybe I have like, um, a quarter of that discipline and the skill and

546
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:51,719
soberheadedness. Like if I was really generous, I'd say 33%, but she, and when you ask her,

547
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:56,059
ask leader, cause the first is like, Oh, that, that, you know, am I favoring? But I was like,

548
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,139
wait a minute. This is like a factual, like when you're talking about leadership, when I look at

549
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:06,420
the presentations that Stephanie gave us, you know, who's the person that comes close to,

550
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,920
um, to scoring an eight plus on that it's yeah. It's definitely. And we get to use that until

551
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,920
today. Like I get to use her as a sounding board. Like I said, when we were doing the campaign,

552
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,659
um, a year and a half ago, she was the one who had like map,

553
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:27,699
out everything she had like budgeted it, done all that stuff. So it's a resource that I still

554
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:34,579
get to tap into. We're obsessed with the collaboration and, um, what it means to get

555
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:40,159
people together out of their silos and so much that you've achieved. And I suspect so much more

556
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,139
to come. Is there anyone that you thought I'd love to collaborate with, whether it's safari

557
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:48,920
doctors or one of your other passions, it could be a hobby that you love. Is there a name you

558
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,719
thought, Oh, that's the person that I would love to collaborate with?

559
00:42:51,739 --> 00:43:00,559
Um, yeah, I'm thinking of, uh, not an individual, but a field. Definitely. I think a politician,

560
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:07,719
an elected politician would be an interesting space. Someone who navigates the electorate and

561
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:14,179
like delivering, um, a mandate and it involves finances. It involves policies. It involves all

562
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:21,440
of that. So, and when I think of, um, I think of someone maybe like, uh, Jacinda Arden and

563
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,719
especially what, you know, her having to having a burnout and having to step out and knowing when

564
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:32,900
to draw the line, balancing the gender, um, aspect as well. So I'd really be curious to hear from

565
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,639
like female politician. Um, maybe I'm also biased in, in that space. And then the athletics is

566
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:46,659
always, um, uh, a big space to, to learn about collaboration. It's all about team and, um, it,

567
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:51,260
it just so, so like literal, um, uh, when, when you think of it.

568
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,820
So I would, it would be interesting to, yeah, to unlock those two spaces.

569
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,940
Well, Maritza, uh, fills you hard up to know that people are out there like you achieving what you're

570
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,460
achieving in such a humble, but brilliant way. And to, to share part of your story, as I said,

571
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,760
it's been inspiring to hear it from afar and I've been looking forward to, uh, to this conversation

572
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,719
and congratulations again on the amazing work that you continue to do. And I really appreciate

573
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,940
you taking the time to, uh, to catch up today. Thank you.

574
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,420
Thank you, Luke.

575
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,559
And have a good one.
