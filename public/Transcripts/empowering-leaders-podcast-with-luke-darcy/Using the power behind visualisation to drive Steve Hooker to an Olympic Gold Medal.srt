00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:08,900
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is the legendary Australian Olympic

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,900
gold medal winner, Steve Hooker. Fascinating discussion. I learned an enormous amount from

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,079
sitting down and spending some time with Steve. You'll hear him talk about his tendency for living

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:24,219
in the future, that while sometimes a curse is actually a superpower. And he describes in great

5
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:30,579
detail his incredible ability to visualize what he wants to achieve and then work his way back

6
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,740
from there to put a plan in place. So long as it's aligned with passion, he's able to solve

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,600
those problems that are required, which enabled him to achieve extraordinary things, certainly

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,780
in the sporting arena, which he did at the Olympic Games, but also in his life post-sport.

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,299
Steve also touches on the fact that it wasn't until he was 15 that he first tried pole vault

10
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:57,179
and he still remains the fourth highest pole vaulter of all time. He often talks about not

11
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,460
being an expert in anything other than jumping six meters with a pole in his

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:00,560
hand. He talks about not being an expert in anything other than jumping six meters with a

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,579
pole in his hand. He talks about not being an expert in anything other than jumping six meters with

14
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,780
a pole in his hand. But that couldn't be further from the truth from my experience with

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,239
the legendary Steve Hooker. He speaks about his skills and passion for problem solving

16
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,939
that he honed as an athlete. And that's what drives him every day in the work that he's doing

17
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,900
to this day. He also talks about understanding risk and consequences as an athlete. That's

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,719
transferred over into his role as a senior leader in business who is having extraordinary success

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,900
in this next part of his life. He also talks about surrounding himself with really clever people

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,260
and that guiding the group around him reminds him that he doesn't,

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,540
know exactly everything, doesn't need to know everything, but he's got an incredible way of

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,579
connecting people and joining the dots. Fascinating discussion with a great Australian Olympian,

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,959
but a really incredible thinker. I'm sure you're going to learn a lot from Steve Hooker.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,159
It's people like Steve Hooker that are the inspiration for the work that we do at Alita.

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,579
We'd love you to check out our bespoke, facilitated Alita Connect program where we

26
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,359
bring together groups of five to six people, people like Steve from different backgrounds

27
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,760
with different thinkers.

28
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,819
And we love connecting people around the globe and supporting people's thinking

29
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:09,199
in this forum. Someone like Steve has got an incredible understanding of what it takes to

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,780
be successful, to connect and collaborate people at different levels is something we're really

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,379
passionate about. I often say, you don't have to be an Olympic gold medal winner like Steve Hooker

32
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:23,819
to be part of our program, Alita Connect. We love connecting with our friends from the arts and from

33
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,219
social venture and from the entrepreneurial space and from sport, bringing them together.

34
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,479
So I'd love you to check it out.

35
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,819
If you're interested, have a look at alitacollective.com. You can book a discovery call.

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,159
My great partner and friend, Matt Waterwitz, or I'll give you a call and love to follow up about

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,060
Alita Connect and our great passion for bringing different thinkers together.

38
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,199
Huge thanks as always to the team at Temper Bedding Australia, New Zealand.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,740
Jason Nicholas and his team have been great supporters of the Empowering Leaders podcast,

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,539
are really passionate about bringing stories to the table like Steve Hooker today,

41
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,080
which I'm sure you're going to enjoy. And we know extraordinary athletes like Steve and great

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
leaders understand the value.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,439
And investing in a mattress that is world-class, NASA approved, the best bedding in the world,

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,740
is an investment you will not regret. We spend a third of our life asleep.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,240
Temper is a mattress like no other. I urge you to check it out.

46
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,199
On the 22nd of August, 2008, Steve Hooker became the first Australian male Olympic gold medalist

47
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,680
in a track and field event since Ralph Dubelle, 40 years earlier, the 1968 Mexico Olympics.

48
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,539
Steve Hooker is one of only a handful of athletes to hold Olympic World Championship,

49
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,539
IAAF World Championships.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,919
He won the World Indoor Championship, IAAF Continental Cup, Commonwealth Games titles

51
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,500
at the same time after completing the set in 2010.

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,659
He's the first Australian man to hold both Olympic and World Championship titles concurrently.

53
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,439
Steve's personal best height of 6.06 metres has him placed in the top echelon in pole vaulting

54
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,060
history. Steve was the captain of the Australian athletics team from 2008 to 2012.

55
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,219
And his incredible discipline, commitment and work ethic has seen his outstanding success in sport

56
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,939
replicated in his business career.

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,219
Steve, it's always a great pleasure to spend some time with you. Thanks for taking the time

58
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:08,840
to catch up today.

59
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,539
No worries at all, Daz. Great to see you.

60
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,439
Can I take you back? I want to go back to that moment in 2008. Your great Russian rival

61
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,139
fails in his third attempt at 5.90 metres. You've clipped the bar twice from what I understand

62
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,180
at that height from memory and you had one more attempt. It's going to change your life

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,540
if you get over the bar. How do you get it right in that moment knowing that it's such

64
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,839
a significant time?

65
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,839
It's a long answer to that question because I hadn't had a good career.

66
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,699
Competition up to that point. I cleared my opening height on my first attempt and then

67
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,899
I cleared 5.80 metres and 5.85 metres both on third attempt clearances. So just staying alive

68
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,300
and not with great jumps, to be honest. But I started sort of finding my feet a little bit at

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,920
5.90 metres. My first attempt was okay. My second attempt was really good. And it meant I knew I was

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,980
on the right bit of equipment, the right pole with the right jump to clear 5.90. When you're

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,819
getting missed, it was obviously that's the door opening. That's my opportunity.

72
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:12,079
My destiny is in my own hands. And after that, I mean, I was excited and I knew it was my moment.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,980
And that was the moment I'd be preparing for. And after what had been a really hard competition,

74
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:24,180
that jump, that was the easiest jump I had in the competition. You've been on the big stage and you

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,560
know what it's like when you get in that flow state and everything's just happening all on its

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,399
own. And it's the best example of flow I ever had in my life. Like the process just started taking

77
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,939
care of itself.

78
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,819
I watched myself prepare my pole, go to my approach mark. And then with no hesitation,

79
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,819
the jump started and felt good from the first step. And it was just about not getting it wrong

80
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:51,660
after that. And it was my best jump for the day. And yeah, amazing to in that moment to have all

81
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,480
that come together. And it comes down to something I'm sure we'll talk a lot about later, which is

82
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,360
vision. I had a very clear vision of that moment from a long way out and rehearsed that moment so

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,920
many times.

84
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,860
And in the lead up to that day, and then when it presented itself, it's like I'd done it a thousand

85
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,139
times already. It felt easy and natural.

86
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,100
It's making the hair stand on the back of my neck, Steve. Clearly, we all know that moment and

87
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,360
understand what it means. But I hear and looking at you tell that story again, that flow state,

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,620
that athlete, if you get that once or twice in your life, it's just a magical experience. To get

89
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,879
it at the moment that you wanted it more than any other, to me, is just remarkable. But as you said,

90
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,939
I know you visualizing that moment, and I know you visualizing that moment, and I know you visualizing

91
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,540
what you want to achieve has been a huge part of your success. Can you delve into that a little

92
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,160
bit? You seem to operate well by just having this crystal clear picture and then working

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,120
backwards. Is that a fair way to describe it? Yeah, that's me. Finally, I've just watched the

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,639
Arnie documentary on Netflix. I could just finish watching that with my wife, Katia, the last couple

95
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,079
of days. And so much stuff that he said resonates with me. He said the same thing, and he said it in

96
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,939
a way that really spoke to me. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. I think that's what I'm

97
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,160
trying to do. I think that's what I'm trying to do. I think that's what I'm trying to do. I think

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,439
he's basically lived in the future. And I feel like, and I'm not great company sometimes because

99
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:17,139
of that, but my head's so often down the road. And I've got to really, that's the easy thing for me

100
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,120
to do. That's the kind of the normal operating mode for me is to be at this point down the road

101
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,800
when all of the plans have come together and been realized and all of that's happened. The hard thing

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
for me to do is actually be present and enjoy the moment, enjoy the process and all of that sort of

103
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,939
stuff. So, yeah, I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think

104
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,720
it's a bit of a blessing and a curse having that kind of mindset and that brain that works that

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,560
way. But for me, you're right. The vision is really straightforward. And then I feel like

106
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,699
aside from that, I'm just a very practical person who takes that thing, which some might say is

107
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,160
unachievable or impossible, but then figuring out the possible steps that you can take to get there

108
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,680
that unlock what might seem improbable or impossible into really achievable, doable next

109
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,500
steps. And then just slowly working through that process with that clear vision in mind.

110
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,939
And Steve, it's fascinating to me. I must admit, I can relate to that. A couple of people know me

111
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,399
well talking about you having a crystal ball and that you almost a few chapters ahead start talking

112
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,019
about what life's going to look like in an extended period of time. And I'm a bit like you. I can dream

113
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:30,100
in that state really happily, but I have to work hard to get back into exactly as that. So I've

114
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,659
spoken to many people like that, but does that work the same for you in terms of,

115
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,759
say, where you want to live or what your work life looks like? Is that something that's happening

116
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,559
for you all the time? All of it, it's a curse. Every bit of it. It's like, what's family life

117
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,940
going to be like? What's holidays going to be like? What's our house going to be like? All of

118
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,860
those sorts of things. I spend myself a lot of time down there. And then it frustrates my wife

119
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,419
a lot because I'll be like, I've got this vision. And then because I'm thinking so far out as well,

120
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,320
like all the variables change. So then all of a sudden the vision will change. I'm like, well,

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,019
it's still, it's just evolving now. Like I'm evolving it just five years at a time. I'm not

122
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,440
like changing my mind. It's just sort of, it's moving. Like it's moving based on the variables

123
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,159
changing. I guess you kind of work ahead of occurring and you get to respond earlier based

124
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,139
on the information at hand. And also I think you interpret the information that comes to you

125
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,740
differently. Like if you've got this vision for the future and you're like, here's where I'm going

126
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,220
to go. And it's based on the assumptions I have today. New information comes to hand and you're

127
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,139
like, oh, actually that's, that's contrary to what I thought. Like how does,

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,980
how does that impact on the vision? Vision's still viable. Vision gets better. Vision dies.

129
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,480
Like you could, you've got that opportunity to play that earlier than I guess reacting and

130
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,919
responding later. And, you know, assuming it's all going to be fine.

131
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,179
We'll have to introduce Cartier to Beck. They might need a joint counselling session.

132
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,019
Steve, it sounds eerily similar.

133
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,799
It's a tough gig.

134
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,279
And do you think that was a bit of a superpower for you when you applied that to something like

135
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,200
winning Olympic gold medal and jumping the magical six meter

136
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,539
mark that because you can live in that state so comfortably, it meant that you were able to then,

137
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,200
as you said, look at the variables, understand what it was going to take. Do you think that's,

138
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,139
was part of why that worked for you?

139
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,139
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I think I break it down into three things when I talk about this. So

140
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:25,720
there's, there's vision, plan and purpose. And I think vision is being able to clearly see what

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,879
it is you're going to do. And in my sport, it was easy. So you said the date, 22nd of August,

142
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,759
2008, bird's nest in Beijing.

143
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,860
I knew what the stadium would look like. I could put myself inside that stadium on the pole vault

144
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,139
run up. It's on the D running between the a hundred meter start and the 200 meter start and see

145
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,980
myself jumping a bar in that environment. I've never been to Beijing before, but I know what

146
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,639
it's going to be like. I know what a stadium will be like. I can be there. So vision's easy. Yeah.

147
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,460
Having that moment, the bars around six meters, you've got one jump to win. I can create that

148
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:03,200
scenario. That's easy. Then how do you get to there? How do you be in the physical shape?

149
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,360
How do you, how do you have a preparation that's going to put you there? So you're in the window,

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,799
you're in the mix that that's from experience, like coupling together, you know, your good and

151
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,860
bad experiences. What does that look like? And then how do you build a plan around that? This

152
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,120
is a bit that's challenging because there's a lot of dreamers out there that can say, I can have a

153
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,059
vision of what the future might be look like. But it's like, there's one step in the process where

154
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,000
there's like this mental gap that I just don't believe I can jump it. It's a bridge too far.

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,299
How do I, how do I get from being a 500,

156
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,179
five meter 50 pole vaulted or 570 pole vaulted? I just can't see how I get faster or stronger or

157
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,379
improve this element of my technique, what that might be to get there. And as soon as there's that

158
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,240
gap, your brain knows that, right? Like your brain knows that I can't really believe in this vision

159
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,220
because there's no viable pathway for me to get there. Whereas if you see a map and you're like,

160
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,240
okay, here's my target. I'm going to Sydney. I'm going to drive up the human. There's a road and

161
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,259
I drive up the human. I'm there. Then you're like, cool. I believe I'll be in Sydney in 10 hours.

162
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,200
So a simple plan that clearly shows you that maps out the way to the vision is, is critical.

163
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,720
And if there's any bit that's not, you're not saying I can do that with belief, then

164
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,659
you've got to reassess the plan and break that down into smaller chunks that might be more

165
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:21,259
achievable. And I think you've got those two things, the vision and the plan, what people

166
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,019
struggle with is that daily purpose, but the plan's a link. So if you've got the plan, then

167
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:33,299
each day with purpose, you can turn up and say, I'm going to do this bit of it because I know it's

168
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,080
the larger body of work that's going to get me to, to the place that we're trying to get to.

169
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,299
It's a brilliant description, Steve. I'm completely fascinated by it. I love that you've got

170
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,480
that in such a system. And I think the important element maybe is the last one you spoke about to

171
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,940
me is that people achieve great things with purpose and everyone, even when you've got

172
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,779
great purpose, you still got to grind your way through. It's not every day is just joy,

173
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,019
is it? When you're trying to- Most of it's boring. Most of it's the boring

174
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,299
bits, you know, like the little things you've got to do, like just each day, just tick the box edge,

175
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,700
and then you look back and you're like, man, we did so much over that period of time.

176
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,980
And you can't do those boring bits unless you've got the exciting big vision at the end that you're

177
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,639
working towards. That's the fuel, you know, like that's what's driving you. That's what's pulling

178
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,139
you forward. I try and keep things as simple as possible. And I've spoken about this for a long

179
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,299
time, probably only the last 12 to 18 months, I've been able to get it that simple for myself to be

180
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:31,340
able to put into words how it feels to have a big campaign with a big goal that has lots of little

181
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,200
steps in it. But I could never-

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,000
I explained to people why every day I was like, I get out of bed and I'm going. I never really

183
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,340
understood why other people didn't. There's some people that are just driven without those other

184
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,759
elements. But for me, that was what created it, a clear vision and a really simple plan.

185
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,759
And I want to get to in a minute how you've been able to translate that into another chapter. I

186
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,759
think Olympic gold, everyone can understand, can't you? And that is a real, as you said,

187
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,980
that's a, you know, I like the way you say an easy vision. It's not necessarily that, but easy,

188
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,960
easy for some, but an easy one to picture, but then to execute it.

189
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,059
Yeah.

190
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,679
How do you then do that? Not many athletes find a second chapter, which I want to talk to you about.

191
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,059
I want to ask you about the courage part to me, because I still look and think, I always admire

192
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,080
any sport at the highest possible. It doesn't matter what it is. I think there's something

193
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,360
that you, but to me, to put a stick in the ground, launch yourself six meters in the air,

194
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,519
did that still, was there still a courage element for you running down that every time,

195
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,100
or had you overcome that and it was just something you felt comfortable with?

196
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:31,620
No, there was always, for me, a fear factor. Like I came to pole vault late. I started when I was 15.

197
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,039
So first time I came to pole vault, I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

198
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,720
I touched a pole vault pole, 15 years old. And Mondo DePlantis, who everyone's going to watch

199
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,179
in Paris next year, or the world championships next month in Budapest. Mondo started when he was

200
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:50,100
five. So you watch Mondo pole vault, and it's like watching a fish swim. It's like second nature,

201
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,200
really easy for him. And Steve, he's breaking all the world records at the moment, isn't he?

202
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,720
World record holder. He's jumped six meters and 22 centimeters. He's gone six centimeters higher

203
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,019
than Sergei Bubka. He's unbelievable, right? And a freak.

204
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,320
He's a freak athlete physically, but the thing that I see when I look at him is how natural and

205
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,240
seamless and frictionless his vault is. And he started when he was five. I jumped five meters

206
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,360
within 18 months or two years of starting pole vault. So I was really fast. I was like 17 when

207
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:28,200
I jumped five meters from zero. It took him 10 years to jump five meters. So he had all of this

208
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,379
skill building at this lower level, like less risk, no fear.

209
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,159
So now when he's jumping six meters, it's like, well, that's no different to him jumping four

210
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,899
meters or five meters or whatever, because he's built up that kind of resilience within the sport

211
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,500
over such a long period of time. He has a toolbox that I could never have imagined having in terms

212
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,019
of how he can adjust on the runway, how he can adjust his jump in the air, because he's gone

213
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,440
through all of these different phases of jumping with different amounts of speed and strength and

214
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,240
different techniques that have all evolved over time. So I love watching him jump. I'm totally

215
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,019
jealous of it because it looks so easy for him. And it was hard. It was hard for me to jump.

216
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,700
It was really hard for me. I had decent natural speed. I was sort of, I had that. I don't think

217
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,879
I ran technically like biomechanically particularly well, personally, like good speed. And I had one

218
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,539
good thing, which was aggressive shoulder drop in my jump. And those two things were enough for me to

219
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:26,440
pull together a really good five-year window of elite pole vaulting, but it was never easy.

220
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,500
I always felt like I was on the edge, like I had to be fully there to make it work.

221
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,799
And is that why,

222
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,940
he's so unique and breaking records is that not many, you know, most people were great athletes

223
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,000
and then they turned to pole vaulting. Your story is probably the most common path. There's very few

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,720
find it at five years of age. Am I right in saying that?

225
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,740
Yeah. Well, there's a generation now starting to come through whose dads were pole vaulters. So

226
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,320
Mondo's dad was a pole vaulter or their dads were their coaches, like who started coaching them

227
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
quite a bit younger. There's more and more coming through where that sort of seems to be a trend,

228
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
like second generation kids that have been around it for their whole lives.

229
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,099
Um, and they, they just look more natural. And the other, the other element as well is like,

230
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,099
we're saying it was, you always, I grew up in the era where they're all big guys, pole vaulting,

231
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,140
like 90 kilos was not uncommon for a pole vaulter. And the guys are doing well now,

232
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:24,839
70 to 80. Um, and so like lighter frames, finding the same heights using smaller equipment. And

233
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,980
that's like less stressful on the mind, less stressful on the body to do that as well. So,

234
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,019
whereas I was like, I had a big equipment as big as anyone really used that has,

235
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,740
its own kind of fear factor, you know, more risk, more weight that you're carrying in your hand,

236
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,599
you feel it physically. So there's a lot of elements there that kind of come into why is

237
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,059
it scary or why does fear come into play? But I think for me, the biggest thing was coming to it

238
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,559
late and trying to keep up with my progression, which happened quite quickly and quicker than I

239
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,339
could kind of adapt to it. You do come from athletic royalty though, Steve, your mum was

240
00:17:55,339 --> 00:18:01,000
an Olympian in 1972. She won a Commonwealth game silver. Your dad's a four-time national champion

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,759
and a Commonwealth games representative. What,

242
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,359
what sort of influence was the athletic path always going to be you or did you sample other

243
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:14,059
stuff? Uh, no, I, it wasn't always necessarily for me. I always loved it. Uh, but I love playing

244
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,339
footy as well. Like I, I love my footy team that I played with growing up, my junior team and the

245
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:25,180
guys I played with and always really enjoyed that. And, uh, and then did athletics in the summer,

246
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,599
uh, was sort of my, my split and, and was doing that up until I was 17.

247
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:43,400
Nearly 18 and just had to, had to make the call. I think like I was, I took a year off in 99. I took

248
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,400
a year off playing footy for the, for my club to focus on pole vault training. And it got like

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,440
halfway through the season. And I was like, I just miss playing footy so much. Like, I just,

250
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,700
I just want to go and play with the guys. So I went and played the last six games

251
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,019
with, with my local club, with, um, with Baldwin. And,

252
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,000
I'd just done like, I didn't realize I'd just done like the perfect footy preseason. So I got

253
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,140
faster, stronger. I'd been in the gym and I went out there and all of a sudden I was like, how easy

254
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,539
is footy? Like I was getting touches, jumping all over guys, taking marks. And like off those six

255
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:22,259
games, got asked to go and train, do a preseason with Oakley Chargers. And they were the ones and,

256
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,259
and sort of, I know they did like David Park and scratch matches back then where, you know,

257
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,099
they'd put two Chargers teams together and figure out who would get on the list. And

258
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,019
so I played those games. And at the end of the season, I was like, oh, I'm going to play with

259
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,839
them. And at the end of that, they were like, well, what are you going to choose? Like, you know,

260
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,700
you're going to do footy if you are sort of, you're all in the footy or are you going to do

261
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,440
your pole vault? And I was like, I didn't realize I had to choose. If you're going to make me choose,

262
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,079
then I think, I think I want to go to the Olympics. So I want to, I'm going to go that way. I feel

263
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,059
like at that point when I could see the pathway to, when I was training with athletes, they were

264
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,480
preparing for Sydney and I could see the pathway to the Olympics. That's when it kind of was clear

265
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,000
for me, which way I wanted to go. And we've seen that brilliant crossover, Steve, uh, you know,

266
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,619
Mark Blitzhouse comes to mind, who was chasing Olympic, uh, dreams as a steeplechaser and his

267
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:11,700
conversion back to Australian football has been an incredible story in lots of ways. And, uh,

268
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:16,480
you know, two-time best and fairest winner. Was there a thought in your mind that there was a

269
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,220
second career or you did such an extended period of success in athletics? It was probably

270
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,680
beyond you by that stage. There was only one time where I thought about it a little bit.

271
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,539
And that was when Carmichael Hunt and Isabel Folau sort of got

272
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:37,019
contracts. And at the same time, it was when the sub rule was in and I was like,

273
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,059
I reckon I could come on and have a pretty good last quarter and a half of 40

274
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:46,160
and, you know, like come on with and have, you know, some effective speed and

275
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,220
all that sort of stuff. That was the only time it was half a thought, but

276
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,960
having since I played, I played a bit of country 40 with Shane Crawford when I was 39. So just

277
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,039
a year and a half ago and having played three back-to-back games on consecutive weekends,

278
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,079
the reality of that and the fantasy of that are very different. In your thirties or late

279
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,819
twenties, you don't bounce back like you do when you're 19. So that, that, um, that

280
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:14,799
fantasy, thankfully I got to live it out on a very small scale and realize what an absolute

281
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,079
fantasy it was. It's bloody tough. And I've got a mountain of respect for players that

282
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,859
go out and get through a 23 round season.

283
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:25,019
Having understood your mindset more clearly now and understand when you get a vision and

284
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:29,779
a plan and put passion into it, uh, nothing would have been, uh, beyond your capabilities,

285
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:30,380
uh,

286
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,960
from my point of view. You, you, you married an outstanding athlete. You mentioned cardio

287
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,539
earlier. You've got three kids and you see them daily on the, on the home front. What

288
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,240
sort of leader are you like on the home front with that athletic profile? Do you, do you

289
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,859
allow them to choose their own path? How does that play out?

290
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,700
Oh yeah, I'm involved. I'm a little bit involved. Like I'm more involved than my parents were.

291
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,960
You asked me, you asked me how my parents were as well. Sorry. And, and I think as, as

292
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,859
parents, they were amazing. Like particularly during my pole vault career, they were the

293
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:00,519
most supporting,

294
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:06,119
supportive parents on the home front and let my coach, my, my technical, my, my track

295
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,599
coach, like take care of things on the track. And that meant we had a really great relationship

296
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,220
through all of that. And they understood there wasn't the easiest times when I was sort of

297
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,599
like late, like last couple of years of high school, first couple of years is a trying

298
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,619
to transition from junior to senior athletics. It's hard. It's a hard process to go through.

299
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,279
Only, only looking back, I can appreciate how supportive they were and how much they

300
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,519
put up with my moods, the challenging kid I would have been as I was a teenager. And

301
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:34,839
I was going through that. They were great. And only, you know, only once you have kids,

302
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,380
you understand what that would be like, and you're going through it now with yours. So

303
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,220
they were amazing on that front. With my kids, I want them just to try everything and find

304
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,920
their passion. I thought my experience I had in the world through being a pole vaulter

305
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,960
was amazing. And all I wanted to do was learn it a bit younger. So I'm teaching them to

306
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,140
pole vault just because for a couple of reasons, it's fun. We enjoy it as long as, you know,

307
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,440
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

308
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,119
the offer is always, do you want to go on pole vault today? It's not, we're going, do

309
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,019
you want to go on pole vault today? If they say yes, we go. If they say no, we don't. If

310
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,720
we get there and they want to, we do. If we get there and they don't want to, we don't.

311
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,519
And we'll find something else fun to do. We're going to play in the sand pit or do something

312
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,460
like that. But I want them to have that skillset there early so that they can have fun with

313
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,039
an event. Because the one bit of it that was hard for me was the mental side of it. Whereas

314
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,400
if they learn good technique and they learn how to do this really fun thing young, it

315
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,200
should be easy and enjoyable for the rest of their life. So long as they don't feel

316
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,019
pressure. And that's what I want for them for a couple of reasons. It's a great sport.

317
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,220
It opens up a whole bunch of opportunity. And if they ever want to go to college in

318
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,799
the US, like a pole vault scholarship's gold, there's just not many pole vaulters around

319
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,799
to get on a track program. So if they want to pursue that pathway, like their, their

320
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,160
mom went to Texas state university. That was, you know, she had the college scholarship

321
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,180
experience. If they want to go that way, having a background as a pole vaulter,

322
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,480
it's a pretty nice way to, a free education and a great experience in the US.

323
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,839
I love the way you described it, isn't it? You're sharing a passion, but it comes from

324
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,200
them only and their call and their decision. And, and, uh, fascinating to see. I always

325
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,779
have this theory, Steve, you can't manufacture passion. It's, uh, impossible to do it, but

326
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,420
yeah, you create the opportunities, don't you? And you support them wherever that path

327
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,980
takes and you hope they find something that they loved as much as, as you clearly did.

328
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,880
The transition from, you know, the incredible success, you're an Olympic gold medalist.

329
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,680
And I mentioned the continued success afterwards of world championships and to do that so consistently

330
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,059
for a period of time is a remarkable achievement, but then it ends. And like a lot of people

331
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,880
with sport, it's like, where do you find that again, that next passion? And you've done

332
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,039
that with great success. You were the CEO, uh, until pretty recently of a pretty massive

333
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,380
company and you tried a lot of different things. How did you find the skillset applying, uh,

334
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,940
from your athletic career into your, into your work life afterwards? How, what, what

335
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
served you well?

336
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,880
First one is knowing when you're loved.

337
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,440
Like knowing when something gets you excited and knowing that's possible. Cause I think

338
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,319
a lot of people go through life, not realizing you can really enjoy and really love and create

339
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,380
an environment of fun in your work. And I was really able to do that in my sport. And

340
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,119
that's what I was seeking in life. So constantly looking for that. And if it's not there asking,

341
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,319
like being critical and saying, well, why not? Like, is it the environment? Is it the

342
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,880
role? Is it me? Like what's, what's missing? Why this isn't like lighting the air? Why's

343
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me?

344
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why

345
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why

346
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me?

347
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is

348
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me?

349
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is

350
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it

351
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,559
how do you find a passion in your work so knowing that that has to be a part of it is the starting

352
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:46,400
point and then the next piece is is the vision piece like being able to as a leader in a business

353
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,819
understand where we're going being able to you know one of the things from my sport was having

354
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:57,759
a huge number of variables that you had to take into account to make a decision and and business

355
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,220
and and is very much like that being able to like see the big picture be able to understand your

356
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,799
kind of key metrics that you you've got available to help you make your decisions

357
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,779
and then commit commit to a decision make a call and then live with the consequences of that and

358
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:15,720
adapt as you move forward so it's those kind of things that come out of sport that are really

359
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,559
really useful in life like you just every week every year you've got to look at the variables

360
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,279
make a decision come up with the plan execute on the plan review the plan iterate as you go and at

361
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,859
the end you've got a result and it's black and white like

362
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:37,119
it's clear and so if you can if you can find the same way to kind of replicate that in your

363
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,420
business life then it's a pretty good way of of operating and if you can support those around you

364
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,339
to do the same it's it's useful yeah brilliant answer steve and you you also sampled a lot of

365
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,880
things on the way you started off with some talent management uh you did a tech startup you had um

366
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,000
you know restaurants and perhaps some of those are still playing out as well were they just you

367
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,119
sampling and trying to find as you said that passion was that how that path played out oh

368
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,200
yeah

369
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,519
all different so it's been a journey i think i started in property so my background is i did a

370
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,319
property degree at rmit in melbourne and got on a graduate role at stockland one of australia's

371
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:21,539
leading listed developers and so i from 2002 to 2006 was was training and working um within that

372
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,000
business so i'd work 20 hours a week and train 30 to 35 hours a week on top of that

373
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,740
um i did that in melbourne until 2005 started 2006

374
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,579
and then after the melbourne commonwealth games moved to perth and took a job in the stockland

375
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:44,960
office in perth so i had this i had my my career going early and that was off um off my first coach

376
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,599
mark stewart he was a he was a volunteer coach effectively and his full-time job was a university

377
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,940
lecturer at rmit and a lecturer in economics and so it was very important for him to see his

378
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,799
athletes with a life after sport not putting all their eggs in that basket particularly athletics

379
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,240
your likelihood of making any money's super slim so you've got to be prepared for life after sport

380
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,359
and so he was very supportive in training working around study and work and so i had a great

381
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,740
foundation uh from him and from and from those early days and from that work experience i had

382
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,400
with stockland and then you know start of 2007 i've gotten to world number one in 2006 start of

383
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,819
2007 you know just over 12 months out from beijing i was like i want to i've got to be a full-time

384
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:39,940
athlete for this window no stone unturned full focus to get the result so um made that decision

385
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,799
at that point in time and was was a good decision and was a full-time athlete through till 2010 no

386
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,680
other focus and then at that point like the long-term brain starts kicking in and i'm like

387
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,079
this isn't going to last forever what what's next and so started a small athlete management

388
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,579
business or i'm sports group it's still a business that's around today it does track and field

389
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,960
athlete representation curtis marshall's represented by oram and and stefan who still

390
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,859
runs that business out of germany so i was involved with that for 10 years in the end but

391
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:14,240
mainly in a supporting role and um not nothing too significant there for me but you know it's a

392
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,460
great business that supports a lot of athletes um get around europe and get to competitions and

393
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,539
um have the experiences that i had

394
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:21,660
over the years and i've been doing that for a long time and i've been doing that for a long time

395
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:29,539
um and then a year later was talking to amin sullivan we were both living in perth i i'd

396
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:34,460
started up with a mate like a like a small butcher outlet at um the subiaco markets because there was

397
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,440
none there and we lived nearby and we're like we would buy meat if it was here and other people

398
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,819
might so we just sort of were playing with that with a mate of ours who owned a butcher

399
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:47,119
and then amin had opened a cafe nearby and so we were supplying him and we were talking about

400
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,539
things and we found this amazing space um that we're

401
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,140
we thought could be a really good restaurant in perth it was on top of the freemantle surf

402
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:04,220
life-saving club and then amin myself and jamie dwyer hockey player um started a restaurant

403
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,759
not really you know amin had good experience he'd won celebrity master chef he had a profile in the

404
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:15,119
space and all of us thought this location is amazing um the perth food scene was really

405
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,980
evolving at that point in time if we can get a great chef on board and create a great experience

406
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,400
with this location we can have some success

407
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,400
that was a great business it just celebrated it's 10 it's called bib and tucker it just

408
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,099
celebrated its 10 year anniversary a couple of months ago um i just exited that myself i sold

409
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,900
my shares to scott bridger who's the chef amazing chef you know poured his heart and soul into that

410
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,019
restaurant and it's so great that he's got a big big stake in that restaurant as they move forward

411
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:46,319
and um so it's now amin scott and jamie taking that thing on but you know there's nothing that

412
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,380
teaches you more about the value of a dollar than running a restaurant like that it's hard

413
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:58,500
hard work big turnover high risk lots of staff big overhead like it's um there is a lot in that

414
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,799
and you know every single day your trading conditions are different based on the weather

415
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,279
and what's going on around you and what the parking situation is like like all these things

416
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,480
that you know you have to factor in but you see the benefit of having quality reporting like seeing

417
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,019
what the what the metrics are every day and seeing the trends over time because i was remote i was in

418
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:21,460
the u.s and i was in melbourne but i would get my daily reports and i would get my daily reports and

419
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,519
i would get my daily reports and i would get my daily reports and i would get my daily reports and

420
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,960
i'd i'd have the questions that i'd be asking you know this looks like this is trending the

421
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,279
wrong way like what's going on how can we fix it what are the opportunities so lots of lots

422
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:34,779
amazing lessons from that business and amin to his credit scott's done an amazing job with the

423
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:39,819
food but amin is a business owner just he did the right thing by jamie and i by really taking it on

424
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:43,740
and being the general manager and doing a sensational job there and really grateful for

425
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,140
what he did on that because you don't always get out of restaurants with your money you come from

426
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,519
hospitality you know how tough it can be i know well and i i just you know i've been in the

427
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,200
three olympians opening a restaurant what could possibly go wrong steve without any experience and

428
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,400
and i love it because you know we always get advised out of doing things but you know the

429
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,220
curiosity and the learning and you're applying like you know you're thinking and your logic to

430
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,019
it so to turn that is a great success stories and you know we've as a family been in the pub game

431
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:15,140
and hospitality life and everyone's going to open a pub and and i love when people do because you

432
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,220
need creative people to do it to the lessons are long and and quick sometimes at the same time so

433
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,839
i love hearing that story it's fascinating you know the property development world

434
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,900
for a lot of people we know there's enormous opportunities in it but where do you find the

435
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,079
passion it's you know i can see the passion jump in a high bar and win an olympic gold why does

436
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:42,819
property development provide that that passion for you um it's a very australian thing i think

437
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:48,779
probably there's two things that we talk about a sport and property so um i think everyone's got

438
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,500
an interest in it in australia and i always did growing up

439
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:59,740
um for me also i think the more you get into property development it's a problem solving game

440
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:07,559
and that's always what i've seen myself as so someone that can can uh it's a long-term game

441
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,299
you're going to have a long-term vision you're going to have patience so it takes a long time

442
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:15,700
to evolve you've got to think now about things that are going to be issues in four to five years

443
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,500
time um and solve the problems along the way what are the what are the barriers you're running into

444
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,619
and how do you how do you work with people to get around that because whilst it looks like it's

445
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:30,339
property it's a people game and it's all about relationships and building a team that can that

446
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:37,660
can together come come as one and and get to an outcome so it's um it's always exciting it's

447
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,839
always challenging and the rewards are big and the risks are high so it feels in a lot of ways like

448
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,779
my sport did um and i like being that environment you know like that risk appetite you get when you

449
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:58,400
mine um holds you in good stead you know like understand the risks be sure you can live with

450
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,460
the consequences and then make your decisions and commit so when you're doing what you did

451
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,619
in the first part of your life you're a leader for yourself effectively now you're leading other

452
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:14,139
people and you get the chance to to do that on a daily basis what what type of ceo have you been

453
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,260
what type of leader are you in the current space that you're working um yeah that's

454
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:27,099
so that the biggest challenge i faced was that so under there's a huge difference between

455
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,360
having your own vision and then turning that vision into a shared vision by

456
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,780
broader group like that's that's a really hard thing to do and i probably didn't understand how

457
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,059
hard that was at first i assumed you tell people once and then we're all saying the same thing

458
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,519
and we're all running in the same direction and that just couldn't be anything further from the

459
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,239
truth you know even if you do one beautiful presentation you're not going to be able to

460
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,159
that really shows people like that everyone interprets it interprets things so differently

461
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:03,260
and then also like having a really clear back to purpose plan vision breaking that down to the

462
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,360
simplest plan so everyone can see each day what the element is that you're working on how does

463
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,440
it fit into the overall plan how's that going to get us to our vision and finding 50 different ways

464
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,840
not one to explain that story so that over time it becomes a shared vision and understanding that

465
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,559
there's no one trick that's going to get everyone seeing things in the same way

466
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,739
persistence varied messages varied mediums of trying to get that message across

467
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:35,280
and just doing it over and over again so it's almost boring everyone's like yeah we get it and

468
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
that's probably the point when you're like okay it feels like if everyone's saying this is boring

469
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,840
then we're probably all of a sudden seeing the same thing and we can talk about it in the same

470
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,480
way and we can see the pathway that we're going to get there so that was a challenge understanding

471
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,820
that and it took a long time

472
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,599
but i mean i was one of the leaders at resumax group and the other one was aussie kia

473
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:03,440
and he's the managing director of resumax group and took a chance on me put me into a leadership

474
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,139
role early and it's been my greatest business mentor the the six years that we have spent

475
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:18,119
working together have been just unbelievable what i've learned from him seeing how his brain works

476
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,659
you know understanding how to deal with a crisis understanding how to deal with adversity

477
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:32,440
in business just there's um there's no university that could have taught me this

478
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,559
and then and then to be side by side with a guy like that working through the covid years

479
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:44,539
particularly a building business and someone in construction as well like just a huge amount of

480
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:49,059
experience that um we're able to get through and the fact that we're able to get through that with

481
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,179
a strong united

482
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,000
amalgamated team pretty much the same team we started with at the beginning of it is um

483
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,300
is an experience that i'm really grateful for it's the hardest thing ever but experience i'm

484
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:07,440
really grateful for um and that i got to do it with oz um fully supported and fully fully um

485
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,420
fully backed by him was um unbelievable yeah brilliant story to to understand it leads

486
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,900
really well steve to something that we're really passionate about working this space and

487
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,019
i love uh out of all the things i've done media wise to sit down and and

488
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:25,900
and listen to stories like yours but we see patterns in the way people lead and the success

489
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,659
leaves clues is something i often say that there is some consistency as you've described before it

490
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,179
shows up in different ways but love uh finding out where the patterns are and what i ask you

491
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:40,280
some dimensions of leadership that we think are uh you know quite consistent regardless of the

492
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,679
space you're in and we start with this sense of self-leadership uh steve that we feel like it's

493
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,800
hard to impact others unless you understand your own sense of self-leadership when i ask you that

494
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:55,460
does it mean to you um it's a hard one it was in the it was in the quest you know you might get

495
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,639
asked about self-leadership and i don't really know what that means like to be honest that's my

496
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,420
honest answer i'm like i don't really know what self-leadership means so what does it mean to me

497
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,559
i don't know it's like um i'm a very like i learn by doing things is my piece right so and the

498
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,179
biggest learnings i've had is when i've i've just been really honest about what i don't know

499
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
being and that i've

500
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:26,639
i feel like and i don't know if it's going to answer your question or not but but i'm i'm no

501
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,880
expert in anything except for probably jumping six meters with a fiberglass pole other than that i'm

502
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,199
not an expert in anything and i love that but i do know a little bit about a lot of things

503
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,860
and i love seeing how things connect and i and i love being around people who know a lot about

504
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:48,800
things and all of my my learnings and my growth has been about putting myself

505
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,980
putting myself

506
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,420
in the kind of middle of an environment where i'm not the expert but i'm surrounded by really

507
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:02,280
clever people and just assisting the group to get to the right outcome and that is super exciting

508
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,860
for me and i've i've done that enough times where like the imposter syndrome is gone and i'm not i

509
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,380
don't feel like i need to know everything because what i know is whatever whatever environment i go

510
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,199
into or whatever team we pull together there's going to be someone that knows we've just got to

511
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,739
leave the space for the kind of for the answer to come out for the expert to step forward and for

512
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,360
the solution to come up if we can define the problem properly the solution will present

513
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,659
and then we can work together on a plan you know then then it's just a planning exercise after that

514
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:39,039
which i'm comfortable with i'm comfortable i can come up with a plan so i don't know if that's

515
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,320
leadership or self-awareness or whatever but that's that's the one thing that i've learned

516
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,480
the most out of was just being in the deep end in the middle of things and realizing you don't

517
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,940
need to know someone knows or if we don't

518
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,219
we can figure it out the information's out there and being really comfortable with that

519
00:39:54,219 --> 00:40:01,940
um that's been a that's been a big learning for me such a brilliant answer steve and i love the

520
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,739
way you answered that and it's profound because yeah some people say that to me i don't even

521
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,239
understand the question self-leash when i ask it though that's actually a reasonably common

522
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,079
response but what you just took us on then to me is is unique because a lot of us live this sort of

523
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,659
facade where well if i show you that i don't know the answer that's going to be a sign of

524
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,539
and so we we sort of make it up and we end up not allowing the answer to come we can't get proper

525
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,300
help or we can't collaborate properly because we don't want to be seen to not know and the way you

526
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,679
describe that to me is brett i can imagine in the restaurant you wouldn't have pretended to be an

527
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:37,179
expert on opening a restaurant because you weren't but you would have asked some curious questions

528
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:42,059
knowing you you would have been right in the middle of asking it yeah well how does this work

529
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,059
like how explain to me how this works i'm interested like and then and then all of a

530
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,820
sudden you know then all of a sudden the person who's come to you with a problem is like oh

531
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,019
it's because we're not doing that bit that i know about and yeah you just got to prompt prompt the

532
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:58,900
smart people to step back a little bit from the detail and then they're like oh yeah that's right

533
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,519
i know i know what i'm doing yeah yeah there's actually not a problem and i love the intelligence

534
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,099
and someone like you understanding your ability to be that connector and bring those pieces together

535
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:13,539
and execute a plan with with passion it's uh it's profound we see another dimension of leadership

536
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:18,599
steve around people in roles of leadership constant constantly conscious now of how they

537
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,480
that that's something they think about positive impact is that something that occurs to you

538
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,639
it's a weakness for me um it's a weakness for me and i think it's a weakness for a lot of people

539
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:37,500
that come from old school high performance sport like maybe not the recent high performance sport

540
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,599
i think that ethos has changed a little bit but i was looking for i was always as an athlete

541
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,579
looking for critical feedback um because i was like i know where i'm going like i just need to

542
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:49,960
worry about the things that are in the way like i'm not going to be able to do that i'm going to

543
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,320
i don't need to worry about it's going good like i know it's going good yeah fine but

544
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:01,880
what's not what's stopping us and i've been really guilty of just just going straight to okay here's

545
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,139
the problem here's how we're going to solve the problem rather than saying we're doing these seven

546
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:11,059
things amazingly um that is amazing that's an amazing piece of work this is great that's a

547
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:17,199
great bit of progress there but we've got this last piece here i just like especially when you're

548
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,940
busy and there's a lot on which certainly was the environment particularly

549
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,500
at resimax group is seven businesses in one you've got limited time and capacity for each one

550
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,659
my natural instinct was straight to the problem and the solution of the problem and then you move

551
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:35,360
on and then you you kind of don't think until afterwards about well that might have been

552
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,139
perceived as a bit of a negative bit of feedback to someone because i didn't mention this is going

553
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,099
great except for the last bit of it which we've just got to work on and then the whole thing's

554
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:49,960
great um definitely definitely a big weakness for me and something that every day i've been

555
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,599
i've got to work on still and we'll always have to because it's not my nature to focus on the good

556
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,420
my nature is to focus on the negative and fix it so being aware of that and trying to each day

557
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,940
do that is uh high on my list and i often fail yeah and i appreciate you sharing that we probably

558
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,599
came we did come out of the same era of sport where it's exactly the same and you just you

559
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,059
you get so used to the feedback that you crave it and you want it and you want it instantly and then

560
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,960
not realizing how blunt it can be and i had the same so comfortable with it yeah

561
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,480
it's like someone else would listen in and say you can't say that to someone it's like

562
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,139
it was meant from a good place i didn't mean it it was just trying to get to the point but i

563
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:33,159
probably feel very similar but you're right isn't it when you see you actually stopping

564
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:37,420
celebrating success you understand that's a healthier way even if it didn't come naturally

565
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,119
to you yeah and not even uh we definitely would do it like at a milestone point of view like

566
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,360
celebrate the successes each month and do all of that sort of stuff it's more in the moment

567
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,820
like that's the bit that i would struggle with because in the moment it's like it's action we're

568
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,039
we're not reflecting this is this is action solving this problem just taking the time to

569
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,039
realize that for everyone that's a big bit of their day and it's a big piece of their work and

570
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:06,739
you've got to in that moment recognize the positives and the growth that we've had and

571
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:11,019
then just talk on the net then get to the next step you know like that that's the challenge and

572
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:16,380
it's been good been good to learn that about myself and learn that it's part of me and do my

573
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,960
best to work on it the next dimension uh and you've given a brilliant answer to this

574
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,420
with leaders conscious of how they create and share a vision and i you know i've written down

575
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,079
some notes on what you said before because you described this in such a profound way that you

576
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,159
know was clear to you as an athlete but when you realize you had to bring a team along with you can

577
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,699
you give it a specific example you spoke about 45 different ways of having to do it and once you

578
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,980
felt people were bored that was a moment you thought you're on track is there can you describe

579
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,760
that in a in a specific example i think just the fact that i was able to walk away

580
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,480
as the ceo from this business is probably the best example so when i started it was a business that

581
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,039
was very much run with imagine a aussie as a central hub of this business and he he would he

582
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,400
would send out the tasks and the urgent business to do each day you know it would go out from him

583
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,260
each and every day here's what we're going to focus on today come back and let me know how you

584
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,699
went and then it just scaled beyond his ability to do that and so i came in to try and assist in

585
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:19,960
building a team and system the process and allow him to grow his capacity to do that and i think

586
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:26,119
even bigger and we're wildly successful in that because it mainly because of him mainly because

587
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:33,239
his capacity is so enormous his vision is so enormous his ability to understand and execute

588
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:40,360
commercially is unbelievable and my role was really sit behind that and make sure that then

589
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,780
where we're going because we're thinking three years ahead and the team's thinking about three

590
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,420
months ahead is to transpose that and then over the course of six years we went from

591
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,519
aussie leading to me and i was leading to then getting a senior management team that were really

592
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:59,679
clear on where we're going what they had to do to get there and their teams were then clear on what

593
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,639
they had to do and so it's just that evolution and so there's no one specific example it's just

594
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,079
doing that over and over again on terms of new products and new projects and new ways of doing

595
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:14,139
business and new systems that are in place over and over again until all of a sudden business

596
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:18,699
becomes a bit boring it's bigger there's more going on it's more interesting but it's not that

597
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:19,960
kind of fight or flight it's not that kind of fight or flight it's more interesting it's more

598
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,980
interesting every day when you turn up to the office and that's that's the best example that i

599
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:32,219
can give is that just consistency over time trying to make things simpler and clearer each and every

600
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:37,699
day has meant that yeah there's there's a group of leaders that all share the vision they all know

601
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:42,820
where they're going um they can do their work consistently every day and aussie's now got a

602
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,699
business that he can lead and um he can lead it with those senior leaders that are doing a fantastic

603
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:49,960
job with each of their parts of the business

604
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:56,179
and it was time for you to find a new challenge was that yeah i think um you know when we when we

605
00:46:56,179 --> 00:47:00,960
set up we we'd agreed with each other that's a five to ten year project that we would work on

606
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,860
together and it was you know it's sort of the minimum commitment like what's your minimum

607
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,920
commitment and you know we ticked past five years and then my long-term brain started ticking and

608
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,300
it's like well if we're through five already then we're going to be at 10 before we know it

609
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:19,139
i mean i started just thinking about what do i want to do i've loved running aussie's business

610
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:19,960
i've loved building a business and i've loved building a business and i've loved building a

611
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,380
his vision but if i was to design my very own one what would that look like i had a break and

612
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,820
had time and headspace for the first time since covid really and i just had a book and started

613
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,739
writing things down and out of that kind of came a business plan that i felt really passionate about

614
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:40,559
for um you know a shared value property development model um that you know where

615
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,380
you can partner with landowners you can partner with builders and you can have social impact

616
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,980
off the back of your property developments and that got me really excited and

617
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,000
it's it's you know i took it to oz and we spoke about it and he said and i know oz and that's not

618
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,099
that's not his passion area you know like that's not the thing that gets him out of bed every

619
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:04,420
morning but certainly something that had sparked something in me and he's as the amazing leader

620
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,559
that he was it's just like i'll support you in whatever you want to do so you know explore it

621
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,679
look into it we can work this thing out here and you know we came up together with this kind of

622
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,539
transition program of how you know we could we can set the business up for success if i wasn't there

623
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:19,960
um and he would say i'm not going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it

624
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,559
in rolling out my new venture you know i still consult back to ozzy on special projects like

625
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,820
he's been that good to me off the back of um the experience that we've had together that you know

626
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,980
i continue to help him with what he's doing he continues to be a mentor for me and i hope that

627
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,179
that is something that continues indefinitely he's um been huge influence on my life and um

628
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:48,400
you know the best leader that i've been around and um yeah i mean i just feel i feel grateful

629
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,559
more than that like it would have been so easy for him to just say okay well if you're out you're

630
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,159
out most people would in his position but he's not most people and that's what makes him special

631
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:03,480
and unique and it's why he's got the team that he has and and the support of his people like he does

632
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,739
and that's a massive learning for me and something that i would love to emulate myself what a great

633
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:13,579
leadership story and i love the chance to share that uh steve we know that changes people's lives

634
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:18,940
doesn't it when you you lead that way and you do it with care and support brilliant things happen

635
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,960
and and people like you and people like you and people like you and people like you and people like

636
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,380
you go on and do that as well a curiosity is a is a word we we use and hear a lot for leaders that

637
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,380
through curiosity that's how they approach getting better and they're learning and development does

638
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:37,639
that resonate with you yep 100 i think the one thing for me is like i've been interested like

639
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,619
that's that's that's the way i've always kind of looked at it curiosity is probably a better word

640
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:49,659
might adopt that um but um just be interested in things you know like i'm i'm the world's worst

641
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,960
and everyone around me will vouch for this i'm horrible with names like it's the worst and i'll

642
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,840
tell you why as soon as i meet someone the least interesting thing for me about them is their name

643
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,679
like i meet them and we start talking and then i'm like like i could meet you i can see someone's

644
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,880
face i could tell you where they worked what jobs they'd been on like an interesting story that they

645
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,900
told me all that sort of stuff but the name is gone because i just want to get into the stuff

646
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,880
you know like i want to i want to understand what they do and ask them questions about how that

647
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,659
works and that's come since having sort of an entrepreneurial mindset

648
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,260
i think at a certain if you're if you're an entrepreneur you'll get this like you understand

649
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:29,619
that as soon as you open that box all you start thinking about is how things work and that's that's

650
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:34,139
the curiosity bit for me as soon as i remember one day i was like i wonder if i can come up with an

651
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:38,239
idea for a business and i'm just going to sit on the couch and then think of an idea for a business

652
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,460
and up until this point i've never done anything like this and i sat down i just started thinking

653
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,219
and i was like well you start them thinking about problems and what problems are there to be solved

654
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,940
and i think the business i came up on the couch was like

655
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,360
um the last meter courier service so you know there's you know there's the big distance and

656
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,199
then there's the last mile and i was like well what about the last meter you know we've got

657
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,599
phones that people are carrying around what if i'm sitting at the cafe and someone delivers my

658
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,179
parcel to me in the cafe like how amazing would that be like it's it's probably a bit much but um

659
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,559
that's what i thought of at the time and i was like okay that's an idea there's no one doing

660
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:15,179
that out there right now that's that's an idea and then once you had the idea the idea is one thing

661
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:19,940
and uh and i think ideas are infinite like they're not

662
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,380
ideas aren't that valuable a lot of people would say they are but i don't think they're that valuable

663
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,820
what's valuable then is what are the fundamentals that sit behind operationalizing an idea like

664
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:35,460
that how does it work how does that idea work and if you can if you can work your way through

665
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,440
how an idea works that's the entrepreneurial mindset and that's where interest comes in so

666
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,340
you hear someone you're like oh what are you doing like how does that work okay and then

667
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,480
what and then you could understand if you've got that mindset like and what are the metrics like

668
00:51:49,980 --> 00:52:05,460
and and

669
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:11,179
one of the best project managers that we have in our business is a chef it was his training

670
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:16,400
is in chefing and he's one of the best project managers at resi max group but those two things

671
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,780
do come together there's a recipe and ingredients and there's the team and there's all those

672
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:32,059
And it's like, there's time constraints and all of these sorts of things that, and there's pressure and you can sort of see how they fit together when you're interested and you can, you start looking at kind of the components of something rather than just the end outcome.

673
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:40,139
So that's what I, that's where my curiosity is and the interest comes from that entrepreneur's mindset, I think, seeing how the bits work and the same with pole vault.

674
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,739
How do the bits of the pole vault come together to create the jump?

675
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,760
Yeah, I think that's my curiosity.

676
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,579
Fascinating insight into how you think.

677
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,699
Communicating with clarity is a dimension we see is a really common trait for leaders.

678
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,719
They understand that that's such an important part of how they're going to succeed.

679
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,719
How have you gone about that?

680
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:12,380
Yeah, I mean, that's the simplify the message, simplify the plan and then try and be consistent and then make it interesting.

681
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:13,440
That's the other piece.

682
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:16,739
Like it's got to be entertaining and interesting and inspire people.

683
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:28,019
Um, otherwise these days, particularly, particularly to recover, particularly when we're meeting in mediums like this, like over, over the internet, it's like, it's so easy for someone to find another screen.

684
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:30,960
It's so easy for someone to find something else to focus on.

685
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:36,519
If it's not short, sharp, clear to the point and entertaining, you'll lose, you will lose people.

686
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,880
So, uh, I feel like that's, um, some of the kind of can't be underestimated.

687
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,760
How important Steve's collaboration been for you?

688
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,519
Everything.

689
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,760
Yeah, because if you can't do anything by yourself, it's a non, it's a non-negotiable.

690
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,760
Yeah, brilliant answer.

691
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,760
And we, we've seen that, uh, you know, become more of a strength, isn't it?

692
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,760
If leaders understand that more and more now that away probably from the era we're in with hierarchy towards more collaboration.

693
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,760
Um, I think you've been ahead of most of my questions today, a bit like the way you think, but I get a sense.

694
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,760
So you might have a clear answer for this.

695
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

696
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,760
I spoke about my, I spoke about my parents and that's, that got me.

697
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,760
Yeah.

698
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,760
It goes without saying Oz and yeah, he's back around.

699
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,760
So Oz is not a classically trained executive Oz.

700
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,760
Um, he won't mind me saying this.

701
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
He was a hustler.

702
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,760
Like he, he was the kid that would make counterfeit clothes at high school and sell them to his mates.

703
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Like he was, he was trading things from, he was in the rag trade.

704
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:45,760
He went into hospitality, um, and everything he's done has, has been successful and he's approached in the same way with his same method, you know, and, and refined.

705
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,760
That method and learnt, learnt his lessons.

706
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,760
Um, and he had, he's the most tenacious person I've ever met.

707
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,760
Like, um, I, I call him the endurance athlete.

708
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,760
He can go for longer, harder for longer than anyone I've ever met.

709
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,760
He'll, he'll always wear down the problem before the problem wears him, wears him down.

710
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Um, and then like any good endurance athlete, once it's done, he'll just break down then.

711
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,760
But he's, um, he's got a, he's got a way.

712
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,760
He's got a, he's got a way of physically pushing himself and you don't often talk about that in business, but he's got a way of physically pushing himself more than anyone I've ever seen.

713
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:35,760
And it was, um, amazing to see that and see that level of commitment that it takes if you want to really extend yourself and, and, and really do growth quickly and aggressively.

714
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Like it's, it takes a lot.

715
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
It takes a lot.

716
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
And I saw that from him.

717
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,760
And then amongst all of that, and, and, and he's, he's in the trenches, right?

718
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Like he's doing it himself.

719
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,760
So he's lead by example and supports his team.

720
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:58,760
He allow, he will know from his experience that the pathway that I may have been taking, it would, would result in maybe not the optimal result, but he'd let me take that path.

721
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,760
So he allowed failure when he could see the outcome coming.

722
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,760
And that was, they were the best lessons for me, like expensive for him sometimes, which is mind blowing.

723
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,760
Like he could say like, this is going to cost me money and not work, but you go.

724
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
And like, uh, yeah.

725
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,760
And like, uh, I would learn from that.

726
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,760
The team would learn from that and we'd all be better for it.

727
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:25,760
And he, he can see the value in that other than just the potential short-term loss that it would apply to that.

728
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,760
I could go on.

729
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,760
It's just a, it's an encyclopedia of knowledge that you get out of him.

730
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,760
And, um, it's about integrity in, in, in dealings.

731
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Like if you say you're going to do something, you have to do something.

732
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,760
He, he can't sleep at night if he feels like he's been on the wrong side of the deal.

733
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,760
But if he's on the right side of the deal, he'll go hard.

734
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,760
And that's one thing you learn as well.

735
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Like if, you know, do your deal, honor your deals.

736
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,760
If someone does the wrong thing on the other side, then you owe it to yourself to make sure they honor the deal.

737
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:02,760
Um, lots of stuff that may as a timid kind of introverted type person wouldn't naturally want to do or feel like was the right thing to do.

738
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:10,760
But also saying that out of that, out of conflict and things that might seem like they're conflict, stronger relationships are built and good partnerships are built.

739
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,760
And opportunities to collaborate again in the future are built.

740
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:23,760
Whereas if things are unsaid, if they're not addressed, if people don't understand the dynamic that needs to exist for a relationship to work, then there's no future in that relationship.

741
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,760
I don't know.

742
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
That's a lot.

743
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
I could go on.

744
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,760
I could go on for an hour just talking about him and what I've learned and how grateful I am for it.

745
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
I'm fascinated, uh, Steve.

746
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
I'd love to, uh, to meet him at some stage.

747
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,760
And I, I love the passion you speak about and the lessons learned you've got, you can articulate them in such a powerful way.

748
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
And I, and it's, yeah.

749
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:53,760
It's, it's part of why I love this, this forum because you get to share and you want to do that because I know the evidence suggests, you know, a lot of people work in environments where a leader may be struggling, you know, through sometimes no fault of their own, just lack of education and understanding.

750
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
And that, you know, that lessens people's lives.

751
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,760
A lot of people will get stuck in environments because they don't see a way out.

752
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,760
They've just got to hand to mouth and, and they want to feed their, you know, their family and look after themselves.

753
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
But you want to share stories like that.

754
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
I do personally.

755
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
I want to, I want to tell them more widely.

756
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:15,760
And maybe you'd be generous enough to, to, to see if he'd be up for telling it because it sounds like something we should get out into different environments.

757
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
And I'm sure it's going to apply to a lot of different spaces.

758
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Is that, is that how you think about it?

759
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Oh, you'd have a great show with him.

760
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,760
He's, um, and you get to talk about horse racing with him as well.

761
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,760
So you still get the sports crossover.

762
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,760
He's a Melbourne Cup winner, isn't he?

763
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,760
Everything.

764
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,760
I mean, he's won a Melbourne Cup, a Caulfield Cup, a Cox Place and all within the last sort of eight or nine years.

765
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Like he's been prolific.

766
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,760
And, and, and again, he applies the same message.

767
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,760
He applies the same mentality to that.

768
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,760
He, you know, he's, he's got his network of people he trusts.

769
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:52,760
He's got his, his people that he goes into horses with and he, and creates like a really happy and fun environment, um, in those horses.

770
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,760
And it's the same thing.

771
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,760
It's the same way it applies to his business.

772
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
You know, like he's not, he's doing it because he wants to do it.

773
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
He's doing it because he loves it and it's a passion.

774
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,760
And he wants, he wants to do that with people that he enjoys working with, you know, trainers, agents, breeders, whatever.

775
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,760
You know?

776
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,760
He wants to work with that trusted network and then they all work for each other.

777
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,760
And, um, I believe that, you know, those relationships are the key to the success that he's had there.

778
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,760
A lot of people might point to luck, but that's not what I see when I look at Aussie.

779
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,760
I see anything but luck.

780
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,760
I see tenacity and planning and good relationships.

781
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
Not what it happens to consistently.

782
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
And, uh, yeah, I love it.

783
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,760
And it's a good way to live your life, isn't it?

784
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
With that sort of consistency and, uh, and passion.

785
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Final question to you, Steve.

786
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,760
If you could collaborate, uh, we're a bit obsessed with collaboration and the work we're doing.

787
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Have you collaborated with anyone on any of your passions?

788
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
And there are many of them.

789
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
I can hear them pour out of you.

790
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,760
Is there, is there a name that's, that's come to mind?

791
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,760
You thought that will be someone I'd love to collaborate with?

792
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Um, I've, I've had the luck to do it, I think.

793
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Like, I think collaborating with Aussie has been, I've been so lucky to do that.

794
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,760
Um, so I'll answer your question in a different way.

795
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,760
And my collaboration is, is how I can get people to work with me.

796
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,760
How I can get sport and movement and residential, sustainable residential housing together.

797
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,760
So, and there, there will be a huge collaboration that is required to make that work, but that's

798
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,760
the, the space that I really, I think is interesting.

799
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,760
I think it's a really interesting space to play in.

800
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,760
And, um, there's a huge opportunity for collaboration in that space.

801
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,760
So it's, um, it's about going on a journey, which I'm on now to, to find the people that,

802
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,760
that I'm going to go on that journey with.

803
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,760
And how we can execute upon, um, the opportunities that live in, in those sort of shared spaces.

804
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,760
So, uh, it's a bit of a different answer because I think I've been lucky with who I've collaborated

805
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,760
with and it's, um, set me up with an opportunity to create some future collaborations with

806
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,760
those, with those two areas crossing over.

807
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
You, you've got my curiosity.

808
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,760
I did say final question, but my curiosity is going.

809
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,760
I, I, can you give me a little bit more sport, uh, development?

810
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,760
So, you know, is it social housing?

811
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,760
What?

812
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Is it, uh, you know, a problem that needs to be solved for all of us, but, um, is there

813
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,760
some more clues you can give us as to how that might play out?

814
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,760
Oh, well, I, I believe in a value share model.

815
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,760
I believe that there's a particular part of the market that'll look at a value share model.

816
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,760
So that's being landowners in particular, some landowners that will say like, I will

817
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,760
stay in this project if I can see a share of this project do some good.

818
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
So that's, that's the sort of value share element.

819
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
And that, and so that could, you know, that could play out in social.

820
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Good back in the housing area or good back in the, yeah.

821
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
Yeah.

822
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,760
That could, that could, that could be social affordable housing, or that could be community

823
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,760
infrastructure.

824
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,760
That could be anything, right?

825
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
Anything that can have an impact.

826
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,760
Yeah.

827
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,760
And that might have been impacted a local, regional, national, international level, right?

828
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Like you can, you can, you can choose your course, but the hypothesis is if a project

829
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,760
goes well, the investment should get a fair return.

830
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Yeah.

831
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,760
If the market moves and a project goes well and you get a crazy super profit, maybe we

832
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,760
can reinvest some of that into, into community is the, is the underlying philosophy that

833
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,760
I, I.

834
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,760
I see.

835
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,760
And I believe there are other landowners and, and businesses that would, would have a similar

836
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
view.

837
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,760
And so it's that, it's that profit for purpose model applied to property.

838
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,760
And I'm just interested in, you know, I see, I see sports opportunities around the place

839
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,760
where, you know, where you can integrate sport and movement into, into housing and community

840
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,760
projects.

841
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,760
And yeah, that's something I find really interesting and want to explore wherever I can.

842
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
And what a brilliant project.

843
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,760
And given your mindset and your sense of purpose and your ability to execute a plan, I, I'm

844
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
fascinated, Steve.

845
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,760
I'd love to sit down in a, you know, another period of time and, and track that with great

846
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,760
interest.

847
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,760
And I love that you're applying your, your brilliant mind to it because both our love

848
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,760
of sport and we know what that does to, to, you know, and it's already there in community.

849
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,760
We know it's a big part of it, but I'm sure to integrate in a way that you're talking

850
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
about will be fascinating.

851
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,760
Steve, I've loved sitting down with you.

852
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,760
Always enjoy, as I said from the start.

853
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,760
Anytime to catch up with you always makes me smile.

854
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,760
Congratulations on everything that you're doing.

855
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,760
And I really appreciate you sharing some of your wisdom today.

856
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,760
Thanks very much.

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,760
