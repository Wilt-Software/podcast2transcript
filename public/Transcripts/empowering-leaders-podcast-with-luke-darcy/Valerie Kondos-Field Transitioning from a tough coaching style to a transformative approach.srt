1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:11,300
Valerie Condos-Field was awarded the Pac-12 US College Coach of the Century despite nearly

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,739
quitting two years into her career. She shares the great story of how she transformed her approach

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,100
completely. They asked me for a team meeting and I was like oh I love team meetings yeah let's

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,379
let's talk. One by one they went around the room and they gave me examples that were absolutely

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:35,500
true of how my coaching style was hurtful and demeaning. It made them feel less less than but

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:43,299
I remember sitting there and just willing myself my brain to be still so I could really hear them.

7
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,200
Intriguing to hear how one of the most successful coaches in US college history

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,320
explained that the focus was never on winning. Her coaching mantra became to develop champions

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,359
in life through sport. You are helping this person continue to make

10
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:05,120
these micro moment changes and decision and choices in their lives which are helping them

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,540
transform into a greater version of themselves. You'll also hear Valerie Condos-Field talk about

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,480
the legendary Simone Biles a once in a lifetime athlete. She was gifted and born with the perfect

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,200
physique and physiological attributes to do the sport of gymnastics. She will go down as the goat

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,959
before this last Olympic but she did

15
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,760
because she could and she wanted to experience it with a different mindset. It's people like

16

26
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,969
meet you today thanks for joining me. Thank you Luke so much.

27
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,610
I appreciate it. It's an extraordinary life that you've lived and when you listen to

28
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,569
some of those achievements back that I just read out what are you proud of most? All of it honestly

29
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:47,030
it never ceases to amaze me how it all like how did it all happen and I know how it happened

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,729
because I speak about it all the time but when I think about I had my entire adult career in the

31
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:58,889
world of athletics and I did not grow up in the world of athletics and then I was able to achieve

32
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,509
sustained success for three decades. I literally sometimes just shake my hand and go how did that

33
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,430
happen but then because I speak about it and I teach you about it so much I know how it happened.

34
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,810
Can we go back to the first few years as coach and you describe yourself as tough and testy and at

35
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,930
times maybe even nasty. You were close to giving it all away. Can you tell us about that time?

36
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,610
I was asked to be the head coach in the late 80s and this was the time when

37
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,069
in my mind a leader a strong leader had all the answers didn't have to ask anybody for their

38
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,770
opinion it was black and white and as a coach if you don't like it go find another team

39
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:50,150
and I felt that if I showed any signs of weakness meaning humility vulnerability

40
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:59,349
even an apology as to what I didn't know that I wouldn't have the command that I needed as a head

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:07,990
and so I literally just acted like what I thought a head coach should be and thankfully we did

42
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,789
absolutely horribly as a team. And Valerie that was the generation really I grew up playing

43
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:19,689
professional sport in that era where your coaches did crazy things they said crazy things to you

44
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:25,170
and if you couldn't cope bad luck someone else can and there was no other way really and so I

45
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,970
think that's what's remarkable about your story is that you did completely change paradise.

46
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,930
find a way and it took a number of your students and your athletes to come to you and sit you down

47
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,589
and say we don't like our sport under you as coach that's pretty confronting day can you tell us about

48
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:46,490
how that unfolded? Yeah I remember that so clearly they asked me for a team meeting and I was like

49
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:53,829
oh I love team meetings yeah let's let's talk and one by one they went around the room and they gave

50
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,910
me examples that were absolutely true of how my coaching style was hurtful

51
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,370
and demeaning and it made them feel less less than it didn't support them and they would say

52
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:16,389
to me I mean this was like 1991 maybe 92 but I I remember it so clearly because

53
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:23,689
oh I'm just tapping into something right now I talk about quite often the importance as a leader

54
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:29,709
to hone your listening skill and I think one reason why I remember it so clearly

55
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,449
is because I remember sitting in that room and willing myself to be still

56
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:45,709
and to really stop the the dialogue in my brain of all of my excuses as to why I did this and

57
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:51,430
I never said it like that and but you did that which is why I had to say that but I remember

58
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:59,970
sitting there and just willing myself my brain to be still so I could really hear them thank you for

59
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:07,589
this I just haven't thought about that before it was very very clear to me okay what do I want

60
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:14,490
them to feel less than do I want to be pushing them down these young vibrant talented smart

61
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:23,170
women no so either figure it out figure out a different way or quit and let somebody else do it

62
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:29,610
and then it takes incredible skill and will to change paradigm and a lot of people have that

63
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,790
and think you know I should do this a better way but then under pressure we go back to

64
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,310
our old habits and I suppose that is the intersection of your incredible friendship

65
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,610
as it turned out with the legendary coach John Wooden and for the audience that don't know about

66
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,089
coach Wooden won 10 national basketball championships in 12 seasons

67
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,569
seven in a row no other team had won more than four in a row or never has

68
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:58,889
before or since he won an incredible 88 consecutive games as as coach but he became an incredible

69
00:06:58,889 --> 00:06:59,949
mentor for you can you tell me what you think about that and what do you think about that

70
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,370
tell everyone about how that came about well it came about because I was I had not met coach

71
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,810
Wooden yet and I was on my way to resign and I was walking through our student union and walking

72
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,389
through the bookstore I happened upon a book of coach Wooden his leadership book and I just

73
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:26,089
literally opened it up like this and it opened up to his definition of success and I thought well

74
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:29,949
you know what he won 10 national championships he was hailed as the greatest

75
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,589
coach of any sport that ever lived what does he say about winning and I read success is peace of

76
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,149
mind and knowing that you've done your best and I kept flipping through the pages because I was like

77
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:48,310
this made no sense to me this is like a Hallmark card success is peace of mind and knowing you've

78
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,629
done your best oh that's nice and I thought where is he going to talk about winning coaches are

79
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,449
hired to win we're not hired to be mentors or

80
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:09,089
second moms or dads or your pal we're hired to win so he must talk about winning and I kept going

81
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:14,670
through the pages and like I kept coming back to his definition of success and when I read it

82
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:23,329
enough times and read it slowly success is peace of mind and knowing you have done your best I've

83
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:29,850
had the biggest aha moment of my professional career I had not been trying to be my

84
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:29,949
best coach I had not been trying to be my best coach I had not been trying to be my best coach

85
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,889
I had been trying to be somebody else and I started connecting all the proverbial dots

86
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:43,090
whenever you try to be somebody else you will always be a second right them I will never be

87
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,090
as good as somebody being them as they are being them and what I learned later on in my years when

88
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,350
I tried to be coach wooden that was equally as bad because I was never going to be as good as

89
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,629
coach wouldn't being coach wouldn't and the worst part that happens is when you try to be somebody

90
00:08:58,629 --> 00:08:59,850
else or even like somebody else you're not going to be as good as somebody else you're not going to

91
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:06,649
like somebody else it prevents you from truly developing into a first-rate you and so I didn't

92
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:12,990
resign I went back to my office and I thought what do I bring to the table as a head coach

93
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:21,769
of a UCLA gymnastics team and our sport is called artistic gymnastics

94
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:27,370
I grew up in the world of ballet there was a lot of

95
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,730
points that I didn't know I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to do it

96
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:29,830
I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to do it

97
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,230
given to artistry in our sport what do I bring well you know what I can teach the artistry and

98
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,769
movement quality and choreograph better than anybody else that's coaching gymnastics in this

99
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:49,289
country I'm going to do that so that was the technical for me and then I had to start thinking

100
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:57,429
about though the bigger picture was I just really did not buy into this world of athletics where

101
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,330
it was all about winning

102
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:06,409
because it seemed really silly to me that athletics was all about being able to say haha

103
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:12,750
we beat you haha I beat you today haha my team's better than your team it's like how many gazillions

104
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,950
of dollars are spent every year in athletics there has to be more to athletics than haha we

105
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:25,710
beat you so what is that and then it became really clear once I got the noise out of haha we beat you

106
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,730
and winning winning winning then I understood

107
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:37,049
understood, athletics is a master class in teaching really, really, really tough life

108
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:42,710
lessons you don't learn in a classroom. Athletics teaches us about resilience and perseverance and

109
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,789
how to fall and get back up. Athletics teaches us about being a part of a team, something greater

110
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:52,710
than yourself. Athletics teaches you all those things you do not learn in math and English and

111
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:59,450
history and science. And I was like, oh my gosh, I could do this. I'm going to help my student

112
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:09,009
athletes become champions in life through sport. And my classroom is the gym. And I went, I remember

113
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,529
going to my athletic director and I remember saying, okay, I got this, but I'm not focusing

114
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,850
on winning. I'm going to focus on developing every single one of my student athletes into the best

115
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,470
superhuman superhero they can be. And because I was at UCLA and because I could recruit talent,

116
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,429
I knew that that would

117
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:33,990
translate to the competition floor. And then guess what? It did. And we started winning.

118
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,570
It's such a brilliant, clear mission, isn't it? Create champions in life through sport.

119
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,389
It makes perfect sense when you say it. And then the success flowed from there. And I encourage

120
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,110
everyone, if you haven't listened to Valerie's TED Talk, go and do it. It's brilliant. And the

121
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,830
title is Why Winning Doesn't Always Equal Success. You gave a really great answer of that. Can you

122
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,409
maybe lean on that a little bit more of why winning doesn't always equal success?

123
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,870
There is much more to it than just reading out the highlights at the end,

124
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,269
the seven-time national champion. Can you tell us why there's more meaning behind it?

125
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:15,269
Because winning is finite. Winning is one moment. Winning is a ring. Winning is a trophy. Winning is

126
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:22,309
that moment in time. But it's everything that you develop to be able to achieve that success

127
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:29,090
that lasts beyond the win. And so when you truly are thinking,

128
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:37,289
of your adventure in becoming the best athlete that you can be, you're developing all of those

129
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:44,690
traits and characteristics that I just listed for you. And when you stop playing, you still carry

130
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,929
those into everything you do in life, into your family, into your next job, into whatever you want

131
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:55,330
to do. Those characteristics don't leave you just because you're no longer an athlete or a coach.

132
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,309
It was really fun for me to keep,

133
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:05,950
connecting these dots and realizing that if I'm going to choose to coach this way,

134
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:13,629
to teach gymnastics and coach and motivate this way, I had to walk my tongue. Because you can't

135
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:20,250
help someone develop into a better version of themselves by dictating orders. You have to figure

136
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:27,730
out how to motivate them to want to get that 1% better each day, to want to see the goal. Even if

137
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,830
we've won a national championship,

138
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:34,990
how can we do it better? Tomorrow, not waiting for the next national championship, but tomorrow.

139
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:42,210
And when you do that, you start instilling all of those traits and strengths into yourself and

140
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,009
you become a champion in life yourself. I love you use the word dictate there and

141
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,129
a line of yours that I really love. You can dictate your way to a win or a championship,

142
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:56,870
but you can't dictate your way to success. Can you break that down for us more? Because

143
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,549
it really rings true. Yeah.

144
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:04,490
I'm sure that you and your listeners have heard the buzzwords nowadays, transactional versus

145
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:13,870
transformational leadership. And a transactional leader, parent, coach, teacher, someone who is,

146
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,929
has influence, a leader is simply someone who has influence over another human being.

147
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:24,629
And a transactional leader is, if you do this, the transaction will be, then you'll get that.

148
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,269
If you hit the home run, then you're going to get the pound back. If you strike out,

149
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:35,470
you will maybe ignored when you get in the dugout. That is transactional. And it's,

150
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:44,009
and it's very evident with a lot of parenting as well. That is dictating. That is authoritative

151
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:51,970
dictatorship. You are holding the power over this person. And they often, as we know this in sport,

152
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:59,129
too many times, the athlete is focusing on pleasing the coach instead of figuring out,

153
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:03,570
how to get better mentally, emotionally, and physically. And the converse of that,

154
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,230
as we say, is transformational leadership. And it's exactly what it sounds like.

155
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:14,529
Like you think of a transformer and as a coach, you are helping this person continue

156
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:21,110
to make these micro moment changes and decision and choices in their lives,

157
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,029
which are helping them transform into a greater version of themselves. In fact,

158
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,990
later on in my career,

159
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,769
someone would ask me, I remember being on airplanes and people would say, Oh,

160
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,870
what do you do for a living? Or do you work or whatever? And I'd say, yeah, I, I develop

161
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,909
superheroes and they would say, Oh, you work in Hollywood. And I go, no, I work near Hollywood,

162
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:50,529
but I help young women transform into these superheroes. Cause when you think about a

163
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:58,309
superhero, superhero, isn't jumping over buildings for bribing rights. That man's not

164
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,330
jumping over buildings and say,

165
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,809
aha, Superman, I beat you. They're doing it to help the world be a better place. And that was my

166
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:13,809
goal with our student athletes. So the challenge was how to motivate them to want to make different

167
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:18,370
choices in their lives. Valerie, one of my favorite sayings is success without fulfillment

168
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,590
is the ultimate failure. And do you subscribe to this winning coaches of one championships? And

169
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,350
you know, we see that in our part of the world in Australia, but what's left is broken relationships.

170
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:35,470
And dysfunction at the end, would you say even with the premierships and the championships that

171
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,809
doesn't equal success? A hundred percent. And that is, that is the underlying theme through my entire

172
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:48,009
TED talk. When you think about sport, when you think about business, so many of us around the

173
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:57,230
world, we have embraced this win at all costs culture. And when you do that, you can win.

174
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,389
You can make a lot of money.

175
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:07,029
But when you embrace that win at all costs culture philosophy, there are casualties. And the

176
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:15,049
casualty isn't a loss. The casualty isn't loss of money. The casualty are humans, mentally,

177
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:22,630
emotionally, and sometimes physically. That's a daunting responsibility to accept. But if you

178
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,369
don't accept it, you're burying your head in the sand. And all you're focusing on is your ego and

179
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:34,309
the end result. To be able to say, ha ha, I won. Ha ha, I beat you. Ha ha, my company made more

180
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:35,170
money than your company.

181
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,450
Valerie, we, um, we talk about parenting a lot in these conversations. You mentioned it. I see a

182
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,849
generation of parents now obsessed with their kids winning. What advice would you give to them?

183
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,950
A lot. Whenever I'm asked to speak with young adults, you know, gymnasts and all that, I said,

184
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:00,210
I'll do it all on condition parents are there. Because if we're just talking to the child about

185
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:06,609
not focusing on winning, but you're going home and the parents are just in your ear constantly,

186
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,349
and all they're doing is focusing on winning, the child doesn't have a chance. Um, I'm sure

187
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:19,710
you've heard this statistic that 95% of children decide to leave their sport on the car ride home

188
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,450
because they're enclosed in this little metal box.

189
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:30,069
And they can't get away from the questions. And one of my most favorite people to listen to on

190
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:34,569
podcasts and her books is, um, her name is Dr. Shefali.

191
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,609
Yeah, I did a podcast with Dr. Shefali, uh, Ms. Fowle. And, um, I encourage people to go back

192
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:45,289
at the conscious parenting expert and, and, and her language in this is brilliant, isn't it?

193
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,849
Is why overlay on your kids, something you didn't achieve yourself and trying to live

194
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:53,710
that vicariously through your own kids and the damage that's done.

195
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,630
And you mentioned the conversation in the car. I'm obsessed with that, isn't it? That opportunity

196
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,109
to literally, you know, destroy your kids, love the sport on the way home by comparing them

197
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:08,569
to someone else. Why didn't you play more like Simone Biles? Why didn't you achieve more? Or

198
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:13,690
the answer is we just love watching you play. We just love being there for you effectively. And

199
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,269
it's a, it's a great conversation. It's through all your leadership is that that's probably feels

200
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:23,309
like that's been the cornerstone of it. Yes. When I gave my TED talk in part of my TED talk,

201
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,230
as a parent, you'll know if you're focusing on the end result, or if you're really, truly focusing

202
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,509
on helping your child become the best version of themselves by the questions you ask them.

203
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:40,869
And I said, if you're asking questions about the end result, like, did you get an A? How many points

204
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,630
did you score? Did you win? You, you'll know you're really not truly interested in helping

205
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,190
them become the best version of themselves. And after my TED talk, I had a woman come up to me

206
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,109
and she said, Ms. Fowle.

207
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,450
I have to tell you, I am a stereotypical tiger mom. I was like, okay, well, your words, not my

208
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,150
words. Okay. And she said, when you were sending this, do you ask your kids about their grades?

209
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,890
And if they won, I was nodding my head because I was so proud of myself. And then I realized

210
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,650
that's not what I should be asking my kids. I said, you know what? Good for you. Good for you

211
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,529
for listening and processing. And she says, I'm going to ask my children different questions from

212
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,509
now on. I said, great. Good for you.

213
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,829
It's a profound thing is a real passion of mine with our four kids. And you're watching

214
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:33,170
just the obsessive nature of junior sport and the kids always get it right. The kids

215
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:39,450
totally understand their fair. They like to win, but at the end they move on really quickly. It's

216
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,950
their parents that hang on to, to, to this. And, and, you know, as you said, the statistics are

217
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:52,390
95% of kids lose their love of sport because of the conversation in the car with their parents. So

218
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:00,950
Simone Biles has transcended your sport in a way that is hard to imagine. I know you've got a

219
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,130
incredibly close relationship. You've produced and choreographed her tour. I believe coming up,

220
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,089
can you tell us a bit about her and, and yeah, that once in a lifetime type of athlete that

221
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:19,329
comes along? She is the once in a lifetime type of athlete. And part of it is she was gifted and

222
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:23,829
born with the perfect physique and physiological.

223
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:31,109
Attributes to do the sport of gymnastics. Not just physically, muscularly, but mentally as well

224
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,190
to be able to calculate two flips and three twists and know where she is in the air and all of that.

225
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:42,509
What I love, first of all, I recruited Simone to UCLA and she actually signed a national letter

226
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,390
of intent with us. And then she went pro. And so she said something in these last Olympics

227
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,130
that had NIL been around, she would have competed at UCLA for me. And I was like,

228
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,930
dang her to my heart.

229
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,630
Seven national champs would have become 10 national championships. Winning, winning, winning,

230
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:07,009
right? But what I love about her journey, and I love sharing with people, is she's not just a

231
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:17,029
one-hit wonder. It's not like she just won the all-around title in 2016 or 2021. She went through,

232
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:22,769
as we all know, a full mental shift with what we call in our sport twisties.

233
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:31,750
She has been really doing a deep dive with her therapist. They use to retrain your brain.

234
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,609
And when we first started rehearsals for the Golden America Tour and we were on a break,

235
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,450
I said, Simone, I am fascinated by this. Because you light up when you talk about

236
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,390
your therapist and counseling. And what is it that really has resonated with you?

237
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,930
Because you are different than you were four years ago. And she said, you know, Ms. Fowle,

238
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,890
she says, it's not just going through the gymnastic skills with this. She says,

239
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,450
but there is the process of just uncovering the layers of the trauma. And one layer after another,

240
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:11,309
after another. And she says, it sounds like it would have been frightening, but it wasn't.

241
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:18,970
It released me of all this pent-up tension that I've had for so many years. And for her to be

242
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,890
able to share that with the world, she didn't have to do another Olympic Games. She,

243
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,029
who is already the best in the world, she will go down as the GOAT before this last Olympics.

244
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,730
But she did because, A, she could, and she wanted to experience it with a different mindset.

245
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:41,130
Amazing story, isn't it? And as you said, an athlete that has taken your sport to levels

246
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,549
very few thought was probably possible. And it would be hard to match that again.

247
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,529
I love these conversations with people with unique backgrounds like yours. And we see

248
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,690
these patterns of what makes great leaders. And yours is an incredible leadership story.

249
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,730
Starting with self-leadership, I want to ask the question, what is one way that you fill up your

250
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,990
own cup so that you can be the person you want to be? That's a really great question.

251
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:13,049
I retired when I was 60. And so I think what a lot of us experience, if we thankfully live this long,

252
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,710
is you have a career. I had a career that was very structured. And so I didn't really have

253
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,930
to think about and plan my day, really. It was planned for me. And then I retired,

254
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,089
and even though I do a lot of speaking and a lot of teaching and a lot of this,

255
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,970
it's not structured. And I noticed the first few years that I was retired, it wasn't just

256
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,269
that I didn't have this identity anymore as the head coach of UCLA Gymnastics,

257
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:47,910
but I didn't have a structure. And so I was sleeping in late. I wasn't getting things done

258
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,589
during the day. And I was procrastinating. And I literally would just kind of walk by my bed and go,

259
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,750
I'm just going to lay down for a little bit. And I was in this lull, like this sadness and

260
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:07,970
state of depression, it felt like. And I just told, I coached myself up. And I was like, okay,

261
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,230
walk your talk here. What would you say to someone that told you this? And I'd say,

262
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:17,490
well, the first thing I would say is the night before, figure out your schedule for tomorrow.

263
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:23,869
The second thing I would tell myself is before you get out of bed, I want you to enumerate,

264
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,930
three things that you're really grateful for, to get yourself motivated for the day.

265
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:36,650
And then don't wait to be motivated, but just be disciplined to follow your schedule.

266
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:43,430
And part of that schedule is allotting time in that schedule for stillness.

267
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:50,230
Because a lot of what I'm doing is creatively, choreographing, writing another book,

268
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,450
speaking engagements. When I do a speaking engagement,

269
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:53,930
I will tell myself, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And I'm going to do that.

270
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:00,710
To the company whom I'm speaking for. And that takes stillness. And that's something that I think

271
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:07,329
that we're really lacking in our society now. And it's something that we have to be extremely

272
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:14,730
intentional with to get in our days. I love speaking with 20 something year olds. And when

273
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:22,710
I ask them, how many of you scroll through social media through the day? They go, all the hands go

274
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,710
up. I go, how many of you?

275
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:29,869
And probably too much time scrolling through social. All their hands go up. How many of you

276
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:37,410
are scrolling through social media to numb out? Their hands go up. And then I start asking,

277
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:43,630
what are you needing to numb out from? The stresses of their days. Stresses of school,

278
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:48,609
stresses of friendships, stresses of social media, stresses of sport, stress, stress,

279
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:53,670
stress. I said, you have all this stress in your brain that you need to numb out,

280
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,910
from. And by scrolling through social media, you're putting more stuff in your brain.

281
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:08,490
That makes sense. And they just kind of look at me like, oh, yeah. I said, so hold up your phone.

282
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,490
Just hold your phone up. And they all hold up their phone. I said, okay, open your hand. And

283
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,269
they're like, I'm not opening my hand. My phone will drop. I'm like, exactly. Your phone is not

284
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,190
attached to you. You're attached to your phone. It's a choice.

285
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,269
And I think the, the, uh,

286
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,990
stillness that you described there, the pattern I think of the people I speak to the most is they

287
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,450
have some sort of practice in that space. You called it stillness and others, mindfulness or

288
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:39,490
meditation. But most people who, who work it out have got some part of that. And as you said,

289
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:43,269
particularly with the distraction of having that in our hand attached to us all the time,

290
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,809
that seems more and more relevant than ever. What is one thing that's always worked for you

291
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,529
as a leader that you would never change? Love. Uh,

292
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:01,490
want to just have a really strong conversation with someone and just say, what the hell do you

293
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:08,130
think you're doing? Thankfully, I have grown to the point where I don't allow myself, myself to

294
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:16,589
speak from a place of emotion and I will back off and I will think about the situation from a place

295
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:23,869
of love and empathy and compassion. And that, how can I help?

296
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:32,309
This person. And through that point of love, understanding that quite often it, what's

297
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:39,390
happening on the surface, isn't the issue. It's what's happening below the surface. And we don't

298
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,009
know someone else's story. We don't know their trauma. We don't know their triggers. We don't

299
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:51,250
know their history, but in any moment of the day, those things can be triggered. And for me to,

300
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,910
to suppose that I know,

301
00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:00,049
know what someone else is going through is very arrogant. And so I, I don't do that. I'm very proud

302
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:05,710
that I don't do that. And I can call myself down to a place of coming from a place of love. And

303
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,990
you know, there's the, the, the term of tough love. I don't like the term tough, but I just

304
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:18,730
feel like, like honesty to be able to, to ask permission of someone and just say, I want to

305
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,690
have a hard conversation with you. And I'm asking your permission to be a hundred percent honest.

306
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:30,769
With you. And once you have that agreement, that's when the magic happens. That's when you

307
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,609
really start getting to the heart of the problem. Um, when I was asking some of our student athletes

308
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:42,190
about like the last few years of my career at UCLA, and what are the things that they really

309
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:51,410
remember about our culture that was developed at UCLA gymnastics, they all will say the one thing

310
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,910
that they practiced and learned. And that's when you really start getting to the heart of the problem.

311
00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:02,769
And I would tell them, I said, you know, if you're not being a hundred percent honest with someone,

312
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:06,569
you're not being respectful because basically what you're saying is you're not strong enough

313
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:13,829
to handle the truth and to ask permission, to be that honest. And sometimes I would have an

314
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:19,549
athlete saying, Ms. Fell, not today. I just, I can't handle it today. And I'd say, totally

315
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,890
understand. Come by my office or let's go to coffee when, when you do want to talk about this.

316
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:29,250
Yeah. Beautiful answer. Um, we, we see people that have success, like you've had, uh, sustained

317
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,150
success over decades of a, of a really clear vision. I want to ask you a question. Has there

318
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,529
been a visionary leader in your life that, uh, you felt compelled to follow their, their vision?

319
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:46,150
Yes. Coach Wooden and my husband, Bobby Field was our defensive coordinator for football at UCLA.

320
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:52,470
And he's very, very, very much like John Wooden. When we first started dating,

321
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,910
so coach,

322
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,970
Wooden, my husband, they're kind of like this. Okay. They don't drink. They don't swear. They

323
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,710
don't get really hyper emotional a little bit. And when I first started dating Bobby,

324
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:14,369
he gave me a little flip a paper that said, be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger.

325
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:22,650
It's just like on our second date. I was like, wow. Okay. Um, but as I said earlier,

326
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:30,509
part of what I did that wasn't good is I felt that I couldn't, I wasn't going to be a good person

327
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:38,190
if I didn't act like my husband did. And I talked to him about this at one point and he said, no,

328
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:44,289
no, no, no, no, no. You be you. I'm going to be me. You be you. And you're fiery and you're feisty

329
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:51,529
and you're all of that. It's just, you get yourself in trouble. Me, I get myself in trouble when I

330
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:52,450
cross the line.

331
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,250
To making it personal with someone. And so I looked back on my coaching career

332
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:05,789
and I can be honest and forthcoming and fiery and feisty and in your face, as long as it is

333
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:11,630
instructional. When it crosses the line to being personal, that's when it was not.

334
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,849
A college romance that, uh, that turned into a lifelong marriage. A great story. That's a

335
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:21,930
brave thing on a second date to say, be quick to listen, slow to speak. He's a,

336
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,670
he's a braver man than most. And for that to have landed well, that's a, that's a great story. I

337
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:32,509
love, um, thanks for sharing that. Curiosity is a word that we hear all the time in successful

338
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:38,349
leaders. How do you carve out time to be curious and how do you go about integrating that into

339
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:42,490
your life and your, your journey? Oh gosh, almost every moment of the day.

340
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:48,089
And I think that was part of my success when I decided to change my coaching style,

341
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:51,910
which was about, I don't know, two years into my being a head coach.

342
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:59,109
I had to ask a hundred questions a day because I knew nothing about gymnastics.

343
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:06,390
And so what we learned and what I've learned since is that one of the best ways to teach someone

344
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:14,089
is to give them a little bit of instruction and then let them quote unquote fail and just ask

345
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:18,589
them questions. How are you feeling? What were you thinking before? What, what do you think you

346
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:21,910
should do differently this next time? And I remember a student athlete,

347
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,450
you know, on balance fame and they'd fall and they'd come up to me. They'd say,

348
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:28,430
Ms. Val, what'd I do wrong? I'm like, I have no idea. Let's figure this out.

349
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,589
What were you thinking before? Let's watch the video. And I would learn along the way.

350
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:42,269
I think it was just enforced because I said I knew nothing. I am also an extremely curious person.

351
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:49,809
I want to read every single leadership book on the planet before I die. I love asking questions.

352
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,089
I have no problem.

353
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,950
I subscribe to the fact that there's no dumb or ignorant question. And so I have no problem

354
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,670
humbling myself to say, I have no clue what to do, or I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:11,110
And it, as a coach, think about this. You know that you're going to have a successful season

356
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,889
when the team takes ownership of the team. Well, the best way to do that is to ask them

357
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,909
a hundred questions about their team culture, their team philosophy,

358
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,230
about team accountability, about team agreements. What are those going to look and sound like and

359
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,969
feel like? And get them in it instead of dictating them what the rules and the guidelines are going

360
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:41,489
to be. So back when I was coaching, the first day that everybody met, we would go over the

361
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:47,150
student athlete handbook, which were the rules and the guidelines. And if I were coaching today,

362
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:51,150
I would not use the word rules. I would really use

363
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:58,110
guidelines and agreements or standards, guidelines and agreements so that it is an

364
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,369
agreement and not a rule. Makes perfect sense. Has there been

365
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:08,909
an example of great collaboration in your life? Yeah. I love to collaborate. I love to collaborate

366
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:16,190
in everything I do. When I was coaching, I was very, very lucky to have an athletic department,

367
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,349
an athletic director that allowed me to go choreograph for a Sea World San Diego every year.

368
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:26,110
So the month of May, I would go down to San Diego and I choreographed their summer shows

369
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:32,769
that were like Cirque du Soleil type of shows. And early on, I didn't have to learn this. This

370
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:38,909
is just kind of like what I knew. I would be choreographing and the facility guys would be

371
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:44,510
walking behind me. And I'd say, hold on, come here. Okay, you guys, performers, do the first

372
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,969
thing I taught you. Okay. Then do the next thing that I just changed. Which do you like better?

373
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:58,170
And it sounds like a weird collaboration, but it was clear to me that I needed to craft something

374
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,269
that was going to be appealing, not to somebody who had two decades of dance experience behind

375
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:09,969
him, but to the common folk. And so I collaborate with everyone and I love to collaborate and I

376
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:15,809
hate, hate to craft things by myself. Yeah. Brilliant answer. And I love

377
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:20,329
hearing that story. Communication is probably the thing we most commonly hear from people,

378
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:25,190
that they're really understanding of how important that is in any leadership environment.

379
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,190
Have you had a mantra when it comes to how you've communicated in your roles?

380
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:37,789
Yeah. The most important communication skill to hone is listening. And I had a sports psychologist

381
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:43,750
at UCLA who, when we were talking about this, put the word listen up on the board. And then

382
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,929
he said, the secret to being a good listener is, the secret is in this word, just rearrange the

383
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:57,050
letters. And so when you rearrange the letters, it's spelled listen, it spells silent. And whenever

384
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:04,849
I share that with people, they go, oh, wow. But to truly listen, I think it's one of the greatest

385
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:10,090
gifts that we can give another human being. But when most of us are listening, pretending like

386
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,949
we're listening, we're thinking about what we're going to say next. And I don't think, I know,

387
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:19,389
it takes practice. Once again, the word stillness,

388
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:29,210
to get still so that you're able to truly listen with all of your senses, not just audibly. But

389
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,969
how are they saying it? What do they look like? What are their mannerisms? What's the energy

390
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:40,090
they're giving off? That's how you truly listen. And that is the most important communication skill

391
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,670
to have. Because if you're not listening, then it's just a one-way dialogue. Then you're just

392
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,269
waiting for that person to shut up so you can keep talking. It's a great description.

393
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:53,369
I love the detail you went into there. Because you can truly tell when someone's listening,

394
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,989
can't you? You know it instinctively. You can almost feel their brain ticking over,

395
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,610
waiting to interrupt you or someone. And even sitting across from you, you can just see you're

396
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,969
an intent listener. You just have got that practice. And I suppose it is a practice.

397
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,550
Valerie, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

398
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:19,110
My mother. My mother. Yeah. She was extremely compassionate. And I love,

399
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:25,809
I love the understanding, the difference between empathy and compassion. And empathy is when you

400
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:31,789
feel something with someone, but compassion is when you put an action to it. And so my mother

401
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:38,670
was extremely empathetic to everyone she met, but there was always an action for it that was very

402
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:44,030
compassionate. Yeah. Beautiful to hear. And I love it when someone has a family member or a parent

403
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,989
in their life and that immediately comes to mind. We're a bit obsessed with collaboration and

404
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:49,269
bringing,

405
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:54,429
great leaders together around the globe in what we do in our space and different thinking.

406
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,309
Has there been someone, and you've been able to collaborate with the legendary Coach Wooden and

407
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:05,010
your husband and Bobby and what he did, but have you thought, you know, Simone Biles in your recent

408
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,869
collaboration, but has there been someone you thought, God, I'd love to connect or collaborate

409
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:15,050
with them in any one of the passions in your life? Absolutely. I love the psychologist,

410
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,309
Michael Gervais. He's got a podcast and I bring,

411
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:26,110
I'm in and speak to my class all the time. I love collaborating with the director that

412
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:33,789
wrote and directed the Gold Over America tour. His name is Mark Swanhart. He goes by Swanee,

413
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:41,010
but he just has a different gift than I have. But to be able to bring his vision to life

414
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:48,489
through movement choreographically for this tour, I love collaborating with, when I first got the job

415
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,190
as the head coach, I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach.

416
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,369
I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach.

417
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:49,789
I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach. I was a coach.

418
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:54,389
I called the other three head coaches around the country that had won national championships

419
00:39:54,389 --> 00:40:02,530
and who were consistently putting 10,000 people in their arenas. And that was Suzanne Yoffin at

420
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,170
University of Georgia, Sarah Patterson at Alabama, and Greg Marston at the University of Utah.

421
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:15,329
And I just pick their brains constantly. I would love to collaborate with Brené Brown.

422
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,989
I would love to collaborate with Jay Shetty.

423
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:26,050
I would love to collect a lot you just name them I'm there I love I love hearing that and that's

424
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:31,849
fascinating so you direct competitors the people that you were going to compete against you rang

425
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:39,349
and asked how to create the success and they're open to sharing 100% all three of them literally

426
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:45,670
they opened their playbook to me it was truly truly remarkable and I do the same now there's

427
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,429
about five or six head coaches around the country that I'm mentoring and they you know I don't share

428
00:40:52,429 --> 00:41:00,369
each other's secrets but it's like yes and and that's why it's so funny I just had a friend today

429
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:08,050
tell me are you gonna slow down I was like no no I'm not I will die then I'll slow down but I've

430
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:14,150
had so much fun at what I've done and I've made so many mistakes and I've learned so much through it

431
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,650
and I'm a consistent

432
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:23,590
learner and student of life and of leadership and all that I want to help as as those people

433
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:29,590
help me my learning curve be shorter I want to help somebody else's learning curve be shorter

434
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:38,789
if I can and the collaborative part of humanity is I mean that's just what we all should be doing

435
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:44,730
and you look back at what you achieve developing champions in life through sport is as good a

436
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,650
mission as you can and

437
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,289
And I love the definition of success, redefining what success means.

438
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:50,710
The trophies are there.

439
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:51,829
The championships are there.

440
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,590
But the impact on people's lives is such a great story to hear.

441
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,630
And I'm sure many people will be empowered by what you've been able to share today.

442
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:00,389
So thanks, Valerie.

443
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:01,429
I really appreciate you joining me.

444
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,010
Thank you.

445
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,730
And, you know, Luke, yes, I have a lot of trinkets.

446
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:06,510
I have rings.

447
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,630
I'm in the Hall of Fame.

448
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,429
But that's because I worked at UCLA.

449
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,510
That's because Coach Wooden always used to say, you can't win without talent.

450
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,389
And so I was able to attract and recruit talent.

451
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:30,250
But there are thousands of coaches that are just as fabulous and impactful and successful as I have been that don't have one ring.

452
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:38,690
But that doesn't mean that they haven't been successful in helping young people develop into champions in life.

453
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,630
And you don't need the ring to substantiate that.

454
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,610
All you need, truly, is an athlete, a student.

455
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,530
And at some point, you'll be able to say thank you.

456
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,269
Great note to finish on.

457
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:51,309
It's been a great privilege to spend some time with you.

458
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:51,710
Thanks, Valerie.

459
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:52,489
Appreciate it.

460
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,289
Thank you, Luke, so much.

461
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:54,929
I appreciate it.

00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:58,170
