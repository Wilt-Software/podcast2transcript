I'm sure you're going to love this story.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,890
Vanessa Ford is an extraordinary individual in every possible way.

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:15,910
She in many ways to me is the real life version of the animated superhero she created, Super

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,469
Sema, an African superhero whose superpowers of science and technology and using her brilliant

5
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:28,429
mind are inspiring millions of young black boys and girls around the globe who for generations

6
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,870
have grown up not seeing someone who looks like them on TV.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:39,030
Vanessa explains how important it has been for her embracing, in her own words, her incredible

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,649
big Afro hair and the story behind what that means for so many African women.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,090
You'll also hear her talk about the support of Serena and Venus Williams and Oprah Winfrey

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,810
behind the scenes and investing in the world in which she operates.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,090
The experience of being a young woman of colour working in the entertainment industry directly

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,130
for Harvey Weinstein.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850

I encourage you to check it out today.

28
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,609
Vanessa Ford is literally changing the world.

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,030
Originally from Jamaica and raised in Canada, her professional career started as a fashion

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,810
model at 14 years of age, appearing in music videos, commercials and catwalks around the

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,090
world.

32
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:00,010
She studied biology at the University of Toronto, going on to complete a master's degree in

33
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,650
tropical medicine at Oxford University in the UK.

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,530
Vanessa had a stint at the Weinstein Company.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,490
Alongside the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Nicole Kidman, she also worked as a producer

36
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,330
with Bob Marley's sons, Rowan and Ziggy, on the documentary, The Marley African Road Trip.

37
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,449
Vanessa is currently the Chief Operating Officer of Kukua.

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,250
And you know, I'd have to pick me up on that pronunciation, Vanessa, in a moment, because

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,530
I'm sure I haven't got that right.

40
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,909
A Kenyan-based education entertainment company that has a primarily female executive team.

41
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,289
Vanessa is the executive producer of the first African animated superhero series, Super

42
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:35,509
Senior.

43
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:47,870
Vanessa is a mother of three and manages her work between her home in Portugal and

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,949
Nairobi, Kenya.

45
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,009
What a remarkable and diverse life that you live, Vanessa.

46
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,449
It's great to see you today.

47
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:54,449
Wow.

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,590
What an intro.

49
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,889
Great to see you too, Luke.

50
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,009
Now, the pronunciation of your company, let me apologize on behalf of that.

51
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:02,669
Can you tell me?

52
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,909
Well, okay.

53
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,509
So it's pronounced Kukua.

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,770
Kukua is Swahili for to grow.

55
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,389
And also, Senma is Swahili for to speak up.

56
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,849
So we named our kind of chief, our number one character off of this idea of a little

57
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:27,349
girl who always speaks up, speaks her mind, never dilutes what she wants to say, is always

58
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,949
standing up for her friends.

59
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,250
And that was the kind of the thought process behind that.

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,509
Can't wait to delve into that.

61
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,969
Can't wait to delve into that more.

62
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,930
It's just a remarkable story of success and what you're doing.

63
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,509
As I said, it's literally changing the world.

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,590
But I might go back to the start a little bit.

65
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,610
14 years of age, it's young to travel the world and take on a modeling career.

66
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,870
Do you look fondly back at that chapter and has it helped you in your current life today?

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,030
Definitely.

68
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,629
I mean, I think it's been an absolutely unbelievable journey that I actually could not even have

69
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,889
dreamed for myself.

70
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,509
You know, being born and then raised in Toronto, but by parents.

71
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,810
Parents who both come from a small town in Treasure Beach, Jamaica, they came from

72
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,169
diametrically opposed backgrounds.

73
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,230
My mother is like a fashionista, ambitious corporate woman.

74
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:24,389
My dad is like a hippie, freestyle Jamaican guy, you know, and then falling in love and

75
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,649
having my sister and I.

76
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,649
And I think what was interesting about my experience growing up in Toronto, which is

77
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,889
the most multicultural city in the world, was that for me and most of my friends, I'm not

78
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:35,769
my own mom.

79
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,670
I think I was born and raised in Toronto, but my parents, my grandparents, my grandparents,

80
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,410
my cousins, my friends, we all had parents who were fresh off the boat from another

81
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,050
country.

82
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:51,170
So you were always like in between two very different worlds, you know, and you were

83
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,829
expected to speak both languages of those worlds to exist in both of those worlds, but

84
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,490
you never fully belong to either.

85
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,850
You know, that was a really important thing in a way for me to.

86
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:03,610
Almost.

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,329
Belong.

88
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:04,569
To myself.

89
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,709
14 you know everyone's like oh that's so young but actually I had already like prepared for that

90
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:19,149
you know going home entering the world where I smelled Jamaican food and hear patois and you know

91
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:25,769
and Bob Marley I'm playing on a record and then I'm going out to like oh literally opening the

92
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:32,470
doors to like snow and you know all these different cultures and I went to a French school

93
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:40,089
you know the only black kid in my in my class at the time so in a way that kind of prepared me

94
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:48,350
to kind of really be more independent be out on my own and you know studying at Oxford and getting

95
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,269
a university education I think I initially had wanted to just be on the runways and then eventually

96
00:05:54,269 --> 00:06:00,889
do acting but with again with that Caribbean parenting you know it was all about the only

97
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,730
doctor lawyer and that you have to go to university so you know when I was thinking of

98
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,829
of going to Oxford I thought oh let me study what I know I'm good at which is and at the time the

99
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,810
HIV pandemic was really kind of at the tip of everyone's toes and so I thought you know I want

100
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,410
to I want to save the world let me learn more about global health epidemiology maybe be a doctor

101
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,449
in infectious diseases find a cure for HIV and then I was like oh my god I'm going to go to

102
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,209
HIV and then I ended up making a documentary in Kenya about a community of indigenous people

103
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:46,449
who are grappling with HIV as part of my thesis which made me think you know why should I work

104
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:53,470
in a hospital trying to change one patient's behavior at a time when I can tell this intimate

105
00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:00,230
story about someone going through the same situation that not only inspires people to

106
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,230
change their behavior but can also

107
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:10,250
be shown to people all around the world and so so yeah I guess that documentary led to another

108
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,149
and then next thing you know I'm with Bob Marley's kids in South Africa traveling around on Ducati

109
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:26,209
bikes making a docu-series with the Discovery Channel and and then you know turned into

110
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:31,269
Weinstein Company working for a big major Hollywood studio

111
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,290
and then next thing you know I'm an entrepreneur working on three seasons making it to the cover

112
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,129
of Forbes Africa and being like one of the first black woman to be on the cover of Canada's biggest

113
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,870
magazine so I think the significance of these firsts and and also reading them in the headlines

114
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,449
also had a tremendous effect on my approach to like those leadership positions you've broken

115
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,110
your ground everywhere Vanessa when you you sum that up and it's as you said at the start it's a

116
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,589
remarkable diverse life and and there's a lot of drive in that isn't there to go and finish

117
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:12,629
tropical medicine and you're going to save the world from the HIV epidemic as it was at the time

118
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,389
and to have the the drive as you said maybe coming from the the Caribbean background I didn't realize

119
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,870
that's the thing is it that there's a bit of drive that comes out of families from that part of the

120
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,230
world I think it's just a bit of drive of the immigrant experience in general like moving to

121
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,330
a new country starting new starting a family especially

122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:38,610
you know and I think my parents instilled that especially my mom she was like the definition of

123
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,870
a multi-hyphenate like she was working three different jobs she was you know antique dealing

124
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,669
she had a corporate job in the bank she was selling kids clothes on the weekend there was

125
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:58,809
always something happening and and I think I definitely there's this kind of survival instinct

126
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,450
that comes from the immigrant experience that I think you get a lot of that and I think it's

127
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,409
instilled naturally if you're if you're born in that because you know they come to a new country

128
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:13,870
that is totally different from their own and they want to not only assimilate but thrive and so

129
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:21,529
in a way you have to make those sacrifices and you have to yeah you have to find your your your

130
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,830
story in this new world that is that must be incredibly proud I want to I want to jump to

131
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,450
super sema and the animated series you've produced with incredible success I think it's been viewed

132
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,529
you know way more than 120 million times for African and black kids to see a superhero that

133
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,769
looks like them on tv is simply brilliant and then you've added the layer of science and technology

134
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:50,029
which is your background and and using your mind as a superpower again is incredible tell us about

135
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,210
the genesis of that and again you must be incredibly proud of the impact that's having

136
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:02,450
definitely I'm so proud and I'm you know having also three kids who are super sema's number one

137
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:10,230
fan also also helped um but yeah I think uh you know my journey with super sema started off

138
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,529
as many people do like when they become a parent you know I always wanted to be a mom someday I

139
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:25,870
just wasn't necessarily expecting it to be that day so early on in my career and I think when my

140
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,450
first son was born and I thought about really what do I want to give to this world and you

141
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,669
know, it makes you it was like a necessary shake up. And it really allowed me to reprioritize my

142
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:43,789
life in that sense. Whereas I used to be the person who would be, you know, the first on set

143
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:49,590
in the morning, and the last person to leave after midnight. Now I have something not only to go home

144
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:57,110
to, but having a baby, you know, that baby needs their mom. But here's something that people don't

145
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,029
really say enough is that actually, that like mom needs their babies too, right? And I feel like

146
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:10,889
when I became a mom, I was like, I actually want to be present. I want to be there. I don't want

147
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:17,730
to be jumping on a plane to Malaysia to save, you know, a production or, you know, putting out fires

148
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,029
and all of these different worldwide productions that we were working on in the time. And I

149
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,090
realized that actually, what can I do to give

150
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,669
this next generation, i.e. my own children, something that I never had. And I grew up,

151
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:42,750
you know, turning on the television, opening a magazine, and I never saw anyone with my color

152
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:52,169
skin, my big afro. I never had those, that opportunity to like, look at myself as a six

153
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,769
or seven year old, as a hero. You know, thankfully, I had a

154
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:57,090
I had a

155
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,110
I had a

156
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:05,250
I walked into my house and I had my mom, I had my aunt, I had Auntie Oprah on television. But those

157
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,889
were really the only role models I had. And then when I took the trajectory of science and biology

158
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:18,610
and physics, you know, I never had a teacher that looked like me. I was often and so I thought,

159
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:27,090
wow, what if this superhero was not only a little black girl, but what if she, her superpowers were

160
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:33,710
were the things that I think superpowers are, which is science, technology, engineering, arts, and math,

161
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:40,809
the whole STEAM framework. So I was just, I got really excited about this idea and about making

162
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:48,870
sure that this next generation of children would be watching and consuming things where that could

163
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,970
empower them. And I think as storytellers, we have that, yeah, we have that obligation to really

164
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,070
change the narrative. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. And I think that's what I'm trying to

165
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,750
do. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. Like, that's, like,

166
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:04,090
it's our agenda, we have we're given that position, we're given that platform, rather than just

167
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,809
putting out another thing that's already there. I felt SuperSama was like the culmination of all of

168
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,669
these different threads of my life as well coming together, you know, working still in the

169
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:23,169
entertainment space, being able to pull out my old Hollywood contacts to, you know, rope in, you

170
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,049
know, superstars like Lupita Nyong'o and getting them involved.

171
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,809
But yet, like being a mother, understanding the importance of education, understanding the

172
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:40,649
importance of entertaining education, like learning, but in a fun way. I felt like all of

173
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:48,549
these aspects really made me like was kind of the brainchild that SuperSama was born under. And then,

174
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:56,870
of course, I met Lucrezia, who is the CEO of Cuckoo, and she was making these characters in an app.

175
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,629
And then I met my cousin, who's a really nice guy who was kind of a big fan of me,

176
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,269
but also, you know, she was, like, you know, she was a really nice person, and she was kind of a

177
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:12,389
kind of a big fan of me. And then, of course, I met my cousin, who was the CEO of Cuckoo, who was

178
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,129
kind of like a big fan of me. And then, of course, I met my cousin, who was kind of a big fan of me.

179
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,049
And then, of course, I made my children into the kids that taught children how to read and write.

180
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,990
And then us joining forces, me with my own entertainment background, her with her kind of tech,

181
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,350
on a worldwide platform with the help of YouTube Originals, to have one of Africa's biggest stars,

182
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,570
Lupita Nyong'o, involved, that just became the recipe of success. And the timing was perfect.

183
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:49,450
We released it March 2021, just after kind of the Black Lives Matter movement happened. And that

184
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:56,970
was a really crucial moment because the whole world, you know, was looking at inclusion and

185
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,590
diversity in a different way. And we were already doing it for the last two years, but, and trying

186
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,110
to knock on all the doors and, and see who would open. So finally the world was ready to also

187
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,730
receive and digest a show like ours. So it was really, really exciting.

188
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,289
And there's so many brilliant parts to that, Vanessa, to jump into. And

189
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:23,370
you know, I look at mainstream TV now and everything's the same. It's reality TV and

190
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,889
I consume none of it. None of it has any interest. And there's very few things that are unique. And

191
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,049
what I love is not only have you done something that's right in your passion wheelhouse and

192
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,309
clearly about changing the world as you want it to be, but there's a massive,

193
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,710
massive audience for it. People are ready for, and that must be so fulfilling to

194
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,570
get success at that level, as well as do something so good.

195
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,269
Totally, totally. And I think, you know,

196
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:54,330
I always think of this Toni Morrison quote, and she says, you know,

197
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:01,450
freeing yourself is one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another,

198
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,490
bit by bit she had claimed herself. And I think of that quote often for me, because for me,

199
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,610
claiming is active. It's like an active word that describes the way you go through life.

200
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,049
You know, you can go through life positively accepting and being like passive and being used

201
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:26,409
as part of someone's vision and purpose, or you can really claim space to be who you are and go

202
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:32,889
through life according to your own agenda. And I think that being a black woman, and especially,

203
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,049
you know, when I was working in a more corporate structure, I think there's a certain amount of

204
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:44,450
going against the grain that you feel every day, even just being present, like particularly when

205
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,809
your goal is to be fully authentically true to yourself.

206
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:54,730
It does feel like you're claiming and reclaiming your space. And I think for me,

207
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,409
SuperSemma was a bit of that as well. You know, I think, yeah, I think the whole kind

208
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:06,170
of claiming culture, that term kind of came back into popular lexicon when Maxine Waters

209
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:13,609
very publicly in the hearings said, you know, I'm reclaiming my time and she kept repeating it.

210
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,210
And there was something so powerful about this older black woman within a judicial

211
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:24,089
system telling a room full of white men that, you know, I'm reclaiming my time.

212
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:32,410
So I think there's something about reclamation and claiming that felt very relevant and triumphant.

213
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,410
And yeah, I want that. And I want to do that. And I want to move through my life,

214
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:46,569
claiming and reclaiming what I think I deserve and what I want. And I think SuperSemma reflects

215
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,910
that decision and also to become an entrepreneur.

216
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,490
And to say no to other offers. You know, I could have transitioned from

217
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,369
one big Hollywood studio to another. And I really decided to say no because I felt like I would,

218
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:06,730
I didn't want to be owned or to be claimed. I wanted to do something for myself.

219
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,970
I wanted to do something for my family. I wanted to build that legacy.

220
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,849
And Vanessa, I think you've reclaimed your hair as well, from what I understand.

221
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:19,130
You've got the most extraordinary hair that I've ever seen.

222
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,190
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,569
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:25,769
And is it true you used to spend hours just brushing it down and maybe conforming. And now

225
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:31,609
I think I read you say it's like a crown and it is an amazing Afro. It just seems I can't imagine

226
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:36,170
you without it. Tell us about that. Well, yes. I mean, first of all,

227
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:44,410
black girls and their hair, it's just a thing. We all grew up, especially 20 years ago,

228
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,130
the idea of like what was proper and good and not just like, yeah, I don't know, I'm just like,

229
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:56,369
just in society in general, but also in Caribbean and in many African American places, the idea of

230
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:04,789
like, you know, straight kind of pulled back, you know, quite Eurocentric features was, I mean,

231
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:11,970
that was the norm. And I remember fighting with my hair, sitting there, my mom combing, I would

232
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:21,130
cry, I would like, I wanted, you know, desperately to straighten it. And when I finally had this,

233
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:28,470
like, aha, you know, I remember going to interviews, and like, literally ironing my hair.

234
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:35,170
So at the time, I didn't, I couldn't even afford, like, a straight iron, my friends would sit there

235
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:41,710
and iron my hair for me. But this was also a big part of, you know,

236
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:49,529
not, how do I say, almost like not being seen, like, it was also a way, like, you didn't really

237
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:56,869
realize it. But in a way, it was kind of, it sounds a bit dramatic, but it's true. It's like,

238
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:04,470
you're aware that this is not just, it's a life force, but it's distracting. It tells something

239
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:11,150
about my history that maybe I don't want shown to the person that's interviewing me. It was really,

240
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,950
I think,

241
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:19,250
we wear a lot of masks. And I think, finally, letting my hair be free was also a reflection

242
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:27,470
of and like accepting it almost as my own superpower. My hair in a way is it's like my

243
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,029
calling card. It's like when I walk in a room, it's the thing that everyone reminds, you know,

244
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:41,089
remembers. You know, in a way, it was like, I knew that, like, my hair reflected my blackness,

245
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:41,950
and it's pure.

246
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:50,490
It's pure as form. I don't know, I wasn't sure if it was welcomed or understood, or respected in all

247
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:58,150
the rooms that I was in. And in a way, like me, allowing my hair to go natural, allowing it to be

248
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:05,390
big and beautiful and defy gravity, was me realizing also how to navigate these spaces

249
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,109
without compromising who I am.

250
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,509
It's an amazing story in itself, isn't it? When you describe it like that, and,

251
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,410
you know, you can't understand that coming from, you know, you look at me, I'm just happy to have

252
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,789
some hair. And I think, I look at you, and I just think it's, it's just amazing. You can never forget

253
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,230
Vanessa Ford, you know, how do you, you jump on the screen, and it's incredible, but not

254
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,809
understanding all that history that you explain that, you know, when you are the only black person

255
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,349
in a, in a room, or you work in a company where no one else looks like you, and you don't see

256
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,849
anyone else who looks like you. And what I love is that you've then put that onto the screen,

257
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,650
for hundreds of millions of people to see as a superpower, and you're living that, and it's cool.

258
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:54,509
What's even crazier, Luke, is that we obviously get a lot of fan mail, and comments, and on,

259
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:00,829
through our Instagram, and through our SuperSemma newsletter. What is so fascinating is that there

260
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:06,569
are literally hundreds of parents who have reached out to us who say, you know what,

261
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,710
after my child watched SuperSemma, they want to wear their hair natural.

262
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:17,470
After my child listened to, we have a song that's all about loving your hair. It goes,

263
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:26,490
I love my hair, I want to shout it out loud. And yeah, these moms and these dads are talking about

264
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,930
how their, their child has a whole new relationship with their hair, and with themselves, because

265
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,589
your hair becomes such a big part of your identity, and especially when you have, when it's

266
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,690
so big, it's almost becomes even, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

267
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:48,109
bigger than, than you would think if your hair was straight. So I think, in a way, with SuperSemma,

268
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,430
that was also a very powerful thing that we weren't even directly addressing. It was totally

269
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:59,829
indirectly that we realized, wow, this is, this is like an interesting phenomenon, because SuperSemma

270
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:06,329
has her natural Afro hair. She has a couple braids in it, which is something that African women do

271
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,569
all the time. We're always switching up our, our styles.

272
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,230
And I think when the dolls came out, we also saw, you know, the SuperSemma dolls,

273
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:23,990
kids were untying her hair, and like rebraiding it, doing different buns, repurposing, you know,

274
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,970
and I think, I think that was really special, because the dolls also help children to like,

275
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,589
to then look at something else that they can play with every day. And they're like, wow,

276
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,670
SuperSemma has hair, just like mine, I can touch and I can feel it. And it's just like,

277
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,970
like mine. And listen, she's a superhero, you press that button, and she's like,

278
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:51,490
anything is possible. And I'm unstoppable. And, you know, it's very small things that

279
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,750
when you're six or seven, those, like, that really makes a difference. That really

280
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,890
makes that six or seven year old believe that they can grow up and be an astronaut and have an

281
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,130
head of Afro hair that will fit inside that helmet.

282
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,630
I love it, Vanessa. I want to change text.

283
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,930
I want to go back to something you mentioned before, you're working for one of the biggest

284
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,130
Hollywood studios. And, and you said you knock back opportunities to go to other ones. And now

285
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,650
you've got essentially a really strong female executive, and you're working out of Nairobi,

286
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,890
and you're doing all these incredible things at SuperSemma is and, and remarkable. But on the

287
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:35,170
other side, you work for the Weinstein organization, and we know, founded by Harvey Weinstein. And

288
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,470
we heard the horror stories that came out of that. And it really founded the Me Too movement. On that

289
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,789
part of, of where the world went from there, do you look back and think a young female in that

290
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:49,950
world? Was it as challenging as it sounded to be part of the entertainment industry as a young

291
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,789
female in that era?

292
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:59,130
Yeah, I think it was definitely challenging. I think there was so especially as a woman, in

293
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,970
general, I mean, adding a woman of color is a whole other layer. But being a woman in the world,

294
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:10,410
yeah, it was it was very intimidating. Given that I had these preparations,

295
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:19,029
of being very independent early on already traveling 1516. I think that gave me a different

296
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:28,309
perspective. But I remember walking into Harvey's office one day, and always feeling like you're

297
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:34,269
shapeshifting. So I remember walking into Harvey's office one day, and I felt like he was, you know,

298
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:39,130
you can you just know when it's not a good day. And thankfully, I worked in the London office. So

299
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,410
we were very far away. And I remember walking into the office one day, and I felt like he was,

300
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:40,450
you know, you can you just know when it's not a good day. And thankfully, I worked in the London

301
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,150
office. So we were very far away. But I would come to New York and LA every now and again and

302
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:52,470
walking into that office and, and just like my stomach turning and having to sit there and

303
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,849
present this whole kind of marketing plan for this new acquisition that we wanted to do that

304
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:06,089
you he definitely didn't want to do. It was almost like seeing yourself from above,

305
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,430
like an out of body experience in a way, but I just,

306
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:19,069
you know, I just put on like my badass, kind of female power boss mode and just said, you know,

307
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:25,690
I gotta give it everything I got. And I went in there. And all of his ooming and aahing and like,

308
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:31,509
no, Vanessa, no, Vanessa turned like, I walked out of there with a yes, let's just put it that way.

309
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:38,630
And it was like, that was like an everyday thing. You know, and I think it also made you reach out

310
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,109
and create this like,

311
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:40,430
support system.

312
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,609
support network of other women, especially other black women who are not necessarily

313
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:51,250
at the Weinstein company, but who are in other positions of power in the entertainment space.

314
00:26:51,250 --> 00:27:00,369
And we created our own, we call it like the C-suites of like black female, like mentorship.

315
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:06,589
And we had our own dinners and we would, we would go out the same way how, you know,

316
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:15,210
no offense to you, Luke, but white men would go out on the golf course for centuries making deals

317
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,910
and like, you know, shooting around and chit-chatting and talking and kind of coaching

318
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,509
each other along in the business world. We had our own version of that in the kind of black

319
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:34,849
entertainment corporate space. And I think without that, I don't know if I could have,

320
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,089
I don't know if I could have, I don't know if I could have, I don't know if I could have

321
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:45,630
a really strong support system that really helped me to navigate those spaces. And I think right now

322
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:52,289
the entertainment space is a really interesting disrupted space. It really makes me excited to

323
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:58,089
be a part of the conversation because truthfully, I'm not interested in Hollywood for Hollywood's

324
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:06,490
sake. I've never been a capital F film head. Like I didn't go study film. I don't have,

325
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:13,750
the right last name or a trust fund. You know, I stumbled, I stumbled my way into film because I

326
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,450
really wanted to make a difference in the world by telling stories. My first documentary, which

327
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:25,509
actually was supposed to be a sidekick to my thesis, you know, ended up kind of kick-starting

328
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:29,990
this whole career. And then, you know, at my first job working at the Weinstein company,

329
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,890
the only opportunity there was to be a book scout. And I was like, yes, yes, yes, I'll do it. I'll do

330
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,549
it. And then I moved on to,

331
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:41,049
you know, I started working as a creative executive and head of productions and acquisitions.

332
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:47,250
You know, but when you look at my career, I think the red line has always been finding ways to make

333
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:55,210
what seems frivolous or superficial, like to infuse those conversations with depth and substance

334
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,609
and to connect it back to what is actually happening in the world. And I feel like that's my

335
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:06,569
lane within filmmaking. You know, don't get me wrong. I love actors. I love the Oscars, but

336
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,329
But for me, it's got to be deeper than that.

337
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,849
You know, it's got to be more than just a Hollywood ending.

338
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:18,849
And in a way, I feel like I'm a bit of a wild card because I'm always looking at everything through a cultural lens.

339
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,049
Like, how does this connect to the broader conversation, the broader context?

340
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:29,190
Because I really believe that film doesn't exist in a vacuum, at least not today.

341
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:36,829
You can't just put anything on screen on a movie theater and not expect to start conversations, good or bad.

342
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:45,910
You know, you have to be really thoughtful about the content and the context of what your content exists in.

343
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:55,670
So in this day and age with social media, you know, people care so much about who is making the films and how the films, like, who are behind it.

344
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,390
So it's not just what the films look like.

345
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:58,430
Right.

346
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:08,470
For me, it's like, what would I, like, what I would say about this moment is that there's so much that's happening in the world that can inspire a director or a storyteller.

347
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,970
There's so much disruption in the world of entertainment right now, but it's such a hard business.

348
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,990
So to be in it, especially in this day and age, you have to have a strong why.

349
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,950
You have to know why you are here.

350
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:28,390
You need to be able to translate that for this new era of viewers who want to, who really want to know what you're,

351
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:36,890
why is, you know, they want to know what you stand for, what your why stands for on top of giving them content that they want to just watch.

352
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:47,569
So I think the last thing, the last thing I'll say is in terms of creativity in this moment, there's like an overwhelming creativity because especially coming out of the pandemic,

353
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:55,690
so many people almost lost their businesses, their jobs, or did lose their businesses and are fighting back from these low points.

354
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,269
So I just think there's just fresh new energy.

355
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:12,269
And there's that new energy is feeling, you know, feeding into this entertainment space, I think it's a little bit more grounded than we've been in a while, because now it's like, what do people actually want to see and consume?

356
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:18,170
I feel like it needs to be a little bit more real or grounding in the stories that are being told.

357
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:24,769
And then you can also see the complete opposite of the spectrum, which is like, we've been in a pandemic for three years.

358
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,029
I just want to dream.

359
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:27,769
I want to put out the most.

360
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:28,390
Yeah.

361
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:35,809
Over the top fantastical content ever because it's an art form and I want to inspire from that space.

362
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:41,829
So I feel like you can see, you see, like you walk into a movie theater and you see both ends of the spectrum.

363
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,930
There's a place for both art forms right now.

364
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,930
And for me, Super Sema is a part of that.

365
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:49,710
You know, it's telling a why.

366
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:57,849
It's a story of me as a black woman and mother and producer wanting to make something for children.

367
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,329
But it's also.

368
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:15,789
It's also a story of my whole team of women from all over the world who are, like, egging on to, like, change the way, you know, the next kind of generation of role models and the way kids look at science and some of these further subjects.

369
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,549
So it's a very interesting space.

370
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:27,849
And I understand the Williams sisters and Oprah, that community have been great supporters of yours and picking up on what you said before.

371
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:33,329
And I think that, you know, the pandemic and the COVID, the creativity coming out of it, I think is real, isn't it?

372
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,470
People got locked in their homes for that time and it gave you time to stop and reflect and think.

373
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:41,849
I think there is this burst of creativity that's going on in the world.

374
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:55,869
And that's part of where I had the great privilege to intersect with you, Vanessa, in a thing we call Alita Connect and to have you part of our sort of growing community around the world of getting incredible thinkers like you together and learning from you.

375
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,849
And your world could not be more different.

376
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:06,049
And I love the fact that you've got a group of people from Troy Flanagan, who's the head of high performance at Milwaukee Bucks, Tyson Ballard.

377
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,490
I don't even know how to explain Tyson.

378
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:08,269
He's a polymath.

379
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,329
I think everything he does, he's legendary.

380
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:12,609
Hugh Van Kylenburg from the Resilience Project.

381
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:16,910
Amit Baines is a great friend of mine and does incredible work in his role as CEO.

382
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,650
So can you tell us about that experience of Alita Connect, Vanessa, for you?

383
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:26,109
The Alita Connect experience for me has been, like, transformational.

384
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:42,009
And not to put that as a soundbite, but it actually has because I met people that I would never have met from totally different spheres, from all walks of life, and throw us into a room where we're sitting there.

385
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:49,349
And what was so surprising about the Alita Connect group was that how vulnerable we got so soon.

386
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:55,849
Like, I was expecting that by week five, maybe people would start talking about their children.

387
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,670
By week one, we were talking about childhood trauma.

388
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:06,289
We were talking about, you know, unpacking some of our deepest, darkest secrets, you know.

389
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:15,690
And I realized through that group that, you know, also, even though it wasn't a group of Black women, we're all connected.

390
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:25,829
We all have all these different, as leaders, we have these strings of and patterns and situations that we all encounter.

391
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:26,090
So.

392
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:45,690
So even if one person is sitting on an NBA court, you know, paneling this incredible team to win a championship, and the other is signing, you know, government papers in Colombia, we all actually are going through the same things.

393
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,050
And it's very basic.

394
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,690
It's all about, you know, priorities.

395
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,530
It's about family.

396
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,409
It's about mental health.

397
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,710
It's about self-care.

398
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:13,269
You know, and so that's what I realized in the Alita Connect more than anything is that how much we're all connected, how much sharing each other's stories and being very vulnerable in our leadership styles actually was, for me, the superpower of Alita.

399
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:18,670
It wasn't just that I learned these unique leadership styles.

400
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,230
It was more that, actually, you know what?

401
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:25,349
Honesty and transparency and being authentic.

402
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,670
That's what true leadership is.

403
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,969
And leadership revolves are all around people.

404
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,150
So, you know, it's all about relationships.

405
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,150
It's all about how we communicate.

406
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:46,849
And I think we have this idea that leadership sits in this book of the 25, you know, habits of highly effective leaders.

407
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:55,670
But actually, leadership is like what you do in your everyday space, how you treat your family, how you treat your employees.

408
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:01,030
How you live and kind of breathe in this world.

409
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,309
And that was what I really realized in the Alita Connect group.

410
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:14,869
I was kind of going there searching for, you know, the top five leadership, you know, junkets that I'll get from that group.

411
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:25,630
But I left, actually, with a community of friends and a kind of support system and a network of guys that I can call on and vice versa.

412
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,989
You know, for life.

413
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,949
I wasn't expecting that.

414
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,090
I was thinking this is six weeks of a fun ride, of meeting new people.

415
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,489
And then after that, we're all going to go on our separate ways.

416
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,849
But we have a very active, you know, group that we're all communicating on WhatsApp.

417
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,090
We keep in touch.

418
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,610
We're supporting each other.

419
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:55,610
And somehow when you, I think, also what the Alita Connect group does that is so powerful is when you bring two people.

420
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,230
Two people from two totally different worlds, two careers, two paths together.

421
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,849
There's no ego.

422
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:10,949
There's no like, oh, I have to be, you know, be bigger or better or, you know, there's all of that dissipates.

423
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,769
And so it just leaves room for the real you.

424
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:24,510
And I think that's what Alita gave me was the real, was bringing back the real me and really connecting to my own leadership system.

425
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,650
Nothing I've ever heard.

426
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,130
I've never heard a better description ever.

427
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,309
Vanessa, you couldn't write that if you tried.

428
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:36,030
And I think for us, that was part of the joy of, it felt like the world had retreated back to our silos a little bit.

429
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,929
And we stuck to the things that we knew that were familiar.

430
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,710
And it was all about what I could get and how I could gain.

431
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:48,150
In generalisation, it felt like the world had drifted into that path and we've lost connections a lot.

432
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:53,769
And the ability to show up and meet someone totally random that we didn't know or weren't from our background.

433
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,650
And you described that so beautifully.

434
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:56,230
Isn't it?

435
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,170
There are people that would probably never come into your walk of life.

436
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:08,110
And likewise, I'm sitting here in Melbourne with someone of Jamaican heritage from Canada who's changing the world in the most extraordinary way.

437
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,670
And I love the randomness of it and how, you know, I'm learning so much from every word you're saying.

438
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:19,210
And that's the beauty, I think, of growing these communities and understanding people better and understanding my background is so different.

439
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:25,230
And I couldn't walk in your shoes, but maybe I can have more empathy now and understand what it's like for someone who doesn't get to know me.

440
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,590
Who doesn't get to see themselves in that image all the time.

441
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,610
And I think that's how we learn better.

442
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,550
That's how we share.

443
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,070
And that was a beautiful way that you described it, Vanessa.

444
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:40,769
We had this great privilege as that community has grown of seeing these patterns around what we think our leadership looks like in different settings.

445
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,510
And I want to ask you a handful of questions on that.

446
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,949
And we start with self-leadership, Vanessa.

447
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:53,949
We think it's hard to lead anyone else as a mother, as a CEO or anything without understanding your own sense of self-leadership.

448
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,210
What does self-leadership mean to you?

449
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:02,230
Self-leadership for me is about being myself.

450
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,809
And I'll keep it very simple, but it's really about being my authentic self.

451
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:14,650
And it's about also understanding that I am the captain of my own ship.

452
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:25,210
It's about what I spoke about earlier, about claiming space, you know, really owning my decisions and being confident in them.

453
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:32,989
And also, for me, it's also about self-leadership also is about breaking down barriers.

454
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:47,730
So cracking those glass ceilings and getting myself into spaces, you know, without compromising who I am, where someone that looks like me has never been so that I can pave the way for others to do the same.

455
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,789
And for me, that's a big part of what self-leadership means to me.

456
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,010
Beautifully said.

457
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,789
We see these.

458
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:01,630
Because diverse leaders are really conscious of how, on a daily basis, they positively impact people in their environment.

459
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:06,190
And I really think a lot about that positive impact on a day-to-day basis.

460
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,349
How have you gone about impacting people positively?

461
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:19,489
Well, I think, I mean, beyond just being a good person, I think, and how you define that.

462
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,570
And beyond changing the world at a global level as well.

463
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,130
So we're going to leave that part in as well.

464
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,590
But on a day-to-day?

465
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:29,409
Yeah, on a day-to-day.

466
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:40,190
I think, you know, for me, I think a big, you know, outwardly in the world, what looks like, it probably looks like SuperSama is my main focus.

467
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,090
You know, we have three seasons.

468
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,849
We have toys and books.

469
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:49,309
But I think I've been thinking more and more about stepping back and going inwards.

470
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,050
And also just being really present with my family.

471
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,510
Making sure that I'm still, I'm still feeding all these different projects and these things.

472
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:17,429
But for me, it's also being a good person is also about being, you know, being kind to myself, a little bit more kind to myself and being able to do all the things I want to do without giving up one of those things.

473
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:23,889
So I think it's about being out in the world and allowing one project to feed into the next.

474
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:25,210
One feeds the other.

475
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,309
And when that entity is big enough, it gets strong enough to feed the next.

476
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:32,690
And so it's kind of a circle of fulfillment.

477
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,610
And in a way, that's how I've lived my life.

478
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,329
I've never been someone who's been in one box, doing one thing.

479
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,130
People step into my office and they can't believe that I have a science degree on my wall.

480
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:55,210
Or like seeing my, all like my Harry Potter Oxford photos and understanding that, you know, that analytical mind went then into storytelling.

481
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,150
And then animation and now making music.

482
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:06,090
And just not having these self-limiting beliefs has been a way that I've been able to inspire others.

483
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:18,869
And through like mentorship and with my employees and my own children, friends, you know, always being there for people and making sure that I make time for the things and the people that I care.

484
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:24,869
Vanessa, we're also fascinated about how people like you who do things at the level of your own.

485
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,610
Well, you are go about creating and sharing your vision.

486
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,949
How have you gone about that?

487
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:43,719
Well, obviously, like with SuperSama, for example, the vision has been a culmination of many things as I've grown.

488
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:53,500
But I think the number one way that I've been able to kind of express my vision has just been in doing.

489
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,539
Like I'm not someone who really has been.

490
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:06,420
I had my shine very early on in my career, you know, doing modeling and acting and being on screen.

491
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:21,099
But then I think what's been most powerful for me has been going behind the scenes, actually, and picking up that pen and paper and writing and being like digging my hands deeper into the creative, into the creative elements.

492
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:26,320
And when people around you see you, not just talking about it.

493
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:35,320
But actually doing the work, I think that it just naturally inspires them to also want to do that.

494
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:42,619
And I think my vision has always been so big, you know, I've never been someone who's just like, oh, I want to get from here to there.

495
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:56,219
It's like, no, I want to change the world and and and getting people to jump on kind of our Kukua rocket ship that I like to call it and like blast off without, you know, leaving.

496
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:08,559
And I think that's been a testament to that has been like we literally we will in the SuperSumma office, we have a wall of all these women that we really believe in.

497
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:10,679
And we had Lupita up there.

498
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,659
We had Serena.

499
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,659
We had Oprah.

500
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,500
And it's still there.

501
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:21,019
We had all these pictures of all these women that we and we always said one day these women are going to walk through this office.

502
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:26,199
And just the fact that we've had, you know, not only some of those women, but also some of those women that are going to walk through this office.

503
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:35,719
Some of those women walk in our office, but some of them support us, some of them being investors, some of them being a part of our company and like believing in our vision.

504
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,659
That is like that says it all.

505
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,719
That is incredible, isn't it?

506
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:50,659
To have literally manifested that, have it on the wall and suddenly you have got the Williams sisters and Oprah and all of those legendary people in your corner.

507
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,679
Curiosity is a word that comes up a lot in the world of a leader and we see people so curious.

508
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,000
And through that, Vanessa, they're constantly growing and learning.

509
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:02,320
Is curiosity something that strikes a chord with you?

510
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,039
Big time.

511
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:10,119
I mean, I think curiosity is like the bedrock of like childlike wonder.

512
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:21,639
And for me, especially working in the children's space and making toys and books and like that is literally that like curiosity is the beginning of like unlocking your imagination.

513
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,260
So, I mean, I live and breathe curiosity.

514
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,159
It's like the one thing.

515
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:34,739
I try to get back to because I feel as an adult, you know, having been on this earth for longer than, you know, my childhood days.

516
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:44,800
It's like you're everything has like around you kind of closes that off, like wants to make you put you in a less creative, less curious space.

517
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:53,119
And I feel like, honestly, you know, even with our super semi team, we often just say, let's get into that sandbox.

518
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,760
Let's be creative.

519
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,719
Let's be curious.

520
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,139
And let's.

521
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,059
Let's play like it was literally that moment of like, let's go into the sandbox and play.

522
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,400
When do we ever play with this doll?

523
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:11,780
When do we ever, you know, get kids off the screen and into like actually creating and doing things?

524
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:21,880
And in order to do that, we have to do that, not just with our own children, but like with ourselves, with how we think about new ideas, how we pilot new ideas of episodes.

525
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:26,099
We are sitting there like playing around with.

526
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:36,019
Lego thinking of how can we, you know, how can super summon this next episode, save her pet goat using a GPS system that she has to technobate.

527
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,780
This is all comes from being curious and like wildly curious.

528
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:48,659
So I think curiosity is, is, is a big word for, for me and a, and a big part of my creative process.

529
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,780
And Vanessa communicating with clarity is another dimension we love asking about.

530
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,940
And that is your world is what.

531
00:46:56,179 --> 00:47:05,559
You've been able to tell great stories, whether it's the Mali African road trip or the productions that you're on into doing this animated spectacular series.

532
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,300
I mean, you must be pretty sophisticated about how you communicate.

533
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,460
Have you given that thought or is it just getting in the sandbox and playing as you just said?

534
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,719
I've definitely given it thought.

535
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,619
There's no doubt.

536
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:20,800
I think communication is so important.

537
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,900
So I've definitely spent a lot of time watching and learning.

538
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:55,559
Some of my role models in that world, for me, communication is, has always been about just getting face to face with someone looking into their eyes, holding a hand, like communication has never, my style of communication has never been like, let me get on top of, on that Ted Ted X conference stage, even though I'm doing those things now deliver, delivering the keynote at web summit was definitely.

539
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:56,059
Yeah.

540
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:05,659
You know, had me sweating a couple of bullets, but, um, but the truth is that like my communication style is much more, um, intimate.

541
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:14,840
It's much more, I feel I get much more out of it when I'm with someone and I, and like the communication is not always verbal.

542
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:23,300
It's like, it's, it's in the subtle ways that, that someone inches a little bit closer to hear what you have to say.

543
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,980
It's in the way that someone reaches out.

544
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:26,139
Okay.

545
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,360
And it's a patchy when you're, you know, when something makes you emotional.

546
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:40,820
And I think for me, that's in a way been my superpower as well, because as a leader, I'm not just about being the type a, you know, I'll tell you what to do.

547
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,579
I'm ultra assertive.

548
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:51,440
I'm this, I'm that I can be that, but a big part of my leadership strength is also the vulnerability is also the empathy.

549
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,920
It's also the understanding.

550
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:55,440
And I think that communication.

551
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:17,539
That's a little bit more nurturing and a little bit more, um, as a little bit more subtle, surely has been a way that I've been able to also communicate my vision and bring people along for the ride because they don't just have to hear me say the words they can feel it.

552
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:24,480
They're touched by, they can, they hear the trembling in my voice when they know it means so much to me.

553
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,119
Um, and I think.

554
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:34,239
Yeah, I think in a way that's been something that has been a game changer in terms of how I look at the way I communicate.

555
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,760
Vanessa, how important has collaboration been for you?

556
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,820
Collaboration's been everything for me because at the end of the day, you know, when we started SuperSamo, we had no money.

557
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,340
We had just this brilliant idea.

558
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,280
We had to get people to believe in us.

559
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,480
We had to raise money.

560
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,920
We had to find VCs.

561
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
And, and leave.

562
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:05,539
And then when you had, when we had like the, the, the creators who, who agreed to jump on this bandwagon when there was, was nothing like ours that existed.

563
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:09,800
Um, it's much easier when you have like a clear prototype.

564
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:15,739
And when we were alive, we want to be the Disney, the Disney of learning from Africa to the world.

565
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,800
How do you communicate that without like something that you can, you can tangibly see or feel?

566
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,840
So I think.

567
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,159
We've needed a lot of people on this road, on this road show in order to make this happen.

568
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:25,639
Absolutely.

569
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,880
this happen. Even right now, we're working with a lot of partners, licensees in order to get

570
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:38,440
Supersend to many different spaces and to get on shelves and to get her into books and to get her

571
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,519
on when you open your Spotify, you know, we want you to hear her music and that's all through

572
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:50,320
collaboration. I think we would not have been where we are today with her. The Disney of learning

573
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,239
from Africa to the world. Now there's a big vision and on the way to creating it, I think

574
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,960
it's an incredible story. Vanessa, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

575
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,239
I know this is going to sound cliche, but it's definitely been my mother. I mean, everything

576
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:13,699
always comes back to her. She's always been the one that I've looked up to, the one that's always,

577
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:19,860
you know, calling me and reminding me like what's important. She's always like, oh, God is good.

578
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,880
You have to, you know, you have to think about the bigger, like she's connected me to a spiritual

579
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:31,559
side of myself that also makes me think more than, you know, what is here on this earth. Like it's so

580
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,539
much bigger than that. And I think my mom has, beyond just being my biggest fan, has been

581
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:42,599
definitely my biggest role model from when I was holding her hand, sitting in antique shops,

582
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:49,039
watching her, you know, buy and sell things and watching how she navigated all these different

583
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:49,559
spaces.

584
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:57,980
She went from being a boss lady in a bank to being a boss lady in an antique market stall. Like for

585
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:04,780
me, that is just like, wow. Seeing that very early on just makes you think, okay, anything is possible.

586
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,960
And Vanessa, I love it when someone immediately, you know, references that a mother or a parent or

587
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,599
mother and father, you realize how lucky you are. You have someone in your life

588
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,300
like that. And obviously for you straight away, that was an instant. There wasn't a lot of delay,

589
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,420
it was, you know, the inspiration of your mom. And you, you know, obviously you're passing that

590
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:29,679
onto your beautiful three, three children in such a powerful way. And I'm not surprised that that

591
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,539
answer came out. And we're a bit obsessed with the collaboration, Vanessa, in Alita and what

592
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:40,579
collaboration looks like now on a global scale. And I'm fascinated by the Supasema office and

593
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:46,340
on the board was Oprah and these incredible inspirational figures. There'd been one person

594
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,300
you could think of that you'd love to collaborate with that, you know, and you've got so many people

595
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,139
and so many passions. Maybe it is the SEMA work. Is there, is there a name that you could

596
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:00,400
reference that you'd love to work with? Oh, that is a very good question.

597
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:08,800
I think for me, the one person that I would like would really rock my world and like push

598
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:16,179
Supasema, push me into other territories is definitely the director, Ava DuVernay.

599
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:19,840
She is already, she has blown,

600
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:27,460
trailblazed through Hollywood at being, you know, the first black director to box office over a

601
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:35,300
billion dollars, the first black female director to, to be nominated for Oscars. I mean, but beyond

602
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,079
that, she is just, you know, having known people who work with her, you know, she's such a visionary

603
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:47,260
and she looks at things in, in totally different ways. And like what I was saying, she really

604
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,860
takes things in, in like a contextual way.

605
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:58,300
And so for me, it would be such a dream to work with someone like Ava, because she, I know I would

606
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:05,599
learn so much from her watching how she not only tells a story, but also she would take something

607
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:11,820
like what we have and bring it to life in a totally different way. I've been dreaming about

608
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:19,840
a Supasema movie for a long time. So the idea of going from a television series to then,

609
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,480
you know, a lot, a movie directed by Ava DuVernay would literally,

610
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,320
that would be a game changer for me. I think I could die a happy woman with that.

611
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:36,980
And anyone who's read what you do would have no doubt that that is entirely possible. And I'm not,

612
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,400
not surprised at all in the future if that happens. Can you tell, what are some of Ava's

613
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,579
works that we would know? I've got to admit, I'm not familiar. What's some of the stuff that would

614
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,119
be well known to us?

615
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:59,940
Probably the most well-known Selma. That one she did, she really did a lot of work.

616
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:07,440
Yeah, that's huge. And then she also, she did the 13th, which was the documentary series about

617
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,639
kind of corporal punishment in the U.S. and nominated for an Oscar. And then, you know,

618
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,860
she's also been, she's pretty much gotten nominated for every award possible.

619
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,840
Even short films like Say Yes. And she's done also the first Black female director to direct a

620
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:36,900
Disney film. And so I think she has, she has just like been a groundbreaking role model for the

621
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,539
whole Hollywood world because, you know, her as a director totally changes also the landscape of

622
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:47,400
how the story is told and what perspective you're looking at. And I think she's really opened it up

623
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,300
in a way, in the way that our conversation is opening up.

624
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:56,360
For you, that's like what she's done for like the whole world is open up this space of like looking

625
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:04,179
at, you know, some of these, looking at a Disney movie from a Black female perspective, you know,

626
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:08,800
and that hasn't been done before. So, yeah, pretty powerful stuff.

627
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:16,019
Pretty powerful and super Selma the movie coming to your screens at some stage. And I'm waiting and

628
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:19,420
would not be surprised at all. Vanessa, it's been a great privilege to spend some time with you.

629
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,960
Thank you so much.

630
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,239
Thank you for sharing your story. It is literally changed the world, as we said,

631
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,440
and thank you for taking the time today. And it's been great to catch up with you.

632
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,179
Really appreciate it.

633
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:33,619
