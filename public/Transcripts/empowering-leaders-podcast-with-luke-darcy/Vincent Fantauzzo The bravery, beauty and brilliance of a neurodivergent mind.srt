00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,730
I always felt connected to Heath. I knew this was something special. I painted like a maniac

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,169
and I finished it three weeks later. I sent it to him and he passed that night.

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,269
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast. At Alita, we are

4
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,829
passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration. Our signature

5
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,210
program Alita Connect curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse backgrounds in

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,869
the sport, industry, social venture and the arts who come together to learn, to connect

7
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:34,609
and to collaborate.

8
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,670
It's been amazing. Here you are on this Zoom call, feeling within the first session like

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,350
you intimately know these people and care for them. And then all of a sudden realising

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,210
that even though you're in totally different industries, we're all going through the same

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,609
thing or we've been through it and we can help each other.

12
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:04,730
Or there's just this hurdle that you can't see past and then you share it with the group

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,310
and there's five answers in 40 minutes and you think, I have not slept for two weeks

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,969
thinking about that. Like, how is this possible?

15
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,450
You're listening to stories and the breadcrumbs of what makes success and I constantly get

16
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,250
something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups because we're all living the same stuff, aren't

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:27,370
we?

18
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:27,950
Yeah.

19
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,590
Extraordinary people.

20
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,469
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience. What happens there is magical.

21
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,810

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,590
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is one of the world's most respected

29
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,550
and talented artists, Vincent Fantuzzo. Known for his iconic portraits, Vincent's incredible

30
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,889
talent has captured the essence of people like Heath Ledger, Sir Paul McCartney, Australia's

31
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,169
first female prime minister, Julia Gillard, and even met his wife, Asha Keddie, while

32
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:26,969
painting her portrait.

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:27,930
His work speaks for itself. He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist.

34
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:27,949
He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist.

35
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,610
His work speaks to not only his technical genius, but to his ability to capture the

36
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,069
essence of his subjects with a striking intimacy and connection. As the great artist David

37
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,530
Hockney once said, Vincent's work is not just about capturing a likeness, but capturing

38
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,469
the soul of his subjects. Vincent's remarkable story is told with incredible honesty in

39
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:51,669
his brilliant memoir, Unveiled. Vincent grew up in the commission housing in Melbourne's

40
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:57,110
Broad Meadows, severely dyslexic, left school at 14 years of age, and looked on the path

41
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,930
to crime and self-defense. He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist.

42
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,069
He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist. He's a great artist.

43
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,069
His evolution from a severely troubled upbringing to a powerhouse in the art world is nothing

44
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,129
short of incredible. With numerous awards, including multiple Archibald Prize nominations,

45
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:14,590
and his work hanging in prestigious collections worldwide, Vincent is a true leader in every

46
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,509
sense in the Australian art world. Great to meet you, Vincent. I heard so much about you,

47
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,629
mate. Thanks for taking the time.

48
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,310
Thanks, Luke. I'm going to get you to call my wife and tell her how lucky she is after

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:24,490
that.

50
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,490
You often think when you sit down and you read someone's...

51
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:35,349
bio back to them what do you what's your immediate thought i feel like it's a pinch myself thing but

52
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:42,189
it's also when you struggle and you have to hustle a lot of your life there's always that imposter

53
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:49,509
syndrome you know hovering over you so i know i am but i hope i am all that you wrote a brutally

54
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,830
honest memoir and it's it's it's sensational and reading it in preparation for this there was

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,830
an honesty and i understand you you spoke about things you hadn't spoken to

56
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:07,430
your wife ash or anyone about before how was that experience very emotional journey also like very

57
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,330
therapeutic as well um i kind of refer to like having therapy but i was getting paid so that

58
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,889
was good the only problem is i did all this therapy and now it's in a book for everyone to

59
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:24,810
read so it is a bit scary but i've had just even during this book tour i've had this incredible

60
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:32,250
response from very overwhelming response touching things i just didn't know art and a book could

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,009
have you know this power and i feel uh really humbled by it i think vincent it's a bit more

62
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:43,689
than art and a book it's your your story's remarkable a lot of people listening around

63
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:48,189
the world might know you know what it's like your parents came through the immigration

64
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:54,470
camps in broad meadows it was an extraordinarily tough upbringing and you found yourself

65
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:01,610
you know being arrested at one stage and in a few stages a few stages and we left a couple out and

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,129
and you know potentially going down this this path of self-destruction as i said in the introduction

67
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,189
can you give a sense to people just what it was like for you growing up you know i lived in fear

68
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:18,850
a lot um it was a bit of the wild west um i think you know there's five of us kids

69
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,649
then after my father left it was my mom and five kids

70
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:29,990
and i felt uh you know even though i was very surrounded i felt quite alone and quite scared

71
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:37,069
i know tough upbringings come in all different ways like mine was you know there's poverty and

72
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:42,730
violence and a few other things and but there's also kids in a privileged background that have a

73
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,230
tough upbringing and as there's a kid in a slum in india with a smile on his face because he's loved

74
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,329
and as a kid in a private school could be sexuality could be his parents aren't around and it's just

75
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,810
as tough i always try and do my best to be a good kid and i've always tried to be a good kid and i've

76
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:00,110
you know we can be very like-minded and have the same struggles from different backgrounds

77
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,569
vincent i heard someone say to me once that you know if you grew up in your circumstances

78
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,850
and a single parent and there was abuse and people sort of expect that it should be tough

79
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,430
but you're probably right if you grew up with a wealthy family and you neglected it no one really

80
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,170
cares about your story do they and they don't or you've had you've had it easy it's almost

81
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,589
a harder path in some ways is that is that possible yeah like even now people

82
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:30,629
will you know if they didn't know this story they might look at me as a privileged middle-aged

83
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:37,750
white guy living a dream and there's a lot more to all people like there's a story there and

84
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:46,350
it's why i love my job because i get to experience learn and explore people's stories and i think i

85
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,949
feel people's energy a lot if they're if it's dark i feel it if it's happy if it's dangerous

86
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,670
so it's it's a very emotional

87
00:06:54,829 --> 00:07:01,689
journey also i should explain that listening to me talk is a bit like watching the tv and

88
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:07,889
someone keeps flicking their channels because i forget uh with my dyslexia adhd spectrum all of

89
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,649
those things are kind of what was the question i want to ask you about the severe dyslexia which

90
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:19,490
is a big part of of your life and and just how brutal the school system was for you growing up

91
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,709
but no concessions vincent's not intelligent you know he's not listening

92
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:30,050
how did this extraordinary artist emerge out of that and can you can you give us an insight

93
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,089
um i was in brazil recently and they don't speak much english there and everything's in another

94
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:43,189
language and uh you know it's a bit like that as a kid like everywhere you go um you can't read

95
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:50,269
anything you you know you're in a class and the teacher's writing on a board and you already feel

96
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,209
stupid and you don't want anyone to know so you

97
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:03,550
learn to pretend then you feel like a liar and a fake and what baffles me is i got through

98
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,290
the whole of school i didn't pass one thing i couldn't even write my street name down i didn't

99
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,370
even know what street i lived in dyslexia is not just reading and writing and maths it's

100
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:21,009
it's thinking and it's memory memory has a big part to play it's different for all people i mean

101
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,750
it's so complex i could talk about it all day you can have einstein maths

102
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:32,409
genius and he can't write you can have someone that's quite academic but their memory is shot i

103
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:40,289
fortunately i got all of them saying that i now know the gifts of dyslexia adhd and all those

104
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,929
diversities but at the time i was just um i would have loved to love school and i hated it

105
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:52,090
and what you're saying i think is such a topical thing and there'll be people listening and all of

106
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,809
us are parents we just want people to just love it

107
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,889
kids unconditionally regardless of and all of us have got blind spots was the word i'm searching

108
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,970
for but is it possible you went through these enormous challenges and there was not a lot of

109
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,529
care for you but do you think the way your brain works it's turned on this superpower of creativity

110
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:17,230
i know there's a creative genius i can see it in your work but but do you think that's what's come

111
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,269
out of the fact your brain doesn't work to read and write it's so turned on in their other ways

112
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,049
you connect with people

113
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:24,809
definitely

114
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,090
definitely now i realize at the time i just thought i was different so i was in a special

115
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,610
class special class has the blind kid deaf kid wheelchair me kid with Tourette's yelling and

116
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,529
all all of us misfits in one class and yeah but see this it's a real thing forget the question

117
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:50,110
just run it by me one more time yeah just the idea that there's a superpower in the way that

118
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,950
yes our brain works so if you're blind you develop your hearing

119
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,809
i have a brain i have a brain i have a brain i have a brain i have a brain i have a brain i have a brain

120
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,470
i had no way of learning you know i would watch tv to try and learn you know i know a lot about

121
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,909
you know the simpsons and seinfeld and all those things i learned through conversation and i was

122
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,610
the annoying kid that was asking too many questions i couldn't tell people that's the

123
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:19,169
only way i can learn and i think one you're hiding and you learn to hustle to keep a secret

124
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:24,629
so you're developing a sense of something there you start to understand people

125
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:31,090
and their emotions so you develop a different way of communicating so sometimes it's non-verbal

126
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,669
sometimes it's the energy of someone the look on their face you know it's like uh you can become a

127
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:43,710
lie detector you know like you'd feel i know what you're thinking right now adhd dyslexia all the

128
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:51,590
autism um some of these kids people adults old people they can be in a room at a party having

129
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,809
conversation listening to two other conversations and they're not going to be able to communicate

130
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,090
and noticing someone in the corner that no one's talking to and thinking about how they can help

131
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,950
them and also thinking about what they're going to cook for dinner and that can be overwhelming

132
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,990
and it can cause anxiety but it's also an incredible gift to have this and i heard a

133
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,590
teacher recently described that 20 years ago there was maybe three kids that they required special

134
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:24,210
attention for to support their education he's saying in year 12 there's three and a half

135
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:24,809
classrooms and they're not going to be able to cook for dinner and they're not going to be able to

136
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:24,850
cook for dinner and they're not going to be able to cook for dinner and they're not going to be able to

137
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,549
full of neurodivergent kids that we're now identifying more and more of so you've sort of

138
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:37,409
blazed this pathway i'm sure it's reassuring to people to go you know we just need to find what

139
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:42,690
these people are passionate about is that too simple a way to to describe it or no that's

140
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:50,190
that's pretty accurate and i would like to think that in diagnosing things like i don't want it to

141
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,809
be something people want because it seems cool or flavor of the month or they're trying to

142
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:01,590
answer a question for their child or themselves and it might not be that like sometimes you know

143
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,710
diversity is caused by you know a problem at home mental health all sorts of things when it comes to

144
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:16,289
these kids that you know have actually a neurodiverse situation a lot of parents are

145
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:21,210
embarrassed at first and then they think i'm going to get my kid a tutor and they're going to be as

146
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,789
good as the other kids at reading or writing what they're going to be able to do and i think that's

147
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:30,309
whatever their weakness is that's not going to happen like i tried my whole life to do certain

148
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:37,210
things and it just doesn't go into my head so when you force them to do something they can't

149
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,629
their self-confidence goes down and my boxing coach when i was a kid i was i was having a fight

150
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:51,350
first round this guy was just a thug he was just like flat out swinging and i i'm a competitive

151
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,629
person and i just started swinging back and

152
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:01,649
bit more solid like that's how he fights and jack renny said to me in the corner that's not the way

153
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:06,870
you fight if you fight his fight he's better at that than you and you're going to lose and he said

154
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,009
in order to win in life as well you got to concentrate on what you're good at so i always

155
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:18,629
think of that in life and with these kids if they're good at art let them do art they're going

156
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,809
to do it so much better than everyone else and they find their confidence i want to come back

157
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,769
to your boxing and the great jack renny

158
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:28,850
in your corner that that that explains a little bit i'll talk to you about that in a moment but

159
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,970
i'm gonna go back i look i'm seeing you across from someone who you know if you know that part

160
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,090
of melbourne and you know what you went through the likelihood that one of the world's great

161
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,370
artists is going to emerge out of a tough upbringing in broad meadows might be a trillion

162
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:51,210
to one how do we encourage more artists how do you you're sitting there from this position now

163
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,309
where you've been able to be that one in a billion or a trillion

164
00:13:54,809 --> 00:14:00,149
how do you find the path for more artists to emerge like you have i'm very nervous too by the

165
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:08,330
way you can see my um i knew i could paint and i wanted a way out of the world i was in and

166
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:15,529
it's still a stereotype if you tell someone you're an artist they say what else do you do and people

167
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:22,750
think you can only be successful when you're dead i do watch my back a little bit prices were yeah

168
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,789
paintings will go up um and i think that's a good thing i think that's a good thing i think that's a

169
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:31,649
good thing i think the art world needs to change so if i was to ask generally people to name five

170
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,230
australian artists they can't when you're an artist and you're ambitious people can call you

171
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,629
a sellout a sports person a musician an actor they're allowed to make money they're allowed

172
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:48,970
to be ambitious people celebrate it they can have sponsorships um apply business class look

173
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,629
after their family the art world has to change their way show that art is cool it's an

174
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,350
incredible job you can be entrepreneurial and you can still have integrity and if they teach kids

175
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:06,610
we can show them that you can be successful and it is a way out there's a lot of creative kids out

176
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,129
there that are choosing a different path because they think it's you know i chose crime at one

177
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:16,789
point because i i looked up to these guys and i thought i want to drive a mercedes and and wear

178
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,629
sunglasses and look cool and it's not going to happen in the art world it's a great point you

179
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,649
may i've never thought of you know i don't know your world uh

180
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:29,409
at all well wouldn't pretend to but i think almost like the you actually started your career as a

181
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:35,169
part-time chef it's like the chefs have emerged out of the kitchen into great commercial success

182
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:41,230
and we celebrate those food geniuses now but not in the art world so much when we were at school

183
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:47,610
it was home economics and fancy food and wine people were scared to talk about it like to

184
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,389
articulate what they taste when they're drinking wine now everyone does it everyone's quite

185
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,789
confident and when you start to talk about it you start to talk about it and you start to talk about

186
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,190
art people say oh i don't know anything about art um i can't draw a stick figure but everyone

187
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,629
starts off as an artist like you go to a kid's class and it's just full of art and at some point

188
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,710
they're told you know it's not accurate enough or something but the beauty of i like all art

189
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:19,929
i paint the way i do because that's what comes naturally but art's conceptual and it's about

190
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:24,610
what you see is different to what i see what you've experienced and when we create it it's

191
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:30,629
individual and special so they also need to be taught that abstract art performance art whatever

192
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:38,190
it might be you can still be an artist i think we do need to teach kids um or people you know

193
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,370
look what jamie oliver and matt moran and things are done for the chef world how do we do it for

194
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,590
the art world yeah when you look at your your art and as i said i the genius of it blows me away i

195
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,950
can't even comprehend you doing what you do

196
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:01,269
it's easy but you just you see when you unveil julia gillard's portrait and it's still hanging

197
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:06,210
in parliament house and you can see the look on her face around you captured something in her that

198
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:13,630
other people hadn't seen and um is that connection that you find with people where it starts for you

199
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,710
connection is absolutely everything like you can you can replicate a bad photo you know you could

200
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:24,069
send it overseas somewhere and an art factory and they'll send it back to you and it will look like

201
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,650
the photograph

202
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,849
what matters to me not the traditional way of someone sitting in front of me

203
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:36,470
they're feeling self-conscious and so am i and you know when you spend a bit of time with someone

204
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,190
and you you earn each other's trust and you're genuinely interested and you start to talk about

205
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,609
something that hits home like we were talking earlier before the podcast about kids and sports

206
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:54,789
and parents and i could see the emotion in you coming out that's what i'm talking about

207
00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:00,329
i'm looking for something that's really deep and connected so i spend time it's a bit like big

208
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,670
brother they forget the camera's around and i you know i might be snapping something and listening

209
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,309
um talking to a friend of yours if it was your portrait talking to your family just go and watch

210
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:16,289
you do something and you see movements in people's face their body language their someone says

211
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:22,630
something and my hair stands up and that's the moment i want to catch yeah so i believe you know

212
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,410
not religious uh you know maybe spiritual but a painting of any type or an artwork can have

213
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:36,549
emotion and an energy sometimes people look at an abstract colored patch and they've they feel

214
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:43,130
something you know so yeah no chatting to you i i feel i can sense that and we might come back and

215
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,390
talk kids sport in a moment potentially but i've got to go to 2008 you've got a great friendship

216
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:55,690
with heath ledger who's an incredible actor and human being and and you paint this remarkable

217
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,509
portrait that is award-winning and he says to you at the time this is going to change both of our

218
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:06,650
lives tragically he passed away not long afterwards can you tell us about your friendship with heath

219
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,569
ledger yeah well it's interesting you know what you're just saying about um connection being so

220
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,190
or we were saying about connection being so important i always felt connected to heath

221
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,609
we had a lot of mutual friends and would hang out in groups and we're all young and he had a lot of

222
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:28,829
friends that lived in melbourne from perth he would come and see them i was part of that group

223
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:36,670
sometimes you can know someone for a long time and you're kind of ready for this time or

224
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,710
conversation where things change and you can meet someone for an hour and your friends for life and

225
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,970
you kind of know it and we had this we've been waiting to do this portrait for a long time

226
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,369
and we've been waiting for this portrait for a long time and we've been waiting for this portrait

227
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:53,950
tell me if i'm taking too long just so happened he was in perth for christmas and i i went there as

228
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,150
well and we had this night where everything poured out of us like he told me things he had never

229
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,289
spoken about i told him things not for any reason just started happening i was telling him things he

230
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:14,650
was very complicated guy with a very complicated life and exceptionally talented and confident

231
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,250
vulnerable like just none of it makes sense

232
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:26,029
it was like uh one of the most meaningful nights i've had with someone like a really moving the

233
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,509
next day i turned up at his house seven in the morning something he answered the door in his

234
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:36,990
pajamas and his t-shirt off we hardly spoke and he took a chair outside and he sat on the chair

235
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:44,109
and i wasn't sure if what we were doing and for an awkwardly long time and i pulled my camera

236
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,210
thought this must be it started taking photos i wish i had filmed it

237
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:53,670
sat there for a long time and he just lost himself and i thought he was kind of gone out of his body

238
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,769
and he's staring then he got up like he was still sitting on a chair but another him got up and

239
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:05,549
started screaming roaring at himself and spit was coming out he's yelling at himself about things

240
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:12,990
that we had talked about in his life and um and he stopped and waited a while went around to the

241
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,289
other side and he started laughing and then after a while he started whispering in the other ear

242
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:26,750
and then talking yelling and i just watched it all and i was like fuck like this is like he just let

243
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:32,170
everything out of this silent him and that was how he's feeling about his life does he still trust

244
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,750
the same people do the new people in his life like him for who he is can he share his feelings

245
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:45,150
it's part of why i'm writing about a lot of things and then it stopped i knew this was something

246
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,329
special and i worked like a maniac his dad

247
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:53,390
told me recently that he always thought he wasn't going to be around for a long time

248
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,789
he was very ambitious about the future he didn't take his own life but i feel like he had this

249
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:06,109
feeling and he said it's going to change our lives and um yeah i you know i painted like a

250
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:12,410
maniac and i finished it three weeks later on i sent it to him that night and he passed that night

251
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,869
did you get to see it i don't know if you got to see it um he saw a sketch

252
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:25,089
that i did yeah it's just uh there's been so many strange coincidences since then and you know

253
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:33,569
interestingly his dad said they would have a bit of a headbutt about business decisions kim his

254
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:41,089
father is very business and he's the opposite and he never understood heath well and he said

255
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:45,549
i wish he knew that i now know him better than i ever did when he was around

256
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,990
and you donated that painting to

257
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:55,990
to heath's mom and um i love the process of being out of research or background she donated it to

258
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,210
the to the portrait gallery is that correct no portrait gallery awesome in canberra she

259
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:07,670
donated it after the archibald to the new south wales art gallery i gave it to her and she said

260
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:14,130
i feel selfish keeping it i want somewhere for people to understand heath and go and talk to him

261
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,269
yeah and they're choosing not to put that on the wall at the moment

262
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,349
so shout out to him and he's going to be a great artist and he's going to be a great artist and

263
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:28,210
i'm hoping that um you know she can do something different and it's not about me

264
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:37,210
it's about his family and his friends and people that loved him i and about heath yeah i'm not sure

265
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,390
why it's been in the basement i feel grateful from what i got from the archibald from the gallery i

266
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,009
just don't understand that decision i mean i shouldn't harp on this but perhaps if they don't

267
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,349
want to show up i'm not going to show up i'm not going to show up i'm not going to show up i'm not

268
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:52,710
maybe it could be shown somewhere else is that a possibility it's such an iconic thing that

269
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,470
it's been created it's yeah heath's family offered to buy it back they didn't even they

270
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,089
donated but they offered to buy it back hang it somewhere else um shout out to the gallery

271
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:09,109
hang the painting give it back sounds like in the art world that there is more politics than

272
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:13,390
it seems that there's is that something that's been difficult for you to bang that door down and

273
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,250
try and be the person you want to be in in a world that seems fairly hierarchical

274
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:24,950
full of politics um there's a lot of wankery in the art world there's also a lot of amazing people

275
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,369
and very generous people as well like art's given me everything i have and the art world's part of

276
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:36,349
that i try to get rid of the chip on my shoulder because i like to stay positive there's it

277
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:42,589
definitely needs to change it's very hard for young people to feel accepted you know like you

278
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:46,630
go into a white walled gallery and you know you're not buying an artwork and no one will talk to you

279
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,349
i had people laugh in my face

280
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:55,410
handing in my resume or my portfolio or something the music world's changed acting the art world's

281
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,890
still very closed doors to a lot of people i love that i'm sitting across from someone who's got a

282
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,069
master's in fine art from one of the world's leading i'm a professor as well really let's

283
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:12,490
not undersell you my apologies but who literally can't read or write and still struggles to

284
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:18,329
understand with the learning difficulties that you've got is that something that you've had to

285
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:23,470
force that down beyond all the hurdles that are there should we be able to open up those

286
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:29,410
opportunities more for young people with learning challenges yeah art's a visual language um and i

287
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:36,289
i really appreciate art history i love that people can defend their art or articulate art really well

288
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,470
i can't do that i can do it with you know do it with my mates i'll talk about art i like it i

289
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,930
don't i describe it the best i can it's not necessary you also have to go you have to finish

290
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:54,029
school do your 12 saying that i think school is very important not the academic side necessarily

291
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:59,490
because it's not for everyone but the social side and social development of young people

292
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:08,150
so it's about key points in their life you know they're formal they're hanging out like you end

293
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,410
the year together and you celebrate and you go away somewhere all these different things

294
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,690
that socially need to develop in kids and if they're not academic they leave and they miss out

295
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:25,309
and they turn into adults too fast you also need to finish high school to get into a university

296
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:31,750
and maybe the best artists out there can't finish high school or they should be able to finish high

297
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:39,849
school and they would but they kind of can't so you know if a kid can't do history in university

298
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:46,769
should they not be allowed to have a degree in art we all are born different

299
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:55,589
as we grow the experiences we have developed into outlooks uniquely our own

300
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:58,869
charting our life's course

301
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:08,950
no one sees an idea opinion or opportunity like you and no one sees you like v u

302
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:16,990
victoria university uniquely you my name is you i study uh territory preparation

303
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:22,950
i was born in iraq we had to move from iraq when i was six years old because of the war

304
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,509
when we went to jordan we just applied for a visa to come to australia thank god we got it and we

305
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:34,390
came here and i'm loving this offer so the course on studying gives me the opportunity to study

306
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,190
many other pathways and it gives me the opportunity to choose whatever i want it opens so many places

307
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,549
for me at elita our signature program elita connect is something we're really passionate and

308
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:48,349
proud of we bring together groups of five to six people from all over the world to work together to

309
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:53,470
six people around the globe from diverse backgrounds sport industry social venture and the

310
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,509
arts and come together to learn to connect and to collaborate liz ellis australian netball icon

311
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:04,529
and television presenter the thing that i've loved about it is not just the meetings that we have

312
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:09,230
with our group it's the thinking that you do the days and days afterwards someone says something

313
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,950
and it sparks a thought and within my sport and within women's sport i'm just someone who

314
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,410
i try to lead by keeping people talking about the issues

315
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,150
there's times when i think the person i'm trying to convince is not listening to me

316
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,569
it actually got me thinking about this is how i need to address my communication with them so it

317
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:32,009
was i can't tell you how much i enjoyed it you showed me a moment ago a portrait you did recently

318
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:39,789
of alex pereros a usc brazilian martial artist of the highest order and we were talking about

319
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,230
but a usc i've got three boys who love that sport for everyone as you as you said but

320
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,509
you're a you're a passionate boxer

321
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,150
i'm told incredibly capable tell us about that part of your life and did you ever think about

322
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,269
doing that seriously oh that was my dream growing up kids need a bit of support i got that through

323
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:04,269
jack renny he let me sweep the gym train for free i thought that was going to be my way out

324
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:09,130
i i didn't lose a boxing fight i did i did well i had lots of amateur fights kickboxing fights

325
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,930
jack at one point i'll get to that later uh let's go back to the question say it one more time

326
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,390
now i'm lost mate i i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost

327
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,609
what jack renny said to you i'm gonna keep you going i'll tell you what jack said i was training

328
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:30,829
very hard i finally found someone i never had any boundaries and yeah it makes a kid feel like

329
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,849
no you you want boundaries you don't want to ask for them because you're trying to be a rebel

330
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:41,289
jack was the first guy to set boundaries for me if you fuck up you get into fights if you're ever

331
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:47,250
a bully if you do drugs you're not training at this gym and uh it actually yeah i've

332
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,529
i hear his voice and it makes me emotional and i think of kids that don't have it

333
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,490
i also think of kids that get pushed too hard by their parents we were talking about

334
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,369
if someone has a dream they're gonna give every part of themselves you don't you don't have to

335
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:09,130
force them you just have to support them and i wasn't getting that support i got it from jack

336
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,829
but i wanted to thank jack so i did this sketch no one knew i could draw um i did a sketch of

337
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,390
lionel rose and johnny famijan i gave it to jack and i gave it to jack and i gave it to jack and i

338
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:25,609
gave it to jack and he um he he was in tears i never said he was that's not jack and uh he said

339
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:34,150
something like uh have a drink of water make a joke always helps um he said i know you're going

340
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,089
to be okay and then he said the next day this is the funny part slightly insulting slightly

341
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:45,490
complimentary he said i reckon you should be an artist not a boxer and it wasn't because i was

342
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,690
quite the opposite i found out recently that jack was actually um very passionate artist himself

343
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:58,029
his son rang me up after the book after australian story and said you wouldn't believe how much of

344
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:04,410
what you said uh was accurate about jack and he was also a passionate secret artist so it kind of

345
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,029
makes sense as well i just can see the amazing emotion you've got that jack runny's changed your

346
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:14,950
life and boxing gets a bad rap for not understanding that some of those gyms really

347
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,390
saved a lot of kids for exactly the way you described it

348
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,289
here's some you muck up you're out here's some boundaries for the first time in your life and

349
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,150
we before we started we i don't know how we did but we started getting onto spot asked how your

350
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,930
boys were and what they're into and they're passionate about soccer and it did jump off

351
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,609
this passion topic of mine being around junior sport and as you said really brilliantly just

352
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:42,029
then i just see parents that just they're ruining that beautiful environment because

353
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,890
it's a void in themselves they want to live vicariously through their kids

354
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,390
and

355
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:53,670
they're taking the joy away from kids and under agassi story yeah example and you're seeing that

356
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,269
as well and absolutely you can see kids get uh yelled out in their car park by their parents

357
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:05,769
this is what i'm talking about tough upbringing it could be it could be that like what's her name

358
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:12,710
australian female tennis player champion elena yep terrible father like that's that's a terrible

359
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,289
torporous upbringing and you know it's it's

360
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:23,390
so sad that she might have been more amazing and actually enjoyed herself i think it's like you

361
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,309
you know you don't let your kid have sugar their whole life and when they can they're having sugar

362
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:34,150
drugs and they're pregnant you know it's you can't control someone you know and a lot of parents are

363
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:41,910
trying to force their kid to live their dream it happens in the acting world happens in probably

364
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:47,170
in art as well but i think people push art less because there's not the fun i wonder

365
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:55,690
yeah i wonder sometimes if the parents want the celebrity that you look at some famous athletes

366
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,430
for example and their parents are in the light too you know and i wonder if they're chasing all of

367
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,269
that through their kids or you know a youtube kid you know they're not doing it themselves

368
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:12,950
the parents are yeah it's just a child abuse how do you approach being a dad to your two boys

369
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,390
back to a seinfeld reference when george decided to be a dad to his two boys

370
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:23,109
to do everything the opposite to how he thought he should he was successful i do everything the

371
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:29,650
opposite to kind of what i was shown when i was a kid um by choice i always think there's a way

372
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:38,130
i believe the cycle doesn't have to continue and success to me before anything else is when my boys

373
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:45,369
are adults and someone asks them about their dad they say that they were loved and you know and

374
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:47,390
they love me back so when it

375
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:54,730
comes to sports or anything they're doing i say whatever effort you put in i'll put in just as

376
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,410
much you know you want to train 45 minutes away all right i feel like i'm gonna be there too

377
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:07,650
that happens and also emotionally sports psychology is so important i remember i turned

378
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,570
up to a boxing match and i was worried about not the guy with tats and look tough nothing wrong

379
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,389
with tats by the way um i was worried about the kid that

380
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,869
turned up with a sports bag and their dad and i knew they had the support they had the psychology

381
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:31,010
and i was one i was envious of it and now i have so many stories like meeting oscar piastri recently

382
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,989
young kid i did his portrait he's just a kid and he has the weight of the world on his shoulders

383
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:44,289
especially in australia and he's so focused he's very strong and i think he'll be world champion

384
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:47,050
but i just saw this kid you know

385
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:53,909
and he's a kid he's 22 that's yeah he's still a baby yeah a billion dollars yeah it's worldwide

386
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:02,789
fans it's his country that's that's a lot yeah and he's good though he and he travels with his

387
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:08,510
um i know you'll call us sports psychology she was amazing spoke to her it's so important and

388
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,449
a lot of people don't have it and kids have the opposite they have someone busting their balls

389
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:16,730
it might not even be their dream yeah no i was sharing with you before and i

390
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,389
have no idea what you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what

391
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:17,429
you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about

392
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,670
mentioned this before on the podcast this this idea of the conversation in the car and how

393
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,690
it ruins sport for many kids because they love it kids just love it and under 13 grand final

394
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,969
if they win it or they lose it five minutes the kids are over it the parents are the ones

395
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:35,530
this is the biggest thing in my life and they you get in the car all the kid wants you to say to

396
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,050
them is i love watching you play it's all you need to say yeah nothing else and i i remind myself

397
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,690
with that all the time still we just love watching you play but when we add all these other layers

398
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:52,869
why didn't you yeah you just ruin sport you know you ruin so many things for kids and if it's their

399
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:59,610
dream they will they're gonna feel like my my boy gets in the car and i hope you don't mind me

400
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:06,050
talking about you luca he gets in the car and he he's so passionate i think i really believe in the

401
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:12,989
dream and i'd like to get your opinion my 10 year old said to me the other day dad hard work beats

402
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:17,389
talent if talent doesn't work hard enough and i was like wow son that's amazing

403
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:23,090
where'd you get left from he said you told me years ago but i think it was ron barassi told me

404
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:31,550
that and did you paint ron i did yeah and really wise words from him also about teams and sports

405
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:38,610
and as a coach he said you're not coaching that just their performance you've got to think about

406
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,309
why they're not performing what's happening in their private life some people you need to yell

407
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,969
and some people need a hug you know it's it's you would know

408
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:47,389
my

409
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:53,449
more than i would but it's a big responsibility as a coach um and if you have a parent doing the

410
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:59,349
opposite it's tough especially when they're kids and it's a safe haven should be for everyone but

411
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,690
it hasn't always been the case so i love the opportunity to sit down and

412
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,289
the diverse uh thinking and your life story is so unique we have this sort of saying in our world

413
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:13,909
that success leaves clues and they're these patterns around why people even from the most

414
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,389
diverse backgrounds have success this idea that you've got to fill your own

415
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:23,070
cup up first before you can be good for anyone else so what do you do that makes you be at your

416
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:29,630
best for yourself so that you can be good for others i have the most incredible friends and

417
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:37,489
family you know i've created a family for myself through my friends as well um and that's just i

good school but i think it's uh just having good positive people like me for who i am and

434
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:22,610
no one there wants anything from each other my family doesn't want anything from me i like people

435
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:30,829
that connect because they like the person this is the one piece of advice that you've consistently

436
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:37,030
passed on in all the success that you've had find it might not even be what you're good at

437
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,869
but hopefully you are but find what you're passionate about and then every day is going

438
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:47,389
to be positive and successful and you'll probably fly um you know we're here for you

439
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:54,349
i get taught this lesson all the time michael godinski heath other friends like life can be

440
00:39:54,349 --> 00:40:00,949
cut short you know someone like neil denneher just blows my mind with positivity surround

441
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:06,210
yourself with positive people and make your life and your work about something you're passionate

442
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:12,690
about pretty solid advice that the vision of what you do is is unique i'm assuming there's a

443
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,389
a team behind that as well that help you bring that vision to life how do you

444
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:23,789
share your unique view of the world to make that come together i i've listened to a lot of books

445
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:30,170
because i'm because of my um not being able to read and one of them was years and years ago

446
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:37,110
richard branson who's also dyslexic saying to be successful in life and business you need to know

447
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:42,949
what you're not good at and let your ego not in these words but let go of your ego and find

448
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:46,949
and allow people to do what you're not good at and don't micromanage

449
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:53,730
them so i'm not good at many many things and you know i've found people that can help me

450
00:40:53,730 --> 00:41:00,090
and let them do what they're good at and i'll do what i am good at so people are inherently curious

451
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:05,909
who have success like you can you tell us how curiosity shows up for you and is there different

452
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:12,130
rabbit holes that your curiosity takes you down so this is another big deal for people that really

453
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,030
have strong adhd we can concentrate obsessively

454
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:26,190
for 15 hours i can i can get done when i'm in the zone not trying to brag but i could get two weeks

455
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:33,650
of what other people could do done in 15 hours and this is part of the gift but can i just jump on

456
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,829
that for a second sorry to interrupt you but so you've you've taken this and you can just paint

457
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:45,710
for 15 hours and it's and nothing else matters in that time i won't even stop to eat um i'll be

458
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,389
dehydrated i'll have my music on and i'll be in the zone and i'll be in the zone for 15 hours

459
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:54,050
i'll be dancing i'll be painting and having the best time in my life and the only thing that stops

460
00:41:54,050 --> 00:42:02,050
me is absolute exhaustion and you're just on a roll it's like i i'm looking at this painting

461
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:08,869
come alive and i'm it's like this it's like drugs you can also have a fall from that as well but

462
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:17,030
with adhd and things like that you can also i'm very aware if i'm in the concentration zone i

463
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:24,329
have my art in front of me you can get in that zone on the internet you can get in that zone

464
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:29,469
you have a new little interest and you just become obsessed and time just disappears and

465
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:34,769
this is what happens to kids or adults that aren't aware of it you know next thing you know

466
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:41,469
you're a gaming dad that sits in the garage i don't do gaming but you know that you can fall

467
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:46,269
into these negative rabbit holes or positive i love cooking i might become obsessed i'm cooking

468
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:47,389
you know every single day i'm cooking i'm cooking i'm cooking i'm cooking i'm cooking i'm cooking

469
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:50,170
and they're like can you stop cooking this stuff and i have to get it right

470
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:57,750
um i've been trying to figure out forever i love people and i love success not just

471
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:05,110
celebrity of money or i just like successful people that are achieving great things game

472
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,809
changes and and i'm trying to figure out and you're probably doing the same what is it that

473
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:16,530
they all have in common often it's that they are passionate about it i haven't figured it out yet

474
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,369
have you figured it out

475
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:22,070
i'm figuring it out through you today and that's that's exactly what you picked up on is this

476
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:27,489
pattern around and and we see the patterns isn't it from an i need to know the the recipe for

477
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:33,230
coca-cola you know it's like and i think we see these these are being some of the common things

478
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,789
the next one i ask you about is this idea of collaboration i love this idea that the sort

479
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:45,550
of cost of great leadership is time and that to still be able to spend 15 hours on a panic as you

480
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,389
can but also to have a

481
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:53,230
family and make life function at the same time how do you make all that work well this makes me

482
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:59,230
think again a friend of mine uh larry kesselman very successful um lucky enough to have larry on

483
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:05,289
the podcast and oh really yes incredible uh so we're working together now so larry's helping me

484
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:11,190
with business and i'm sticking to the creative stuff we have nothing to gain from each other

485
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,349
except for the adventure of maybe changing the game a little bit like we talked about like the

486
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:16,929
chefs have done

487
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:23,190
nice to have that support he said to me extraordinary people put an extraordinary

488
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,550
effort most kids will be training three days a week there's a kid that's training

489
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:34,170
seven days a week not because he's forced to but you have to make sacrifices you know i watched

490
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:41,469
that david beckham doco and he looks like a big beautiful star and he was in bed early he was the

491
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:47,130
first one at training last one to leave all of that um you know obsessive wasn't it when you

492
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:55,349
that yeah what i what makes me scared of that is this balanced situation where i know i could paint

493
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,269
more but then my kids wouldn't know who i am yeah but then there is someone that's painting more and

494
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:04,429
they might be more successful and i'm competitive and i think oh well if i'm going to be able to do

495
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:11,010
that i need to do what the other person is doing i look at a lot of people very successful not all

496
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,170
of them and a lot of people that fall by the wayside in their lives and you know picasso

497
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,389
suicides all over the place and i'm like oh my god i'm not gonna be able to do that i'm not gonna be

498
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:23,309
and you know whatever tennis player has a good relationship with his family and we all love him

499
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:32,909
but they his kids might be falling to pieces so i um i also struggle with how do i push to the limit

500
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:39,349
of what fills my bucket there but also what's more important with my family and my friends

501
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:45,230
it's a great question isn't it and i ask that of myself all the time and other people around

502
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,389
what your definition of success means isn't it

503
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:54,670
and what does it mean to you it's i love you asher my kids i want them to say the same thing

504
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:59,769
about both of us and luca's mom as well you know i want them to say they were loved that i was a

505
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:05,449
good dad and that's why they're the great people that i hope they will be i don't want to we're

506
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:10,909
all going to fuck it up um michael godinski always said to me don't fuck it up a lot of

507
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:17,369
people say it to me for some reason um but i i don't want to fuck it up so you know i want to

508
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:26,090
inspire people to be artists to be successful but i don't want it not at any cost to my family

509
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:31,610
so success to me is finding this balance one of the great people michael godinski

510
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:37,929
anyone else the the next to me i want to talk to you about which i'm really fascinated to ask is

511
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:44,110
about the way people communicate is something they're pretty um clear on for the success they

512
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,389
have the traditional way of communicating for you reading and writing is that you're not just

513
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:52,329
writing has not been available to you by the sounds of it and and the challenge you've had

514
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:56,750
but even spending a little bit of time with you and having a coffee a minute ago you've got this

515
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:03,190
incredible way of almost instant connection and can you describe how that is is that something

516
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,650
you think about or i think we just bromance we just have an instant uh connection you know and

517
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:16,369
i i notice those things and i feel uh really grateful when they happen i'm very open to you

518
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:17,389
know some people say oh i have an

519
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:23,050
uh friends you know but then you might miss out on something really special in your life

520
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:30,230
you know and i remind myself not to judge as well you can meet someone on a day and it's not the day

521
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:37,050
and you judge them and you might you might miss out you know someone's dog died you know they're

522
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,710
having a bad day they're not going to be the friendly guy they normally would girl whatever

523
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:46,750
it is i try and give myself and other people chances

524
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:52,630
whom i'd say give someone a chance like i love people and i want to learn about them and i'm very

525
00:47:52,630 --> 00:48:00,170
open to you know what i can learn i just love learning and meeting people is the best way to

526
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:11,090
learn vincent who's been the greatest leader in your life i could just run a whole list i have

527
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,369
such incredible friends i don't want to i don't want to not tell one of the good leaders in my

528
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:17,389
life i don't want to tell one of the good leaders in my life i don't want to tell one of the good leaders

529
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:24,469
in my life you know there's people like larry or mates like you know nick williams just people that

530
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:30,809
are there for me and i learned something from them but neil danaher um you know we had a very

531
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:37,889
special connection when you did neil's portrait yeah so the i now know uh more than ever about

532
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:43,849
footy i didn't grow up with it so i had no idea i didn't have a team my whole life asher is mad

533
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:47,369
about collingwood and i'm sorry even though she's got a massive hawthorne connection

534
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:54,889
yes her uncle was a bob ketty um i didn't know about football i only met neil for who he was

535
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:59,969
and when someone introduced us and i thought uh you know i feel people's energies and i was a

536
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:06,150
little bit worried about going to see him because he's not well and it's you know not worried i just

537
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:13,329
knew that i would feel it not at all i left there thinking i could take the world on and i don't

538
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:17,329
know what he was as a coach before you know as a person i don't know what he was as a person

539
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:24,369
i just know this guy in front of me and unlikely friends you know and i knew he liked me and i

540
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:32,690
liked him back and um yeah every time i see him i leave it's so it's weird i just think i can do

541
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:40,050
anything recently he asked asher and i to do he's doing a new campaign for a tv ad and he doesn't

542
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:45,329
necessarily like the crowds and all the people you know he has a lot of it and he was pretty quiet

543
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,309
that day and a lot of people

544
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:50,670
around i always give him a bit of shit and he gives me shit but he's got a very funny dark

545
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:56,570
sense of humor he can't speak so he looks at ipad and his eyes move and it says something

546
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:02,469
but he hadn't said much i made some crack at him i was walking off thinking i was cool he goes

547
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:07,329
that means hey hold on so everyone turns and they're all listening there's a whole crowd of

548
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:16,250
people and he's typing and then he says your hair looks shit house and it's just you know it's just

549
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,309
like i just love

550
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:23,550
that all this stuff going on in the world and he's cracking a joke is you know he might be the

551
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,750
most inspirational person i've ever been yeah company of and that yeah the fighting the beast

552
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:35,170
that he has and and that still have that humor and make you feel good when he was really supposed to

553
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:40,829
not live more than a year and he's 10 years on 11 years on raised 100 million dollars for disease

554
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:46,550
that no one survived long enough to and yet he has that impact uh you just want to be a better

555
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,309
person when you're around him and he's got a lot of humor and he's got a lot of humor and he's got

556
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:51,949
a lot of derp around neil denna don't you listen and he but he also just send me a text saying how

557
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:59,230
you doing yeah yeah random yes special amazing human being we're a bit obsessed vince with this

558
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:04,289
idea of collaboration and i look at all your work is effectively collaboration isn't it whether it's

559
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:11,309
painting michael godinski or neil danaher or this you know what we're doing yeah it's it's it's

560
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:16,789
everywhere has there been in any of your passions you thought god that's the one person and i'd love

561
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:18,610
Is there a name that comes to mind?

562
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,989
I've had great collaborators.

563
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:26,110
I've done a lot of work with Baz Luhrmann, Matt Moran.

564
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:28,949
I haven't even spoken about someone like Matt Moran.

565
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:33,510
He's like a brother, godfather to my kids, always giving me good advice.

566
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,789
He's a great leader to me as well.

567
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:40,269
The painting of Heath wouldn't be what it was unless it was a collaboration.

568
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,190
I love the visual language.

569
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,530
I would love to collaborate with a filmmaker and make a film.

570
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,130
I'm not sure I have a few friends in mind.

571
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:52,949
Yeah, but I want to tell a story.

572
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,929
Every night, I don't know about you or people listening, I don't sleep much,

573
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,710
but I dream so much.

574
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:04,650
It's exhausting, like epic films.

575
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,389
I see the lighting.

576
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,590
I can smell it.

577
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:07,989
I can hear.

578
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:10,769
I have dialogue that I couldn't come up with myself.

579
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,510
I'm like, fuck, I'm not that smart, and it's in my dream.

580
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,210
Do you remember it?

581
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:15,809
I have so many ideas.

582
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,190
I remember a lot of it, yeah.

583
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,309
I watch good films every night.

584
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,909
I'm exhausted when I wake up, but I want to share some of the stories.

585
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:30,030
Yeah, so taking the art creativity to the screen.

586
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,429
Comedy.

587
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:31,190
No, I'm just kidding.

588
00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:35,750
Vincent, I could talk to you for another two hours.

589
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,269
It's such a fascinating thing to sit down.

590
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,510
I have a lot of questions for you.

591
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,949
Maybe one day we flip it and I podcast you.

592
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:44,969
And it would be far less interesting.

593
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,190
I promise you than this.

594
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:51,230
For those that, if you haven't had a chance, go and buy Unveiled.

595
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:55,309
It's an extraordinary piece of work, an amazing life story.

596
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:56,050
It's not a piece of work.

597
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,030
It's your life story, and it's remarkable.

598
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:58,789
I'm a piece of work.

599
00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:01,650
It sounded a bit like that, didn't it, as I said that?

600
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,989
I encourage you to go and read it, buy it,

601
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,670
and if you haven't caught up with some of the geniuses of Vincent Fantuzo,

602
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:09,250
it's a great pleasure to spend some time with you.

603
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:10,070
Look, thanks heaps.
