1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Today's conversation is without question the most heartbreaking and powerful conversation

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,860
I've ever had.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,460
Wayne Holdsworth, as a father and husband, wants to share his story.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,080
It's one I think everyone needs to listen to.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,059
We know conversations like this may be triggering and difficult for many people.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:24,100
There is help available, headspace.org.au or call Lifeline on 13 1114.

7
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,490
I got a call from Scott Pape, the Barefoot Investor, who I consider a friend.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,490
I've been lucky enough to chat to him in this forum on a couple of occasions.

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,329
He's very kind-hearted, empathetic and full of integrity.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,909
He rang me and he said, I've heard the most heartbreaking story ever.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,109
He said, I'm writing about it in my column today.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,890
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to write about.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,609
And he went on to tell me of a 16-year-old boy in our community, as he described, happy,

14
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,369
healthy, captain of his footy team, who had taken his own life after being extorted on

15
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:57,829
the internet.

16
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,490
And he said to me, I know this is going to break your heart as well as a father of four.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,490
He comes from...

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,689
a great family.

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,689
And I'd love you to meet his dad, Wayne Holdsworth.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,969
Wayne, I'm sitting across from you today on the back of that conversation.

21
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,189
I can't express enough sympathy or empathy for what you and your family have gone through.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,689
I can't imagine walking in your shoes at all.

23
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,390
But I know you're incredibly passionate about trying to protect someone else's family from

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,950
this happening to you and you want to tell the story.

25
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:25,849
Can you share it with us?

26
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:26,969
Yeah, I will, Luke.

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,969
And thank you very much for having me today.

28
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,709
It's really important that we share the messages that are important.

29
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:39,810
Yeah, back on October 24th, last year, 2023, my 17-year-old son then, he took his own life.

30
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,590
He took his own life at home and it was very early in the morning when I discovered him.

31
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,609
Unfortunately, he had hung himself and the only other person in the house at that point,

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,189
my wife had already gone to work, was my 15-year-old daughter.

33
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:02,370
And so to discover him and then to scream and then to try to manage a situation,

34
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,030
without my young daughter being affected by seeing him, was really confronting.

35
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,090
The grief, the sorrow, the helplessness, the blame, all those feelings just combined into one.

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,289
And, you know, I often talk about this, that, you know, when you're growing up as a young boy,

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,050
you often look to your mum or dad for guidance with regards to values and process and procedures

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,030
to run your life.

39
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,610
But there's no book as to how to find your son when they've just taken their own life.

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,469
And so you've got to find your son.

41
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:37,330
Flying by the seat of your pants, I laid him down after cutting him down

42
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,509
and my tears were dropping on his face.

43
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:44,710
He was cold and he was rigid and his face had changed colour totally.

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,030
And then to have to lay him down and then my daughter said they're on the phone now

45
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,770
and I grabbed the phone and asked her to stay there.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,449
That whole process sticks with me every day.

47
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,449
And fortunately for me, Luke, I was connected with a group called Support Up.

48
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:11,050
And they gave me the tools, strength and resilience to be able to get through the funeral.

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,830
There was 700 at his funeral, which was quite a big funeral.

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,569
Then getting through that, getting back to work straight away, which is important to me.

51
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,069
I run basketball on the peninsula.

52
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,689
And then getting through Christmas was really difficult for the first time.

53
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,650
And I'm not only managing my feelings, but I'm managing my whole family as leader of the family.

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,870
You know, I have a 15-year-old, I have a 20-year-old and my oldest son is 30.

55
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,949
And when he heard the news, when I called him that morning, he runs a gym, Luke,

56
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,370
and he fell to the ground and just crawled up in a ball.

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,310
And so after Christmas, I thought to myself, there's three things that I can do.

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,409
I can take my own life and I did have suicidal thoughts leading up to that period.

59
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,110
I didn't think life was worth it.

60
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,250
The second thing was to just live the shell of the person that I wanted to be

61
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,590
and just go through life.

62
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,110
As a zombie, so to speak.

63
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,650
Well, the third thing was to use Max's death as a catalyst for change.

64
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,389
And so I chose the third thing.

65
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,629
And one thing that has always stuck in my mind,

66
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,230
and I've always worked in sport and administration,

67
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,970
is that things have changed in life.

68
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,629
Back in the 80s, expectations of men and women were different.

69
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,569
Community standards were different.

70
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,050
And if I use the AFL as an example,

71
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,230
they're leaders in the field of setting agenda,

72
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:32,670
for good people.

73
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,910
And one of the things I learned from them is that I had to evolve as a person.

74
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,589
I had to start to reconnect with people and to be able to listen better.

75
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:49,110
And so I talked to many experts in the field in mental health.

76
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,449
I call it mental fitness now because mental health is such a stigma.

77
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,649
And spoke to people in South Australia and New South Wales

78
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:57,889
that have got and developed some programs

79
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,410
that have been cutting edge that are making a difference.

80
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,629
Because unfortunately,

81
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,329
whether we like it or not,

82
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,649
here in Victoria and where I work down at Frankston,

83
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,269
there's a five-week waiting list at Headspace.

84
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,490
And so I know through research that if kids are feeling a certain way

85
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,850
and are struggling five weeks is a long period,

86
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,069
chances are they'll take their own life or do something, harm themselves.

87
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,509
I also know that 80% of the people that present to hospital

88
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,089
attempting to take their own life

89
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,610
end back there doing anything.

90
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,810
And again, or taking their own life.

91
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,269
So as a response to that, I said, enough is enough.

92
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,569
And I know it's a phrase used by many, but it is.

93
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:46,350
We have to educate everybody to be better friends,

94
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,870
to recognize the signs that I've been trained in now,

95
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,329
and to ensure that you've got really good listening skills.

96
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,129
And Luke, if I'd known what I know now back on the 23rd of October,

97
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,610
I wouldn't be here today.

98
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,949
I'd have my son, and I'd be watching him playing footy on Sunday.

99
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,629
It breaks your heart, mate.

100
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,910
I just can't even get the words out, mate, to understand.

101
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,529
The courage to take path three is remarkable, and it does.

102
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,230
You think of your own family, mate, in that light.

103
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,730
And I think the detail's hard to listen to

104
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,629
because we were told for so long not to talk about these things.

105
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,610
And you know now the evidence is we have to.

106
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,129
Yeah.

107
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,009
That's why you're here,

108
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:31,490
to share this with your family.

109
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,509
Yeah.

110
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:31,610
Yeah.

111
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,209
To share this conversation so families listen.

112
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,389
So I talked to my 17 and 13-year-old last night,

113
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,670
and I said, this is what I'm doing today.

114
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,829
This is the story of Mac.

115
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,089
This is what happened to him.

116
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,829
And I think probably worth giving some more detail.

117
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,550
He's 16.

118
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,209
He's living a happy life.

119
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:45,990
He's on Snapchat.

120
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,029
Gets a message from what appears to be a teenage girl.

121
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,649
This is happening every single day.

122
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,470
And he did what every parent hopes.

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,389
He came to you and said, Dad, I'm in trouble.

124
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,810
Yeah.

125
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,810
That's right, Luke.

126
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,889
That's exactly what happened.

127
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,889
He spent a lot of time after work,

128
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:06,889
or after footy training, in his room, on these mediums.

129
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,910
And one night, he had someone make contact with him

130
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,170
that he thought was a young girl.

131
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,310
And I've seen the photos of that young girl,

132
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,589
and she looked about 20.

133
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,990
And she eventually exposed herself and said to Mac,

134
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,610
oh, you play footy.

135
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,569
You must have abs.

136
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,069
Can you show me what you've got?

137
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:30,870
And he didn't.

138
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:31,110
He did.

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,230
Then she said, that's great.

140
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,829
Can I now see your face and full body?

141
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,670
And he shared that picture with whom he thought

142
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,870
was a young lady on the internet.

143
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,329
And this all occurred in 30 minutes.

144
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:48,209
So he was on the internet.

145
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,910
He was befriended.

146
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,009
And he was using Instagram and Snapchat,

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,870
as well as a couple of other programs.

148
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,870
And then the first...

149
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,449
The phone rang, and he picked the phone up.

150
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,550
And it was a middle-aged man.

151
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,149
He turned out to be from Liverpool, New South Wales.

152
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,029
And he was a money mule for a cartel in Russia.

153
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,310
And he said to Mac, I now have your photos.

154
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,810
I've hacked into your account, your Instagram account.

155
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,269
Here are some of the addresses.

156
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,569
And he was right.

157
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,470
He had...

158
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,629
Mac was a bit naive with social media.

159
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,930
And he said, if you do not give me $500,

160
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,889
I'm going to share these pictures.

161
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm going to share these pictures.

162
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,730
And he gave Mac a bank account.

163
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,210
And Mac immediately sent the $500 to him,

164
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,470
which is a mistake.

165
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,450
He shouldn't have done that.

166
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,669
About five minutes after that, the phone rang again.

167
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,110
And it was the guy.

168
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,210
And he said, I've got the $500.

169
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,350
I want another $500.

170
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,549
And if you do not pay me the $500,

171
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,129
your parents will be embarrassed.

172
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,570
They will hate you.

173
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,549
Your friends will see you.

174
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,730
And you will want to kill yourself.

175
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,830
So Mac came rushing into me.

176
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,669
And he said, Dad, can we go into the kitchen?

177
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,429
I said, yeah, because my wife was there.

178
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,529
He said, Dad, I've made a mistake.

179
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,509
And he told me.

180
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,429
I said, mate, you've made no mistake.

181
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,909
And I put my arms around him.

182
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,509
And I had this anger in me, Luke,

183
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,049
that I'd like to rip this guy's throat out.

184
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,230
I was really angry because he told me what had happened.

185
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,490
And he was starting to...

186
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,350
He was really resilient.

187
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,730
He was in and under.

188
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,070
Football is really tough.

189
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,830
And he started getting a little bit emotional.

190
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,470
And I said, I'm with you, mate.

191
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,029
We'll sort this out.

192
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,490
And the phone rang again.

193
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,809
And I said, give it to me.

194
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,409
And he handed it to me.

195
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,990
And he said that I want $500.

196
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,049
And I said, well, I am Senior Detective Holdsworth

197
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,610
from the Mornington Police Station.

198
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,070
And I have your number.

199
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,610
And he said, I don't care.

200
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,330
I hope your son dies.

201
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,450
And I hope you die.

202
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,830
And at that point, I hung up.

203
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,309
I couldn't control that anymore.

204
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,870
So we went to the police.

205
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,710
Luke, we went to the police immediately.

206
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,570
And I said, Mac, are you OK to share this stuff?

207
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,629
And he said, as long as you don't see the pictures, Dad, of course.

208
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,509
Because I said, this guy's committed a really serious crime.

209
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,570
And we went to the Mornington Police.

210
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,370
And they were terrific, really supportive.

211
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,149
And they endorsed what I was saying about him being the victim.

212
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,429
Because Mac was embarrassed by it.

213
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,590
So the police said, we'll take down the details.

214
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,789
But there is no chance we're going to catch this guy.

215
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,110
He'll be a money mule.

216
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,389
And the bank account details will be from overseas.

217
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,549
And we can't trace it.

218
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,429
But we'll take down your details, et cetera.

219
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:39,350
And the statement.

220
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,929
Well, about three days later, I got a call.

221
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,970
And they said, we'd found him.

222
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,830
And I was elated.

223
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,610
And I said, how did you do that?

224
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,409
And he said, this money mule decided to cut out the cartel

225
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,129
and use his own bank account details.

226
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,409
And they were able to trace it.

227
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,090
And so they picked him up.

228
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:00,809
He was also on.

229
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,190
He had some drug charges as well.

230
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,549
And they charged him.

231
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,690
And then last January 2024, his case was heard.

232
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,309
Mac was asked to give a victim impact statement.

233
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,450
But all this got too much for him, Luke.

234
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,690
And he couldn't do it.

235
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,129
And I wrote one.

236
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:26,429
And I went to Liverpool in January 17th, I think it was.

237
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,669
I went there.

238
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,230
And with the full intention of reading this out,

239
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,590
the magistrate didn't allow it

240
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,269
because the accused decided with the prosecution and the defense

241
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,490
that he plead guilty to a lesser offense

242
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,669
of receiving the proceeds of crime.

243
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,789
And therefore, my statement wasn't valid.

244
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,250
And he received six months, of which he'd already served three.

245
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,549
He was already in for three months.

246
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:53,730
So he's out.

247
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,529
He was out in March or April.

248
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,210
And Luke, I have no doubt.

249
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,009
He showed no remorse.

250
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,210
In fact, when he was asked,

251
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,429
how do you plead?

252
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,490
He said, I plead guilty, but I'm the victim.

253
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:09,110
And so he's now on the streets now.

254
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,610
So I say to every parent out there, Luke, every parent,

255
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,049
that if your son or daughter falls into this trap,

256
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,429
don't give them any money.

257
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,629
Often they're bluffing and they haven't got the addresses.

258
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,230
In Mac's case, they did.

259
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,490
But take them on.

260
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,429
Yeah, the anger levels, mate, are off the charts.

261
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:30,210
I can't imagine.

262
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,870
You know, if you're to sit in court and the needle in a haystack

263
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,789
to actually find that person and the suspicion is that he's out there

264
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,769
doing the same thing again and six months is just bullshit.

265
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:44,129
It's for the devastation and the ripple that causes.

266
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,710
It's just, it's not enough.

267
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,809
It must make you angry beyond despair to have had to go up

268
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:56,070
and face that creep and that coward and see that happen.

269
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,750
What's the answer to that?

270
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,669
First of all, Luke,

271
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:04,309
in my opinion, there's been a miscarriage of justice here

272
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,809
in that I heard the man's voice and as soon as he spoke,

273
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,610
because he had an Asian accent,

274
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,929
as soon as he spoke and said not guilty and that he's the victim,

275
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,470
I started shaking because I remembered that voice

276
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,230
and that should have been used as some sort of evidence

277
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,210
because I recognised his voice.

278
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:29,149
But more importantly, he was allowed to plead guilty,

279
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,649
to a lesser charge.

280
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,929
The consequences of his actions caused my son in part

281
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,350
to take his own life.

282
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:42,289
And there is something so wrong with the legal system

283
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,950
to allow people like that to get through the net

284
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,990
because I have no doubt that the 17% increase

285
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,490
in the suicide rate here in Victoria in this quarter

286
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,789
compared to the first quarter of 2023

287
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:58,789
is related to extortion sexually.

288
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,830
Because sexual extortion is up 400%.

289
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:09,440
And the number one killer for young males in Australia

290
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,299
from Mac's age at 16 through to 54 is taking your own life.

291
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,820
It's a horrific statistic.

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,340
You said to me before,

293
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,639
if I had have known what I know now,

294
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,860
I wouldn't be sitting here and Mac would still be alive.

295
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,899
What have you learnt that you need to share?

296
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,700
Yeah, definitely.

297
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,320
Thanks, Luke.

298
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,919
It's about looking out for the signs

299
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,860
and looking out for the signs.

300
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,840
And one of the signs is that they change completely

301
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,000
and all of a sudden become overly happy.

302
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,879
And we planned a trip to Hawaii

303
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,840
about six weeks before he took his own life.

304
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,039
And we'd all saved up for two years.

305
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,039
We hadn't been on a holiday for ages as a family.

306
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,100
And we all went.

307
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,799
And he not only saved up for that,

308
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,019
but he spent his whole savings on that trip.

309
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,940
And he was buying shoes for all of us,

310
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,759
buying all, taking us out to dinner.

311
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,480
And I'm thinking, this is really odd

312
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,879
because he just wanted to have it.

313
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,200
And the last night we went to this restaurant

314
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,299
and we had to wait a little while, about 15 minutes.

315
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,700
And he said, hey, Dad, can we sit over there?

316
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,519
And Maggie, my wife,

317
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,120
would you mind taking a photo of the two of us?

318
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,820
And he put his arm around me.

319
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,080
And he wasn't overly that way,

320
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,299
but he put his arm around me and was smiling.

321
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,179
And there was another sign.

322
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,820
He's doing things that are a bit unusual.

323
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:29,740
And then,

324
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,679
the very night before,

325
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
he was the happiest I've ever seen him.

326
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,580
He was kicking his younger daughter

327
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,399
underneath the table at the dinner table

328
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,960
because I was cracking some real stupid dad jokes.

329
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,059
And he said to me,

330
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,500
as he was going to bed at nine o'clock,

331
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,940
because he got up pretty early,

332
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,500
he said, hey, Dad,

333
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,879
can I drive my car to work tomorrow?

334
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
He's on L plates to work tomorrow.

335
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,279
And I said, yeah, mate, no worries.

336
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,419
Just we'll go together.

337
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,539
And the very last words he said to me was,

338
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,820
I can't wait to drive my car in the morning.

339
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,799
And so there's that.

340
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,120
And he was really happy.

341
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
So that's one of the things.

342
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,960
One of the other things is that

343
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,379
if kids stop doing things that they normally love doing,

344
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,960
and it might be they love going to footy training,

345
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,419
for example,

346
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,539
or they love painting,

347
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,740
or they love hiking,

348
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,159
and all of a sudden they stop it.

349
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,720
That's a sign.

350
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,360
Something's not quite right.

351
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,720
And one of the questions that

352
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,039
when I do my presentations for Smack Talk,

353
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:29,740
I talk about,

354
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,240
if you see that,

355
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,100
don't be afraid to go up and say to someone,

356
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,100
I used to ride your bike a whole lot.

357
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,500
How come you don't ride it anymore?

358
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
And if they can't look you in the eye,

359
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,960
and if they start shaking,

360
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
or if they get a bit teary,

361
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,220
that's an opportunity to ask further questions.

362
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,519
And typically,

363
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,080
typically it's around their mental fitness.

364
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,879
And one of the hardest questions to ask someone

365
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,299
that breaks down in front of you

366
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:55,139
and looks down

367
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,200
and doesn't want to look you in the eye.

368
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,100
And if you ask them

369
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,639
if they've got suicidal thoughts

370
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,820
and they break down,

371
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:03,799
that's when you're in lifeline

372
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,059
and you will save their life.

373
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,319
Look, I gave a presentation

374
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,000
about six weeks ago.

375
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,900
And it was in the afternoon.

376
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,359
It was in the eastern suburbs.

377
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,140
And there was 80 people there.

378
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,599
And it was for adults.

379
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,539
And this person had slipped through

380
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,539
that was 15

381
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,119
because he was six foot seven

382
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,299
and he's a basketballer.

383
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,880
And he was there with his mum and dad.

384
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,579
In the afternoon,

385
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,359
I got a call,

386
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,339
a random call,

387
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,079
but I picked it up.

388
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,380
I always pick up calls now.

389
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,460
And it was this young voice.

390
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,680
And he said to me,

391
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,559
hi,

392
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:35,579
he didn't recognise,

393
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,900
he didn't tell us what his name was.

394
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,559
I was at your session today

395
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,140
and I heard you speak.

396
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,220
And I said,

397
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,059
you're 15.

398
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,740
He said, yeah,

399
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,079
I was with mum and dad.

400
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,500
I said, who's with you now?

401
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,559
And he said, mum's with me.

402
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,359
You're on loudspeaker.

403
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,019
And I said, how can I help you?

404
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,059
And he said,

405
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,579
Luke, he said to me,

406
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,640
I was on a bridge last night

407
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,279
at 15.

408
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,880
And I said,

409
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,759
right, where are you?

410
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,200
And we got to him.

411
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,359
And mate,

412
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,079
I put my arm around him and his mum

413
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,079
when we were in Lifeline.

414
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,299
And he now is okay.

415
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,279
He's seeing a counsellor.

416
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,680
But he was ringing me

417
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,000
at seven o'clock every night

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
for about two or three weeks

419
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,039
every night

420
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,380
just as a comfort call

421
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,980
and thank you.

422
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,299
Mate,

423
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,460
I just wish I'd known that.

424
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,240
I would have saved Mac.

425
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,920
And something,

426
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,779
it just has to change,

427
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,019
Wayne,

428
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,140
in the most prolific way.

429
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,720
I was looking up

430
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,579
before this conversation last night

431
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:27,839
of,

432
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,559
Mark Zuckerberg

433
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,140
makes $205 billion

434
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,079
a year Australian

435
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,519
out of putting that app

436
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,980
on our phones.

437
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,619
He makes close to $12 billion

438
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,559
every three weeks.

439
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,380
Teen suicides are at record levels.

440
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,279
Anxiety and mental health epidemic

441
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,119
is just of the likes of which

442
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,000
people don't even quite understand.

443
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,259
Eating disorder crisis.

444
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,819
And it's irrefutably linked

445
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,200
to those social media apps

446
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,420
that cost Mac his life.

447
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,920
It's destroying a generation.

448
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,819
I know you've,

449
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,099
you've spent time

450
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,180
lobbying government.

451
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,460
You're consistently up in Canberra

452
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,339
wanting to make a difference.

453
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,339
What's your message?

454
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,980
What do you say?

455
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:06,420
Yeah,

456
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,779
firstly,

457
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,839
my message to him,

458
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,200
hopefully he gets this one day,

459
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
is that he's cheating.

460
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,819
He's come into Australia

461
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,440
with his product or service

462
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
and doesn't fulfil the values

463
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,319
that Australians hold

464
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,180
nor the laws that they portray.

465
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:23,819
You know,

466
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,099
he had to stand for the sixth time

467
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:25,799
in front of the Senate,

468
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,160
turn around to a gallery

469
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,799
of 100 families,

470
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,880
had kids take their lives

471
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
and had to stand there

472
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,619
and they made him look at them

473
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:34,900
and made him take some accountability

474
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,079
and you thought that needle changed.

475
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,700
But we know whenever greed knows no bounds

476
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,819
and what does one human do

477
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,059
with that amount of money is in itself.

478
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,160
So there's so much scope

479
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,920
to be able to pull that back, isn't there?

480
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,799
But we, and we can make it,

481
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,839
we can make a difference.

482
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,319
India banned TikTok in a day.

483
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,779
That's right.

484
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:53,220
Done.

485
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:54,680
That's over.

486
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,079
Yep.

487
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,940
And, and I think with,

488
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,720
with him,

489
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,400
for an example,

490
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,180
you know,

491
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,420
it's not about the money,

492
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,440
it's about the power

493
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,980
and that reminds me of a person

494
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,920
that, you know,

495
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,940
terrorised his race way back

496
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,859
and we know who Adolf Hitler was

497
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:09,099
and I really,

498
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,500
I really worry about

499
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,640
that style of person

500
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,940
infiltrating Australia

501
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,720
with the power that he has.

502
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,440
However,

503
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,460
we now have an opportunity.

504
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,059
We know as Australians

505
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,279
that this exposure

506
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,000
is killing our young folk.

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
We have no,

508
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,579
no difficulty in understanding

509
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:29,019
that there's a direct relationship

510
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,000
with what they're being fed,

511
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,980
the algorithms that are underpinning

512
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,660
and,

513
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,299
and then the actions

514
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,759
that particularly young boys

515
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,059
and young girls are taking,

516
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:39,799
you know,

517
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,359
through eating disorders,

518
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,900
through sexual extortion,

519
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,339
through bullying.

520
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,960
And so we as Australians

521
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,740
have to say to the government,

522
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,339
enough is enough.

523
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,619
You have to make a call

524
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,839
on what our kids are allowed to do.

525
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,460
You tell them that

526
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,140
they have to wear a seatbelt in a car.

527
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,299
You tell them that you can't drive

528
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,099
until you're 18.

529
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:03,980
You say they can't drink

530
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,819
until they're 18,

531
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
although some do.

532
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:08,460
Why don't you?

533
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,440
Why don't you make a law

534
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,319
that says that kids under 16

535
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,480
cannot be exposed to this?

536
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,859
And if it needs to be 18,

537
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,559
so be it.

538
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,519
Because if the government does that

539
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,440
and I know Whipper's doing

540
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,740
a really good job in lobbying,

541
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,960
the kids be kids

542
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
are doing the same thing.

543
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,059
There's a joint select committee

544
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,099
set up in Canberra

545
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,579
that I met last week.

546
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,160
Some of the people

547
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,960
that are involved in that,

548
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,079
the chairperson of that,

549
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,240
they all agree

550
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,759
that this has to happen.

551
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,180
Well, bloody do it.

552
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:40,779
Get it done in August

553
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,960
and get legislation in November

554
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,319
and save our kids

555
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,140
because there will be some kids

556
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,839
that are clever enough

557
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,700
to get around it

558
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,640
and they'll work it out

559
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,759
or Zuckerberg

560
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,180
will sort something out.

561
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
But if we can at least

562
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,859
save 50% of those kids

563
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:56,599
and make it easier on the parents

564
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,420
so the parents aren't the bad guys,

565
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,420
it's the law.

566
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,279
I was home last night

567
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,119
and the conversation

568
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,539
still every night,

569
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,380
17 and 13 year olds still there,

570
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,160
the phones get locked in another room,

571
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
you fight to get them off them.

572
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,140
I've got active kids

573
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,640
that are healthy

574
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,940
and doing a whole range of things

575
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,119
but it's something that

576
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,359
I have people say to me,

577
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,980
just take them off it

578
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,920
and they are always people

579
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,519
who aren't parents.

580
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,819
Correct.

581
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,140
This is where their whole connection,

582
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,000
it's like asking them

583
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,319
to cut an arm or a leg off

584
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,420
is what you're effectively doing

585
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,599
and remove themselves

586
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,799
from their whole community.

587
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,180
What we need are some guardrails.

588
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,319
Now we're fighting hard

589
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:31,960
on the home fronts.

590
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,519
All of us,

591
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,519
we're not asleep at the wheel here

592
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,059
as parents

593
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:35,880
but as we said,

594
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:36,220
you know,

595
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,200
Seatbelts saved

596
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,339
tens of thousands of lives

597
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:41,339
because we needed legislation

598
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:41,819
to do,

599
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,180
there is no downside

600
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,039
Whippers campaign

601
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,880
to get the 36 months

602
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,900
and the age limit up

603
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,779
is an absolute no brainer.

604
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,460
We can go further on this,

605
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,779
do zero damage

606
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,160
and only have the upside

607
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,920
and I think

608
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,640
we just,

609
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,559
we can't afford

610
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,740
more tragedies like this.

611
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:58,099
They're happening

612
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,140
far too often, Wayne

613
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,500
and for you to,

614
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:01,279
as you said,

615
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,880
take the path of education,

616
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:03,819
you know,

617
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:04,980
more strength to your arm on this.

618
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,880
Yeah, thanks mate.

619
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,180
Look,

620
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,960
you know the figures.

621
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,279
There was 801 people

622
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,200
that took their own life

623
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,519
in Victoria alone

624
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,759
in 2023.

625
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,380
There were 299 people

626
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,160
die on the road

627
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,660
so it's two and a half times

628
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,259
the number of people

629
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:19,859
died on the road,

630
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,539
took their life

631
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,480
compared to dying on the roads

632
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,640
and 50 people drowned.

633
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,099
So in comparison,

634
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,519
and when I was growing up

635
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,960
in the mid-70s,

636
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,220
there was a campaign

637
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,920
Declare War on 1034

638
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,099
because it was 1034 people

639
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,599
died on Victorian roads

640
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,940
that year

641
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,920
and now it's down to 299.

642
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
As you said, Luke,

643
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,460
we're the first country,

644
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,140
our first state in the world

645
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,759
to introduce compulsory seatbelts,

646
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,180
drink driving laws,

647
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,099
better roads,

648
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,619
better vehicles,

649
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:49,599
better education

650
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,140
so it can be done.

651
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,319
We have to do it

652
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,700
because our kids

653
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,539
are becoming,

654
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,700
they're so precious

655
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,599
and to lose them

656
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,960
because of things

657
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,140
that we're in control of,

658
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,819
it's not as if they've developed

659
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,940
a rare form of cancer

660
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,079
or they're in a car accident

661
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,019
and it's unavoidable.

662
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,619
This is avoidable

663
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,640
and we're lame as citizens

664
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
if we don't force the government

665
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,539
to make a difference

666
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,480
and to change it.

667
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,880
They'll look back on our generation

668
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,220
and shake their head

669
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,680
and say,

670
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,119
what the fuck did you guys do?

671
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,119
And the language,

672
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,920
the language is there on purpose

673
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,359
because the solutions are there

674
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,359
and I have to mention

675
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,259
this beautiful,

676
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
extraordinary person,

677
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:34,359
Zoe Kalar,

678
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,599
who's created We Are Right.

679
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
I don't know if you've come across it.

680
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,920
It takes out the anonymity

681
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,619
so immediately 90% of the hate is gone.

682
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,039
It's social media for good.

683
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:45,359
It's putting that 135 billion US

684
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,099
from Zuckerberg

685
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,819
back into the hands of community.

686
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,839
It's only positivity in there.

687
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:51,960
They could switch off

688
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,539
the hate and the algorithms tomorrow

689
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,660
but they keep you on those apps

690
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,539
with anxiety,

691
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:56,759
anger,

692
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,599
because they know

693
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,599
that's what keeps you

694
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,259
and they jam advertising at you

695
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:01,119
to make more money.

696
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,160
We can pull that back.

697
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:03,759
You know, government,

698
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,240
spend your digital advertising

699
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,079
on We Are Right.

700
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,900
Let's get the community voice

701
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,440
coming through.

702
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,180
Let's legislate to up the age limit,

703
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,220
which is a no-brainer.

704
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,700
Let's have an education program

705
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,119
that you're doing every single day

706
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,400
teaching families

707
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
how to deal with this better

708
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,220
to save lives.

709
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,319
It's an incredible contribution

710
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,180
you're making, Wayne.

711
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,259
I know it's heartbreaking

712
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,059
to even think about

713
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,079
what you've been through

714
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,940
but, you know,

715
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,119
I didn't meet your beautiful

716
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,779
young lad, mate.

717
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:30,400
I wish I did

718
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,759
but I feel like he's going to save

719
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,460
a lot of people, mate.

720
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,319
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,099
I'm doing it.

722
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,779
I'm doing what I do now

723
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,000
to create a legacy for him

724
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,059
and to use his death as a catalyst

725
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,519
to do more in this space

726
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,839
and, you know,

727
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,539
I've been out now to see

728
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,140
just over 1,500 people

729
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,200
normally in the after hours

730
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,259
because I work, you know,

731
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,700
Monday to Saturday

732
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,039
in basketball full-time.

733
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,599
And my board have been

734
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,559
really supportive

735
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,359
to allow me to do

736
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,099
what I need to do

737
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:00,960
to help the community.

738
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,039
And when I talk to people

739
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,339
about the signs,

740
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,460
it's new to them.

741
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,240
When I talk to them

742
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,039
about the statistics,

743
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,119
it's new to them.

744
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,680
You know, one in five people

745
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,779
here in Australia

746
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,000
have suicidal thoughts.

747
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,339
You know, we talk about

748
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,420
fitness in the footy field.

749
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,460
You know, we see someone

750
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,059
limping into the change rooms

751
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:20,799
and, you know,

752
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:21,980
Christian Petrarca, you know,

753
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,319
coming off the ground

754
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,240
and, you know,

755
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,680
that's had so much

756
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,039
exposure.

757
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:26,839
Because it was such

758
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,940
a horrific injury.

759
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,500
Because we can see it.

760
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,460
But mental fitness,

761
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,700
we can't see it.

762
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,279
But I want people to ask

763
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,460
not only how you're going,

764
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:38,039
Christian, you know,

765
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,559
physically,

766
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,740
but how's your mental fitness going?

767
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,220
And if he says,

768
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,500
shit, it's at about five or six now,

769
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,519
we need to talk to him more.

770
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,339
And we need to be talking

771
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,940
to people that have got

772
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,220
mental challenges

773
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,240
and to be able to support them

774
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,019
through that.

775
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,400
And know what to do.

776
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,039
You know, 12 people

777
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,539
have come into my office alone.

778
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,440
You know, big basketballs.

779
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,920
You think that are

780
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,880
impervious to this.

781
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,319
They've come in crying.

782
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,099
You know, I have to tell them

783
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:10,960
to sit down so I can

784
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,779
get level with them.

785
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,720
You know, and

786
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,380
they're in a world of pain.

787
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
But if I can do that

788
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,319
and then I refer them on

789
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,400
to someone that can help them,

790
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,400
they multiply that by

791
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,079
20 and 40 and 100.

792
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,000
And then we're fighting back.

793
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
And so,

794
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,500
my program called

795
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,140
Smack Talk.

796
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,819
So if anyone wants to jump online

797
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:30,559
and book a session,

798
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,460
it's free.

799
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,460
I go out to anywhere in Victoria.

800
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,920
I'm going to New South Wales

801
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,259
and Queensland on weekends

802
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,980
to educate people,

803
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,380
sporting groups,

804
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,480
corporate groups.

805
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,700
And I'll talk to mums and dads

806
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,640
about the signs,

807
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,539
about having good listing skills,

808
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,819
about the statistics.

809
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,740
Just trying to make a difference, mate.

810
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,299
Why no one would choose this path.

811
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,519
You didn't choose this path.

812
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,460
But, you know,

813
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,140
heroes come in,

814
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,339
all shapes and sizes.

815
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,400
And, yeah,

816
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,039
I'm full of admiration for

817
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,240
you and your family

818
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
and what you've been through.

819
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,339
And thanks for joining me today

820
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:03,900
and telling the story.

821
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:04,940
Thanks very much, Luke.

822
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:05,400
Pleasure.

823
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,519
