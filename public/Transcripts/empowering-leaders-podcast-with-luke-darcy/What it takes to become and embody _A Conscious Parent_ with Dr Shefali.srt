00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,960
with the extraordinary Dr. Shefali from her office in New York.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,560
Dr. Shefali is arguably the world's leading voice on parenting.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,019
You'll hear Shefali talk about how idiotic and crazy her words are, the old model of

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,800
parenting is.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,120
The strange notion, she says, that we think our kids owe us something and the revolution

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,800
she's starting that tells parents that we need to work on ourselves before we can have

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,740
any hope of parenting consciously, a word that she uses and has really brought to the

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,200
mainstream, conscious parenting.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,219
She reminds us that we actually learn more from our kids than our kids learn from us.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,500
And you'll hear her bemusement, the story I tell her that in Australia we have parent

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,439
umpire escorts at junior sport to protect teenage umpires from other parents and that

13
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,240
sometimes the umpire escorts themselves abuse umpires.

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,460
She found that extraordinary but not surprising would be the way I would describe it.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,520
Thank you.

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,000

76
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,060
some time with you this morning thanks for your time oh absolutely thank you for having me

77
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,340
shifali we're passionate in the conversations i have around talking to different leaders in

78
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,219
different settings and i love the opportunity whether it's someone who works in sport or works

79
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:11,879
in the arts or in a range of different areas but probably to me the thing shifali that unites us

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,360
all is our leadership on the home front and you've put that term conscious parenting on the map

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
globally can you explain for you what conscious parenting

82
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:27,159
means so in order to understand conscious parenting we do need to understand the traditional

83
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,020
parenting model which conscious parenting is trying to revolutionize so the traditional

84
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,939
parenting model is the one that probably you and i were raised in it's a model steeped in

85
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:48,939
parent knows best children should be obedient and follow the parents ways and it is bathed in

86
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,900
a fear-based model

87
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:59,080
of parenting mostly it's an underpinning of fear and control and shame and then all the things that

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:06,120
come when the child is not controllable and conscious parenting debunks that and changes

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,120
the playing field and talks about how the parent really needs to raise themselves i mean that's what

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,399
parenting is otherwise it would be called childing or kidding right some people say

91
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,899
kidding because the focus is on the parent

92
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,199
and i think when we don't focus on the parent and we instead focus on the child

93
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:35,279
presuming that we have this uber control and it's our mandate to have this control and use this

94
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:44,600
control to raise supersonic super achieving perfect children then this actually absolves

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,920
the parent of any real accountability for what they bring into the dynamic for how they

96
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:57,100
mess up their children and how they actually obstruct their children from achieving the very

97
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,620
goals that we think we should be achieving such as self-worth and empowerment and leadership and

98
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:10,680
direction the old paradigm the traditional model actually greatly impinges on our capacity to foster

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,879
that in our children so conscious parenting is a revolutionary model that speaks about speaks to

100
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,920
the parent raising themselves and i think it's a very important model that we need to be able to

101
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:27,019
understand that they must do the inner work to heal their own inner baggage from childhood

102
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:34,160
so that they can then truly see their children for who their children are versus an extension of their

103
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,120
utopic fantasy and uh all these expectations that the parent thinks is their right to have

104
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,319
around their children yeah it's such a brilliant shift in in mindset for everyone who's a parent

105
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,779
in my mind i love how you talk about perfect parenting

106
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,519
is your language that there's no ideal parent there's no ideal child and and i often talk you

107
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,079
know as a father of four that parenting guilt you get sometimes when you have a bad moment or you

108
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,819
yell at one of your kids or you know you just generally lose your cool or you get it wrong

109
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,720
is your message to that to say hey you know what you just got to do the best you possibly can with

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,160
the resources available to you and and strive to be the best example and then you are going to get

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,920
it wrong sometimes yeah we are going to get it wrong a lot of the times and even just what

112
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,720
you said that when our child is doing something wrong even that we can't say with objectivity

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,939
because that frame that interpretation is based on our conditioning our emotional baggage i mean

114
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,980
we could call a two-year-old throwing a tantrum as doing something wrong when actually they're

115
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,199
doing nothing wrong like zero nothing there's no need to even get upset the reason we get upset

116
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,759
is because we had an expectation and a

117
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,560
of how we would be in control and how the child would follow our ways so any deviation from that

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,519
we label as bad the child is doing something wrong and then we have this thing in the traditional

119
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:10,220
parenting model called parental discipline and we have this unchecked unlicensed unsupervised

120
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,259
power of our children to utilize anything under that rubric and actually we call it love so it's

121
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,759
all so messed up and uh it really

122
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:28,819
has consequences and we're seeing the consequences in our own lives we see oh damn i'm really not

123
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:36,879
filled with worth i'm really not uh independent and directed i'm heavily enmeshed or codependent

124
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,839
or passive and all these things come from early childhood patterns and the mandate that the

125
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,720
parent has that they need to create a child needs to be transformed to a mandate that they need to

126
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
heal themselves

127
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:57,620
and if we can just heal ourselves 95 of our problems with our children will go away because

128
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,620
our children will still have issues and they will still meet failure and they will still

129
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,160
enter dysfunctional relationships but the way we handle it will be so vastly profoundly

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,560
altered transformed and you know we can always make the choice of do i need to control the child

131
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
which is the old mandate or can i seek to understand attune

132
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:27,019
and connect with the child so conscious parenting moves away from control and fear and shame from

133
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:34,440
the old paradigm to one of connection before control and correction yeah and when you articulate

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,399
it as beautifully as you do there it's it's such the worthwhile goal and the attempt to uh to

135
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
achieve that makes a lot of sense that where do you sit then on some boundaries for your kids

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,919
as you said not control but you are as you said you know trying to fill them with love and love and

137
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,480
fill them with being present but clearly at some stage there has to be some boundaries as a parent

138
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,559
as well how do you how do you feel about that yeah well you you've asked the quote this in the third

139
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,240
question going into the interview uh because it's such a common example of when i start talking

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,399
about this immediately parents feel heckled like oh my goodness she's she's bullying me into

141
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,779
something and i cannot give up this control so you call it boundaries but but you're

142
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,960
coming from fear like hello can we have any boundaries right so i never said we can't have

143
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,220
boundaries but i think what people hear is oh she's talking about an anarchy and i refuse

144
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:40,480
to live in an anarchy and of course boundaries are part of any conscious relationship we aren't

145
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,940
going to give our children alcohol at the age of five and crack cocaine at the age of 10 don't

146
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,679
worry i'm not advocating that we we in fact have more boundaries when we're healed

147
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,659
we actually have a greater sense of awareness and attunement of what the child needs because

148
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:06,500
we're truly in the present moment not using the child for our own idealistic utopic fantasies

149
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,460
that are really a reflection of how bad we feel for ourselves and we're truly present so when

150
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,740
we're truly present with someone after being present for ourselves including our children

151
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,779
we automatically

152
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,720
have sane logical boundaries. You see, most of our boundaries come from this insane need to have

153
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,019
so many rules. And then we feel out of control when all these rules are not met, right? We have

154
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:42,580
to bathe them at 6.05 and have dinner by 7.42 and in bed by 8.12. We've created all these rules.

155
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:50,620
And it's because we have not examined how conditioned we are in culture. So the other

156
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,539
day, a family came to me, a couple with two children, and their biggest fight is that the

157
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:02,519
two children, no matter that their ages were four and six, some real small age, real young age,

158
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:08,539
these children were not sitting at the dinner table to eat dinner. And so when I, this is such

159
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,200
a common thing, you would wonder that, you know, why would people spend so much money to fix this

160
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,299
situation? But apparently it's a big deal. So when children don't sit at the table, parents lose their

161
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,600
shit, because it's our

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,580
conditioning that happy families sit together and talk, adult style, right? Well, children don't sit

163
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,360
at tables, and they don't want to sit with the adults, and they don't want to talk. Children

164
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,679
play, children move, children laugh, children giggle, children are aimlessly distracted.

165
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,879
And it drives parents crazy. So we've created a rule. And now we're talking about disrespectful

166
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,639
children. And now we're talking about punishment and boundaries. Guess what? None of it was

167
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,080
important.

168
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,100
None of it. We could just have had dinner on the floor, or dinner while moving and dancing and

169
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,559
playing. And so it comes from a conditioning. And once we examine our conditioning, and realize

170
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,440
that most of our conditioning is artificial, and really not attuned to what's happening before us,

171
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:17,200
we would realize that, oh, this idea of boundaries, which is amazing, but really, we mean control,

172
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,799
is not even important.

173
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,639
I bet you, if I took the last five times you were triggered by your children,

174
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,080
I can show you that it had to do with your conditioning and nothing to do with bad children.

175
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:38,500
Beautifully said. And yeah, it is a revolution, isn't it? And it does make sense. The practice

176
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,940
of it is the interesting part as well. You touched on this at the start, Dr. Shefali,

177
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,120
when you were talking about this obsession parents have got. I see in our community,

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,600
we've got a two-year-old with a golf club in his hand. You can see someone's trying to create the

179
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,120
next Tiger Woods. And I often hear parents with their kids during their last year of high school

180
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,179
saying, we're doing year 12. And all of the social engineering to try and get the friends they want

181
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:08,080
their kids to get. Can you expand on that? What's your advice to parents? Because that seems to be

182
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,120
such commonplace now, living vicariously through our kids. Yes. So that is a psychological disease.

183
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,159
And you have to ask yourself as a parent,

184
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:27,700
why do I need my child to achieve a social status or a level of greatness? Why? No, really, why?

185
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:35,279
We only do that not because we love our children, but because we feel so much inner lack of worth

186
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,840
ourselves that we use our children vicariously to fulfill that inner void. Because if you are

187
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,700
a fulfilled human being, and if you are very content in your own life's purpose, you will be

188
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,919
to allow your child to discover their own. And you will not direct it and micromanage it

189
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,919
because you don't need the badge of honor that your child is the next Tiger Woods.

190
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,539
And parents don't like this. But this is the revolution. We cannot use our children

191
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:11,720
to fill this emptiness within us. Our children's lives are theirs. They have nothing to do with

192
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,220
ours. Yes, they cost us a bundle and their pain in the neck. But the reward of that is not that

193
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,960
they now have to achieve greatness.

194
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,259
For us, the reward has to be implicit in the fact that we chose to have these children.

195
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,240
But now we have no right or jurisdiction to dictate and mandate how they live their lives.

196
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,500
Because we've decided that that's an honorable goal to be the next Tiger Woods or to be the next

197
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,179
Serena or Venus. And it worked for Serena and Venus, but please do not think it'll work for you.

198
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,759
And we don't know the cost. And we don't know the price.

199
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Both the parent and the family and those children paid. And we've heard many stories of

200
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,980
adult superstars who talk about the plague of their childhood and how childhood was robbed

201
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,320
from them. Our children deserve a childhood to be children, not to become superstars in

202
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,259
the making for us parents to affix to a goal that will make us feel very worthy.

203
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,100
And I love, again, how you say, kids owe you nothing. They may choose to give you,

204
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,720
some love and respect, but they don't owe you anything. And that you talk about a savior

205
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,139
complex that we have and that martyrdom of parenting. It's again, another paradigm that

206
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,720
has to be shifted, doesn't it? Because it just results in more pain.

207
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,720
Right. So we have a savior complex. Some of us, not all of us, but those of us who have,

208
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,399
have this kind of playing God in our children's lives because we couldn't save ourselves and we

209
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,720
could not save our partners that we tried.

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,500
Uh, desperately. It doesn't work with adults. It's, and we think, ah, these children are ours

211
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,539
and therefore their mind to possess and control. I can play savior and God with them. And it's a

212
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:09,879
real Machiavellian, uh, manic delusion that we suffer from, but we, it's couched. You see,

213
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,700
it's disguised in love, in this idea that you're loving your children, right? So parents will say,

214
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,100
oh my goodness, I spent my whole life for the past 10 years.

215
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,659
At the baseball field. And I gave up all my weekends, but I don't think any child ever at

216
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:31,240
the age of four said to their parents, please, you know, I want to live my entire weekends for

217
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,120
the next 10 years on a baseball field. And if they do, and if they love it, they won't need

218
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,580
the parents sitting there sacrificing their time. So it's just a very contorted overzealous approach

219
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,960
that we parents have. And if we're really honest, which few of us are, it's because we want to

220
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,100
fill in the blanks.

221
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,440
A mandate about how we can be better parents for ourselves. We, we feel successful when we

222
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,820
see our children be successful. So Shafali, in the moment for parents, because, you know,

223
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,619
it's, it's, when you're sitting here having a nice relaxing conversation with you, it's a,

224
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,759
it's an easier conversation, but as we all know, we get stressed and we get tired and,

225
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,240
um, and moments happen. What sort of strategies have you got then

226
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
in those stressful moments to, to be more conscious?

227
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah. Well, listening to me is really never relaxing people, you know, get driven to anxiety

228
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,819
and they turn, they probably already turned off the podcast, um, because I call parents to examine

229
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:36,759
themselves and no one likes to do that. So in the moment, practical strategies, right. It there's,

230
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:41,779
there, there are none really, uh, you have to go through a process. So I wrote this book called

231
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:48,660
the parenting map. It's my fourth parenting book because I give the how to, but the how to,

232
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:55,980
has 20 steps. And most of them have to do with us examining our belief systems. Why are you on

233
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,720
that baseball field at two o'clock on a Saturday when you are exhausted and cranky and your child

234
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,460
is hating it and you're hating it? Why asking yourself at every moment, what am I doing here?

235
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,619
Is this about me or is this about my child? So the first practical strategy is awareness

236
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:18,319
and awareness doesn't seem practical, does it? Uh, every parent wants me to just say the magic

237
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,220
words and there's a wand and I can sell the wand. And that's the practical strategy. The

238
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,420
practical strategy is only awareness. And after awareness is activation of choices. You make

239
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,279
different choices, but you have to undo belief systems to make different choices. Parenting is

240
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,420
really the most unlicensed, uh, you know, job in the world where we don't have any mental status

241
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,119
check to, to become a parent. We are unsupervised. There's no continuing education.

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,299
And that is, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

243
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,380
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

244
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,140
it's appalling, isn't it? Uh, because again, the delusion of the old paradigm is that parents

245
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,220
know best. We actually don't know best actually. I mean, just this morning I was telling a mother,

246
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,440
uh, you know, can you actually not take your child out to lunch? And she was like, why? I

247
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,400
wanted to bond. I said, no, you don't want to bond. You want your child to bond to you.

248
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,920
There's a big difference. And she's like, no, no, no, no, no. I just wanted to find out how

249
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,279
she's doing. I said, uh-huh. You wanted to find out how she's doing.

250
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,660
We always have an agenda. Every sentence is an agenda. And she, she finally was like, okay,

251
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:28,359
what do you want me to do? I said, if you tell me you're going for lunch simply to exude love,

252
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:34,480
to exude warmth and, uh, give your child a sense of worth, then you can go. But if you're going

253
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,740
for a transaction or a deal or a negotiation or an agenda that you're going to feel good about

254
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,859
your parenting, that is not conscious parenting. And children figure that out and children

255
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,680
dissociate from us and they disconnect because they sense that every time they're around this

256
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,599
person, AKA the parent, there's something that needs to be done that they're not doing. And

257
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:01,960
there's always a life lesson and there's always an opinion and a sermon and a lecture. And the

258
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,400
practical is to connect. But first you have to be aware that you're not connected to your children.

259
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:15,559
You're using them as objects and minions, puppets to arrive at point A and children don't want to

260
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,920
arrive anywhere. They just want to be seen for the essence. It's like us going out with friends

261
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,319
and you have this friend who constantly tries to make you something else, makes you lose weight,

262
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,140
wear the right sunscreen, change your hairstyle, right? That's how we parents are.

263
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,900
And we don't like that friend. We like the friend who accepts us for who we are

264
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,079
and then works with that, but first sees us for who we are. So parents, when they listen to this,

265
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,920
they're like, Oh, what, you know, what rubbish? Of course I see my child for who it is they are.

266
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,539
I can guarantee you,

267
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:52,759
if, if every parent saw their child for who it is they truly were, we would not have addicts.

268
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,839
We would not have dysfunction. We would not have anger the way we do. We would be living in a very

269
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:06,299
different society. So the power of attuning to your child takes tremendous parental consciousness,

270
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,980
discipline, boundaries. The parent really needs the boundaries. It's the parent who's out of

271
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,539
control. Yeah. It's, it's so powerful. The words that,

272
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,720
you say, and it, and it does resonate so strongly. I've been smiling through this because your mind

273
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,839
goes to your own parenting, isn't it? And, and, and your own challenges in your own failures. And

274
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,119
just to me, it's the ultimate goal, isn't it? To want to do this, to do this well. And I was

275
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,059
thinking we've got four Shefali, our three boys and a girl, our second eldest is our only daughter,

276
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,079
Sienna. And we get very direct feedback from her at 18 years of age. She said to me the other day,

277
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,859
she said, I get my anger issues from you and my bitchiness from mum, she said the other day.

278
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,539
And for us,

279
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,000
any sense that you're trying to overlay any of you, your stuff on her, she just immediately gives

280
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,980
you the feedback. And it's like the kids know, they actually tell you, don't they? If you stop

281
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,559
and listen, it's like, Hey, I am doing that there. I am overlaying just, uh, be present as you said.

282
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,200
And, and then it tends to work out. Right. And, and there are certain boundaries that are

283
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,920
in stone. And I talk about that in one of my books, there are life enhancing boundaries,

284
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,259
like have a shower, please, at least a few times a week and brush your teeth every day.

285
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,440
And can you please go to school and just get through till 12th grade? Can we at least get an

286
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,559
education? Of course, but they're very few. If you really count the true life enhancing boundaries,

287
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,339
they're not more than five. I can guarantee you. And I've listed them out because how do we know

288
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:37,680
something is life enhancing and therefore should be in stone? It's because it'll be ubiquitous.

289
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,819
It'll be something that we all have to do in the modern world. And I say modern world,

290
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,440
because I can take out two from that.

291
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:51,299
Five, because in the old world, we didn't even have to do all five, but there's only five. So

292
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:58,000
if you as a parent stay aligned to, is this life or death? Is this worth going to war for? Is this

293
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,819
really important? If we all were going to die tomorrow, then you stay really calm, really

294
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:09,680
stable. Life is bliss and everyone's in flow. But because the modern world doesn't stay basic and

295
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,160
simple, and we've added pottery lessons and no, no, no dissing pottery, but,

296
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,059
being backwards and sign language and playing the trombone and learning how to make jewelry.

297
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:25,180
I mean, just endless things we want our children to become when they grow up. A little bit of

298
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,220
Julia Roberts, a little bit of Michael Phelps, a little bit of a football star, a little bit of

299
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,660
the Dalai Lama, a little bit of the Mother Teresa. I mean, we're crazy. Every day we have a new goal

300
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,099
for our children, right? So who drives the ship? We do, and we're driving it into the gutter.

301
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:44,480
You know, our children will tell us very clearly how to proceed.

302
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,619
What to invest in. And then parents will tell me, oh, but I just signed my four-year-old for a year

303
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:55,799
of piano lessons. And I say to the parent, well, what were you thinking? Like, do you not know who

304
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,900
a four-year-old is? Do you not know who a 17-year-old is? Don't spend money on them, right?

305
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,420
Don't invest in long-term projects because these children have holes in their brain and their brain

306
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:13,079
cannot sustain long-term goals, right? My child is 20, my daughter. I'm still telling her to say

307
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,099
please and thank you. I'll be so happy if...

308
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,599
That'll come out voluntarily from her mouth. And I'm so impressed at my parenting when it does.

309
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:25,660
So if you keep it very simple and you keep the expectations basic,

310
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,059
just because they are a completely different human being. We think we can micromanage this

311
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,720
entity, this corporation called these children. And that is our delusion. And we set ourselves

312
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,200
up and them up for failure. So every turn of the childhood, there's a failure happening.

313
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,819
Because of an unimaginable, impossible expectation. Take away the expectation,

314
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,559
the child is never a disappointment. Understand who children are, children will rarely disappoint

315
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:04,339
you because they're on point children. If you understand how really fragile their memory is

316
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:10,440
and how really disorganized and scrambled their brains are, you will have very, very basic

317
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,480
expectations. And then everything is a win after that. But if you have highfalutin,

318
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,759
expectations, you're setting yourself up. It's just like in a marriage, right? Really know who

319
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,460
your person is. Don't think there's something they're not. And don't think you can carve them

320
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,579
into something they're not because you will really suffer. And Shefala, you mentioned your

321
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:37,579
own daughter. Is there a layer when you're the conscious parenting expert globally and your

322
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:45,099
daughter is aware of that? Does that add an extra layer for you? It adds a lot of pressure. And I

323
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:51,779
tell my daughter to not hang out with my people unless she's willing to represent properly. And I

324
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:58,240
tell her, but she loves it. Oh, she just eats it up. And every time I lose my mind or I'm acting

325
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:06,039
very, very childish, she loves to tell me, oh, who is the conscious parent now? Oh, I see Dr.

326
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:11,559
Shefali. I see Dr. Shefali here. And she puts me in my place, but I love it because I want to be

327
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,539
called out. And I'm not pretending to be amazing in the first place.

328
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:23,579
So that's why in all my books, I write about my four powers and my absolute wretched ego and

329
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:29,160
talk about the fact that this is what it means to be a parent. But we all think we're these

330
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,359
infallible human beings and then set up our children to believe they need to be

331
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,440
perfectionistic, infallible beings because we're all living in utter

332
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:45,099
unacceptance of who it is we are as we are.

333
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:51,799
I'm okay being a total failure as a parent. You see, I'm okay if my child tells me that. I'm okay

334
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:58,420
with my child being ordinary, but most people are not. And that's why we live in inauthentic

335
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,740
relationships and everyone is faking it and hiding our true selves from each other.

336
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,279
Yeah, again, they're incredible words of wisdom. And as you said, you zoom out and you think of all

337
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,920
the challenges that are going on in the world, aren't they? As you said, with addiction and

338
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,539
the disconnect that's going on in the world. And I think that's a really important thing.

339
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,880
So much of it on the home front, isn't it? If we can understand that as accepting our kids for who

340
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,599
they are and being there. Nurture versus nature, where do you sit on that? It's one of the ultimate

341
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:34,980
debates, isn't it? How much do we affect them in the home front? How much influence do we have?

342
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:43,880
Well, there is an inexplicable and indisputable temperament and biological truth. I cannot

343
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,539
have brown eyes. I cannot have brown eyes. I cannot have brown eyes. I cannot have brown eyes. I cannot

344
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:53,259
be who I'm not on some basic biological level. And that biology feeds our temperament and the

345
00:27:53,259 --> 00:28:00,259
temperament comes wired. Now, of course, we have neuroplasticity and of course, there's epigenetics.

346
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,240
But the mold, you know, with four children, it's kind of set. You kind of saw the differences

347
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,200
right away. My daughter is who she is today that she was at two years old,

348
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,539
just a grown up version of that. So when we honor the temperament,

349
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:23,220
which I call the essence, and we flow with that child's essence, we will have so much more flow

350
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:31,279
and beauty. You know, when my child was around, I think, 10 or 12, I wanted to be a competitive

351
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,279
mother, right? I wanted my child to be in horse riding champion races and do all the tournaments.

352
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,480
I wanted to buy a horse, buy a stable. I loved everything about it. It was all me, me, me.

353
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,539
But I tried to pretend it was me. I tried to pretend it was me. I tried to pretend it was me.

354
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,579
It could be her. And I was like, every other child I was seeing was in competitions. And my

355
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:57,440
daughter told me clearly, Mom, I hate it. I'm not a ham. I don't like attention. I don't like to be

356
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,579
judged. But I didn't listen. And I pushed her because I said to myself, no, no, when she she

357
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,720
doesn't know what she's talking about, when she does her first competition and does well, she will

358
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,240
see how amazing that aphrodisiac is because I'm a glutton for it. Surely she'll be a glutton for it.

359
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,259
So I pushed her.

360
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,839
She did it. She came second. And I thought, ah, see, I knew best. I should just see. Now she's

361
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,920
going to come out so thrilled and tell me, thank you, mother. You're my lifesaver. And

362
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:33,660
you've given me purpose. And she came out of the ring so angry with me. And she threw her,

363
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,440
you know, I had made beautiful pigtails. She threw the ribbon through the $500 jacket and

364
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,900
threw the helmet. I was like, what's wrong? Like you won. And she said, I don't care about winning.

365
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,539
I told her.

366
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:51,440
I hate being judged. I hate being the center of attention. And do you know what happened? She

367
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,059
gave up horse riding all together. She stopped horse riding. Like to punish me, she stopped

368
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:04,880
horse riding. And I was so humbled. And I blamed myself. And I immediately realized that I was

369
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,160
trying to push it. By then, I had done enough work on myself. But see, still, I pushed it. Even

370
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,519
though I was 10 years into conscious parenting, I was like, no, no, no, I can definitely push her.

371
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,759
And I apologized. And to this day, she will tell people how I've ruined her love for horses. I

372
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:27,980
ruined her childhood. She's right on that level. I totally didn't listen to her. And she knew best.

373
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:34,140
And I also raised a child to tell me when she doesn't want, but she was still young. So I had

374
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,240
a little wiggle room. But then she closed that door completely and taught me a grave, humble

375
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,500
lesson. Listen to your children. The answers are right there. Listen to your children. The answers

376
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,079
are right there. They will tell you how to proceed. And I did keep the receipt for the $500 jacket,

377
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,819
and I returned it. So you just have to listen and follow your children's temperament. They will tell

378
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:04,859
you who they are, and how much you can push them, and when to back off. And that's why parenting

379
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:12,220
done consciously is a very attuned, synchronized dance between parent and child.

380
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,259
The synchronized dance. It's,

381
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,180
again, another great theme that you write about regularly. I just heard you say,

382
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,579
you know, I apologized to my daughter then. I got it wrong. It's something that I've tried to do the

383
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:29,160
many times and the many mistakes along the way, because it wasn't something that I ever, I never

384
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,180
heard parents ever, growing up ever. Is that the right thing to do, if you get it wrong, to sit

385
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,400
down and put your hand up? Yeah, but that's only level one, right?

386
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Children really don't need to hear our apology. That's a great first step. What they really need

387
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,500
is transformed behavior.

388
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:51,500
And, you know, many times we say, sorry, just for the child to say, okay, I forgive you. It's okay.

389
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,619
And then we come back with, well, if you had not, if you had not just done that, then mommy wouldn't

390
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:01,160
have raised a voice. Like if you had just listened, daddy wouldn't have lost his shit.

391
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,720
So we always trying to get our, you know, make them feel bad too. So apology is wonderful,

392
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,380
but often it's artificial and superficial. What's really important is to check your pattern.

393
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,319
Really,

394
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:22,579
go inward, inward and ask, well, why did I do that? What about my ego needed that in that

395
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:29,619
moment? What about my patterns are showing up again? And that's why in my book, The Parenting

396
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:36,980
Map, I show parents their five ego patterns and identifying that and then working on it and

397
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,599
healing it is the way to truly apologize with metamorphosis.

398
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,160
So Farley, the essence of the podcast I talk about is different leadership in different

399
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,839
settings. And as I said off the top, but to me, we are all leaders on the home front and we all

400
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,619
have this, as you said, it's this unlicensed, unregulated thing. You don't have to sit a

401
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,619
course or be regulated to be a parent. And there is no ongoing training as you described,

402
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,480
but we feel like success leaves clues. And we see people who tend to have consistently

403
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,440
positive experiences in life have these similar patterns. So I wanted to ask you,

404
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,019
a handful of questions along those lines. We feel like self-leadership, and it's probably the

405
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,039
essence of what you're talking about in every sense, isn't it? That if you're not leading

406
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,980
yourself, how can you lead your kids? What does that term mean to you, self-leadership?

407
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:38,019
Yeah, is leading your own happiness and leading your own worth. And what that means is that you

408
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:44,319
are accountable for your own successes, for your own happiness. It doesn't come from

409
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:51,480
anyone on the outside. And when you own and take accountability for your own self-directing,

410
00:33:51,740 --> 00:34:00,599
your own self-governance, you then honor it in the child. When you value your own self-initiative,

411
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:07,299
when you value your life's path for all the mistakes, for all the waywardness,

412
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:14,440
but you see how the 10 mistakes you made from the ages of 15 to 35 got you to,

413
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:22,960
where you are now at 40, you honor that wayward path. And you begin to trust that life can look

414
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,559
awry and life can look disheveled, but we're learning from it. And so actually, when you have

415
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:37,619
that self-realization, you actually push your child to own their own path. Because you know

416
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:44,500
that a person who loses 100 pounds based on their own inner motivation versus a person who loses

417
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:51,699
100 pounds for a wedding or a pageant, the difference there in sustainability is so vast

418
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:58,940
that you would rather the child find their own inner voice and hold onto it because that'll last

419
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:05,960
versus you directing the ship and you steering the way and know that it will not last. But see,

420
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,539
you have to see it operating in your own life to value your own authentic quest,

421
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,400
to value it in your child's life.

422
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,059
I would rather personally, my child be a quote unquote failure according to society's standards,

423
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,579
but do it her own way with me guiding and ushering for sure versus me directing her

424
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,539
and she's a superstar, super athlete, super achiever.

425
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,199
Yeah, it's a brilliant thought and observation. And I love the way you described that, isn't it?

426
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,519
And it is, it's such a confronting thing for parents to understand, isn't it? But it's,

427
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,380
as you said, the other part is just,

428
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:51,159
you referenced a lot of those so-called superstars that were child stars and you hear and see the

429
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:57,079
pain of the cost of that. If you could actually put that out and understand that the benefits

430
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,440
would no way stack up. We see people in different environments really conscious how they positively

431
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,800
impact others in their environment. I think about that consciously. How have you gone about that

432
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,360
from your world? Yeah, I mean, you are an emblem of your healing. So,

433
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:20,760
you are the symbol of that. And once you've healed or you are in that process, you're never

434
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:29,039
completely healed. You become this positive force everywhere you go versus being a disruptive force.

435
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,099
And, you know, many people who follow my work report, you know, these grand transformations,

436
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:43,019
which are very obvious to me. I mean, I'm not surprised because these foundational principles

437
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:44,360
are so,

438
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:52,639
well-founded and they're so, so common sense in a way, but they do require tremendous discipline

439
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,159
from the parent to move away from what culture has told us is important, right? So, conscious

440
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:05,019
parenting moves away from the matrix and the traditional paradigms and it questions everything.

441
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:11,159
Yeah, that's right. Use the term being a maverick as a parent. It definitely stacks up.

442
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,480
Creating and sharing a vision is another dimension,

443
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:18,420
leadership we see. And the conscious parenting vision is a profound one, isn't it? You are

444
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,760
disrupting, as you said, the system of what we expected and what we understood in the past. I

445
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,679
mean, how have you gone about creating and sharing that vision and doing such a good job with it?

446
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,099
Well, I do it every day. I mean, I see clients. I have a coaching institute where I train people

447
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,380
to do the work I do. I have courses. I write these books. I mean, my whole life is around

448
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,500
helping others live better and connect more.

449
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:50,559
And become more authentic. But again, I can only take people as far as I've gone myself.

450
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,760
So, I have not touched certain frontiers. I'm not going to be able to take clients over that

451
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,119
threshold. Therefore, each one of us has the power to transform other people's lives. But first,

452
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,000
we have to work on ourselves. And that leads to the next

453
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,480
dimension I want to talk to you about. Curiosity is a word we hear a lot from people when they

454
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,460
approach life with a really curious lens. And through that, they're constantly learning and

455
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,599
developing through curiosity. Does that resonate with you?

456
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:24,139
Yeah, curiosity is the key for learning. But we need to be curious to challenge

457
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:30,539
what we're listening to. We shouldn't be curious about, say, for example, how to become skinnier,

458
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:36,699
prettier, wealthier. Like, don't be curious to fall into what society says. Be curious to ask,

459
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,980
why the hell does society say that in the first place? That's the ultimate curiosity,

460
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,440
is to disrupt and deconstruct what

461
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,860
we've been raised with. What has been the intellectual food and the emotional food

462
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,199
that culture and your caregivers have been giving you since you were young? Can you look at that and

463
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:03,639
deconstruct that and don't take it at face value? Dare to challenge, why is this on my plate in the

464
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:10,380
first place? Who said that? Why is that a rule? And that is where you become really brave, right?

465
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,400
It's, if you're curious about how to do more,

466
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:22,139
what culture has told you, that's only being a follower. Real curiosity is to challenge

467
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:29,940
the systems in place and to look at them for their farce. And most of them are farcical and

468
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:37,400
lies. And they're not truly upholding of our deepest yearnings as a human being, which is

469
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,219
to be authentic, to be connected, to be seen, to be valued, not for our looks,

470
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,320
our money, our cars, our achievements. Our greatest yearning is to be seen for who it is we

471
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,800
are. And yet most of us don't allow ourselves or don't allow ourselves to see another for who it

472
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,239
is they are. We keep piling on these belief systems. So if society says, as we know, we need

473
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:11,039
to be high achieving, have a lot of money, be part of the crowd, be famous. And if we're curious

474
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,440
to do those things, meaning how can I be more famous?

475
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:21,460
How can I follow society's ways? How can I be richer? That is not the true maverick curiosity.

476
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,559
That's falling in line and following what culture says. True curiosity is to say,

477
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,780
why the hell are we talking about this in the first place? Where did this come from?

478
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,659
And to really examine the roots of all the belief systems. So a lot of my work is

479
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:40,980
challenging cultures, paradigms, and dismantling them.

480
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Yeah, it's such a brilliant why to explain curiosity.

481
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,659
As you said, isn't it? No, you're right. People have this, yeah, as you said, the following aspect

482
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,099
of wanting to be more like what the mainstream world tells us to be more like. But that's a

483
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:58,920
brilliant understanding of it. The next dimension on what it was communicating with clarity, and you

484
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,519
have got a really brilliant way that, to use an Australian term, it's like a punch in the face

485
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,000
sometimes, your language. It's right at you. Is that something you've strategically thought about?

486
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,400
Is that I'm going to be able to make an impact? I'm going to

487
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,519
challenge people right from the start? Was that always your way of communicating? Or is that a

488
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,900
fair description in your way? Yeah, no, it's not strategic. It's just

489
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:30,940
the way I see the world. And I try to be very sweet about it. I write lyrical poetry,

490
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,960
just to make it palatable. Yeah, I mean, I'm not meaning to be, I didn't even set out to be

491
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,440
revolutionary. I'm really nothing I'm saying is so revolutionary. The reason it's revolutionary,

492
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:51,019
is because we're living in an absolutely idiotic, insane way. So now if I come out with this,

493
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,099
which is to live in a sane way, I sound revolutionary. But really, what's insane is

494
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:05,940
the way we're living. All our institutions are very constricting and limiting and devoid of

495
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,099
the essence of who we are as humans. And who we are as humans, as I said, is to be connected,

496
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,400
to be seen for who it is we are, and to do.

497
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,500
So I think we're all going to have to get away with all this insanity that we're currently steeped

498
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:17,659
in.

499
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,380
And it's, you know, I love the way you say that this, it is idiotic and insane. And sometimes

500
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,000
you actually need to stop and press pause. I was just thinking, I spent a lot of time with my kids

501
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,159
at junior sport. And here in Australia, junior sport has become crazy. Like it's just we have

502
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:39,300
to have our umpires have escorts to start so a parent doesn't threaten the umpire. And then

503
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,900
I've seen the umpire escorts actually threaten the umpire. And now we've got rules where,

504
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,440
you know, we're going to have to have umpires, which is, you know, we're going to have to have

505
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,119
You can't have parents around the huddle at quarter time

506
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,539
because you can't trust parents not to do something insane.

507
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,519
And you're right.

508
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,079
We just say, okay, let's make another rule.

509
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,940
Let's, you know, ban parents and segregate.

510
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,619
Yeah, how stupid, right?

511
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,320
Right, let's have bodyguards for the umpires.

512
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,340
How about let's not call parents to the game?

513
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:04,400
Yeah.

514
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,019
And how about let's not make it a big deal?

515
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:11,539
When did junior sports become an institution

516
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:14,019
and become a whole corporate entity?

517
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,739
That's what I'm trying to say.

518
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,039
So, you know, there's this Buddhist story

519
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,719
about rescuing babies down the stream.

520
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,280
So you keep rescuing the babies down the stream,

521
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,900
but no one stops to ask,

522
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:30,159
where the hell are these babies coming from, right?

523
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:33,719
Can we kill a few down, but go up and find the source

524
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,019
so we don't keep doing this for the rest of our lives?

525
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:40,719
So that's what, you know, the umpire and the parents

526
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,420
are childish adults who have no business

527
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,579
doing this to children, but no one is realizing that.

528
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:51,760
So we keep creating all these, you know, hire more people.

529
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,159
And it's just, how stupid are we?

530
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,900
But we don't want to see that.

531
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,480
And I say that with benevolence, you know, how silly we are

532
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,599
because we're really grown up children.

533
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,699
We've not yet grown up.

534
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:08,559
I mean, I have rarely, barely met like five adults in my life.

535
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,320
Like real adults.

536
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,980
And I'm not counting myself.

537
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,900
As one of them.

538
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,760
So I'm not letting myself off the hook either.

539
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,760
But unfortunately, you know, we see on a global scale,

540
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,880
a lot of that children, as you call them,

541
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,519
are in senior, senior leadership positions, aren't they?

542
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,039
And, you know, global international leaders

543
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,019
who haven't grown up and the behavior becomes quite scary then, doesn't it?

544
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,360
Yes.

545
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,320
And then we have, you know, armies.

546
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,579
And then we have, you know, political, you know,

547
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:43,820
rules and strategies.

548
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,219
And big business meetings.

549
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,239
And really, if you really go to the top of the stream

550
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,260
to ask what the source of our misery is,

551
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,699
we will see how it was self-created out of ego.

552
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:01,059
All of it we're seeing right now is out of ego.

553
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,599
And capitalism, really.

554
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:07,639
I call parents the greatest prey to capitalism

555
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,920
because capitalism knows that parents have this ego

556
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,860
and they use us.

557
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,420
By giving us this idea that we can create these amazing children.

558
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,179
So everyone thinks that they can, but no one really can.

559
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,900
Children who are, quote unquote, super talented are outliers.

560
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,639
But we all want to have super talented children.

561
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Average is such a dirty word in the house.

562
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:33,119
Oh, my goodness.

563
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,860
We can't say we're average.

564
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,179
This is a problem.

565
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,440
Not everyone can be super, super, you know, amazing.

566
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,360
Most of us are average.

567
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,219
But no.

568
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:46,059
Every parent wants to have a supersonic child.

569
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,159
You have four children.

570
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,059
You want each one to be supersonic.

571
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,679
However, when you accept the average essence in every human being,

572
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,059
that's when you actually see the beauty of who they are.

573
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,860
But it's not based on culture standards.

574
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,059
Yeah, beautifully said.

575
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,840
Again, how important has collaboration been for you, Dr. Shefali, in your work?

576
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,539
Collaboration is the key, you know.

577
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,039
I mean, there's nothing I could have done.

578
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:22,099
Every achievement I've achieved at, I can tell you who helped me.

579
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,119
And the whole thread of how I got here.

580
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,679
I know piece by piece at every inflection point who helped me.

581
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,219
And so I bow down to being connected.

582
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,619
We are humans in relationship.

583
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,719
And to pretend that we're not.

584
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:40,619
And that's...

585
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,420
That's for the good and the bad, yes.

586
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,699
But to pretend that we're not and that we can do this on our own

587
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:49,039
is, again, our ignorance talking.

588
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,659
Shefali, two final questions.

589
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,699
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

590
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,260
Well, I think spiritually, you know, in terms of wisdom,

591
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:01,460
I follow the teachings of the Buddha.

592
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,420
I'm not Buddhist, but I just follow his teachings.

593
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,139
And if he even existed.

594
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:10,139
And so that's...

595
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,539
That's been my greatest North Star.

596
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:20,639
But I think in terms of, you know, mortals, I think my mother, you know,

597
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:26,199
just watching how she has been a human in my life, my dear, you know, friends.

598
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,860
I've had so many great, amazing relationships.

599
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,619
My child has been my leader.

600
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:34,800
I mean, bar none, really, in the past 20 years.

601
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,920
I've been a servant of her growth and following her lead.

602
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,860
And I cannot tell you how much I've learned.

603
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,340
You know, every book is inspired by her audacity and her unique authenticity.

604
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,800
And so it can be for every human being if they are willing to allow their children to be their awakeners.

605
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,400
Shefali, you mentioned your mother first, instinctively.

606
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:04,460
Did she have an essence of conscious parenting when you grew up?

607
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:06,980
She says she didn't.

608
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,840
But I think I just hit the jackpot.

609
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:18,900
She is just really the most open, you know, non-artificial human being.

610
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,719
Just so authentic and honest and real.

611
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,880
And she never pushed me to become anything.

612
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,539
She's constantly surprised that I can do anything right now, which sounds like an insult.

613
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:36,679
But it's actually so refreshing and liberating because anything I do, she's so thrilled about, you know.

614
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:39,099
So you would wonder what expectations she had.

615
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:45,519
But it's because she had such a low bar for me that I could do anything, right?

616
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,780
It gave me such freedom.

617
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:53,760
And many parents talk about, well, shouldn't you have a high bar for your children so they can reach that bar?

618
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,099
I go, no.

619
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,300
Your high bar should be that they follow their lead.

620
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,159
The high bar should be that they listen to their own wisdom.

621
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,239
The high bar should be that they follow their authentic truth.

622
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,079
Then they get to create the bar in terms of success.

623
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:13,780
But, you know, when we say a high bar, we just mean, you know, achievement and money.

624
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,760
Yeah, absolutely.

625
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,320
And one of your great lines is one of the goals of parenting should be to make yourself irrelevant.

626
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:26,219
And it sounds like that's your essence of your mom in lots of ways, isn't it?

627
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:28,300
She handed the reins over to you.

628
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:33,300
In the spirit of collaboration, if I can get that word out, if you could collaborate with anyone.

629
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,619
You've had some amazing collaboration.

630
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,539
I mentioned Oprah Winfrey off the top.

631
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,039
And clearly that was.

632
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:43,900
It must have been an amazing support to have her back your work.

633
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,880
Have you thought, God, to really take conscious parenting or any part of your life?

634
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,460
Has it been someone you thought that's who I'd love to collaborate with?

635
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,880
You know, not to toot any horn.

636
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:08,880
I had the Dalai Lama, Eckhart Tolle, Oprah Winfrey as my top three people that before I started this journey to, you know, have them write a forward or support my work.

637
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,840
And none of them are parents.

638
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,559
Yeah, mind you.

639
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,119
But they were such wisdom teachers for me.

640
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,260
And I've been so blessed because I got to connect with all three of them.

641
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:22,260
And they supported me.

642
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,940
So after these three, I don't know whether I need any more.

643
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm very sated and very blessed.

644
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,019
And I'm not greedy anymore.

645
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,340
You know, I got the Dalai Lama.

646
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,340
Then I wanted Eckhart.

647
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,139
I got Eckhart.

648
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:35,900
Then I wanted Oprah.

649
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:36,780
I got Oprah.

650
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,619
I wanted Oprah again.

651
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,300
I got her again.

652
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,079
I wanted her again.

653
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,079
I got her again.

654
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,099
So now I'm just not greedy.

655
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,559
I'm not so greedy anymore.

656
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:47,260
But if you said, no, come on, you could get Oprah again.

657
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:47,880
Would you want her?

658
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,420
I'd be like, of course, I want her again.

659
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:51,619
She's my ultimate.

660
00:50:51,880 --> 00:51:00,679
She's the ultimate embodiment of somebody who is trying to live authentically a life of service.

661
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,980
She has the whole package, in my opinion.

662
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,300
I did say final question, but I can't help but ask the Dalai Lama.

663
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,280
I mean, did he?

664
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,780
Did he, in essence, get your work?

665
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,960
Did he really understand what you're trying to spread?

666
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,360
Yeah, I don't know how much he understood, but he did give me a foreword for my first book.

667
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,940
But yeah, I don't know whether he really read my book even, but I'm hoping that his people,

668
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,460
you know how these things are.

669
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:33,219
But I was so blessed because getting his foreword was very hard to do back then.

670
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,500
I don't know how it is now.

671
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:38,360
You know, and Eckhart Tolle is one of our leading wisdom teachers.

672
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,539
And he's a friend.

673
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:42,320
And I look up to him so much.

674
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,820
And really, a lot of my blessings have come from his wisdom.

675
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,340
Dr. Shefali, really appreciate your time.

676
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:56,920
In my mind, it is the ultimate leadership story to pass on and to start with self and to understand that if we,

677
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,719
as you say, to heal yourself and to be on that journey, that's the best example you can have.

678
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,719
And so much wisdom in the letting go and celebrating our kids for whatever they are

679
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:08,340
and however they are.

680
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,920
It's such a profound message to pass on.

681
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:12,559
I really appreciate you taking the time.

682
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:12,900
Thank you.

683
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,760
Thank you.

684
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,380
And I think my book, The Parenting Map, is available.

685
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:21,179
But that's what people need to read if they want to become conscious parents.

686
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,920
Thank you for listening to the Empowering Leaders podcast, powered by temper, a mattress like no other.
