00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:12,070
Well, I hope you enjoyed this conversation with the iconic Australian, Stephanie Alexander,

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,570
whose influence on educating Australians on the passion for eating well and living a good life

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,269
through good food is profound. I loved her thoughts on energy, passion and enthusiasm,

4
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:28,269
trumping almost everything else in life. And how educating through example is so much more

5
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:33,189
powerful and changing behaviour than lecturing people on how they should eat. It's iconic

6
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:38,369
leaders like Stephanie Alexander that inspire the work that we do at Alita. Love you to check

7
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:42,630
out our bespoke Alita Connect program where we bring together diverse leaders from around the

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,590
globe, people like Stephanie Alexander and her passion and enthusiasm for the world of food,

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,829
with sports leaders, leaders from social venture and the arts into these groups of five or six

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,770
people to connect, to learn, to share and to collaborate in ways that perhaps they haven't

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,869
done before. Love you to check it out. Head to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call.

12
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,109
We'd love to jump on a call with you and see.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,230
If you want to start your journey with us and Alita Connect. Huge thanks as always and every

14
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,730
week to Jason Nicholas and the team at Temper Bedding, a mattress like no other. We really

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,890
appreciate their support in bringing incredible leaders like Stephanie Alexander to the table.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,609
We know success leaves clues and leaders like Stephanie all value their sleep and understand

17
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,670
the importance of sleep for a better life. Investing in a temper mattress is something

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,349
that will change your sleep and change your life for the better.

19
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:39,170
Stephanie Alexander is regarded as one of Australia's great food educators. Her reputation

20
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,489
has been earned through her 30 years as an owner chef in several restaurants, as the author of 18

21
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:50,629
influential books and hundreds of articles about food matters and for her groundbreaking work

22
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,829
and creating the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation, for which she was made an

23
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,150
officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her extraordinary contribution. Kitchen Garden

24
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,150
Program is represented in more than 11 countries. Stephanie Alexander is regarded as one of the

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,409
primary schools and in more than 1,000 schools and learning centres Australia-wide. Stephanie,

26
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,469
it's a great pleasure to meet you and congratulations on an incredible life of

27
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,949
success and what a great legacy you've got. Thank you, Luke.

28
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:22,370
It's great to see you. You've been an incredible leader and pioneer in educating Australians

29
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,050
in your belief that good food is essential to living well. Stephanie, what does good food

30
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,009
look and sound like for you? I think, what does good food sound like?

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,129
Well, I really do think that it is one of life's most accessible pleasures and joys. And it is

32
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:48,550
always a great sadness to me that so many people, for various reasons, don't agree with me.

33
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:56,289
They find it hard. They find it difficult. It makes them very anxious. And I guess my reason

34
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:02,210
for almost everything I do is to convince people that not only is it a beautiful and wonderful and

35
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,969
yummy thing.

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,250
But it really is very accessible to everybody.

37
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,150
And what an amazing storyline that you've had in sharing that. And for a lot of people,

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,129
it is the most stressful thing of the day, isn't it, Stephanie, around

39
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:22,770
mealtime and trying to do that in a healthy and comfortable way for the family. And I think your

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,530
language has been brilliant around sharing simple techniques to make that accessible.

41
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,110
Has that been your mission in lots of ways? Well, it certainly hasn't been. Health has not

42
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,129
been top of mind.

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,990
I've been on a list of things, which doesn't mean that I don't value eating well and doing things

44
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:46,189
that are great for one's body. But I just prefer to feel that what is important is the communication

45
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:54,229
that happens between friends and families, the conversations you have, the opening of your mind

46
00:03:54,229 --> 00:04:01,569
to different possibilities, being aware of different ways of doing things. But pleasure,

47
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,550
pleasure, pleasure.

48
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,270
Right at the centre of it, because I really believe you don't change anyone's behaviour about

49
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:14,330
anything if you wave your finger at them and say, don't do this, don't do that. But you will change

50
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,750
their behaviour if they have an experience which is hands-on, in the case of the children in the

51
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,370
kitchen garden. And their energy and their curiosity are as involved as their taste buds.

52
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:32,689
Yeah, I love the way that you frame that, Stephanie. Can I ask you about the food education

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,129
part?

54
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:39,930
I agree with you. All the research says waving your finger and trying to scold someone into

55
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,250
changing behaviour doesn't work. But in preparation for this, Devin, I was thinking about an occasion,

56
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,470
my wife and I were at a friend's house and the kids were bouncing off the walls. They were young

57
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,350
and they'd been eating Froot Loops. And the mum, who was a really well-educated and smart lady,

58
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,170
had turned to us and said, I'm glad that they've got some fruit in them today. And you look at a

59
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,129
box of that fruit and you're like, oh, that's good. I'm glad that they've got some fruit in them today.

60
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,709
And you look at that alleged breakfast cereal and you effectively have given the kids a kilo

61
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:12,970
of sugar. And you wonder why they're bouncing off the walls and a touch out of control. Were

62
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,709
you surprised sometimes by the lack of understanding of what good food actually is?

63
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,589
I am surprised. And there's lots and lots of reasons we could go on about that or I could

64
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,149
go on about that for hours and hours, which I'm sure you don't want me to. And it does seem to me

65
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,009
that there has been a bit of a thing with

66
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:42,430
the Anglo-Saxon culture. It has not been one that has incorporated the pleasures of growing

67
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,970
your own food and encouraging your young ones to come out in the garden and help you

68
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:56,089
pick a tomato or dig for a potato. So share in that sense of the magic of growth. And that

69
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:01,670
all sounds very airy-fairy and arty, but it's really how a lot of people in the world live,

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,990
that they are involved.

71
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,550
They're involved in producing at least some of their food. And if they don't grow it themselves,

72
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,470
they choose to purchase it in a place where they're talking to people who understand what

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,850
they're buying. And they can say, are these the most luscious pears you've got? Or the person,

74
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,189
the man or the woman selling it will say, this is the best time of the year for artichokes.

75
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,470
So you're actually, you are communicating and you're communicating enthusiasm as well as

76
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,029
knowledge.

77
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:40,490
And when that's missing, you know, you do have this big lack. And it does astonish me that

78
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,750
somebody who's had some sort of reasonable general education can either believe the words

79
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,629
of the advertisers, which we know are always geared to making a sale, rather than using their

80
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:54,550
common sense.

81
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,730
Yeah, it is. And it becomes a huge issue. And I won't get too hung up on this point, Stephanie,

82
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,990
but it is a bit of a passion of mine as well.

83
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,709
And fortunate enough to, you know, my mother was at the market every day. And, you know,

84
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,050
as a kid, you wanted, you know, perhaps what some of the other kids were getting. But, you know,

85
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,009
she had a really clear sense of health and my beautiful wife and the amount of care that goes

86
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:24,430
into the nutrition and the meals that we enjoy on a nightly basis in that community. But then

87
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,589
you go to the kids' party. And I know there's a place for this. And you look at the table and you

88
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,970
go, that is food you would never dream of consuming yourself.

89
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:39,509
It's full of preservatives and additives and colourings. And I know there is a place for that

90
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:45,069
in a small space. But it seems, as you said, that Anglo-Saxon culture has been around food that

91
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,629
doesn't even actually look like food in the end. It's become a bit of a challenge, hasn't it?

92
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,410
Well, this whole business of, you know, never leaving the table with anything left on your

93
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,569
plate or, you know, we'll bring it out again the next meal. I hope that doesn't exist anymore.

94
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,990
But, you know, as opposed to the

95
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,589
sort of tables that probably you have regularly, and I certainly have regularly, where you set out

96
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:14,470
food on platters and the children, you know, they don't necessarily like every single thing that's

97
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,569
there. But what they do see is the people whom they respect and love are diving into all these

98
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,410
things so that even if they decide at the age of four, they don't really like olives. It doesn't

99
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:32,470
mean that they say, well, you know, if I see an olive, I'll faint. It just means the palate's

100
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,350
developed as they get older and you've got a good grounding. And I always think, you know,

101
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,269
if you come from a family where meals often end with the fruit bowl, you know, lovely nectarine

102
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:49,970
or a pear or something, you're much more likely to have children who will be fruit lovers for life

103
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,330
and will always have that as part of their diet, not because they're being told it's healthy,

104
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,070
nutritious, full of vitamins, but because they like it. And I love your point is that the example

105
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,450
is always the way, isn't it? What they say is always the way, isn't it? And I think that's

106
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,929
what they end up taking on board, isn't it? You can lecture all you like, but if the behaviours

107
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:13,549
they witness are different, it's always going to be a challenge. And the Stephanie Alexander

108
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:18,470
Kitchen Garden Project in schools is an incredible legacy, as I said off the top. And I got to see

109
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:24,629
it firsthand at the primary school that my kids went to and saw that, you know, the kids grow

110
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:30,429
and harvest their own food and prepare and share fresh meals and, you know, delicious food that

111
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,389
was prepared. And I think your language is saying,

112
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,750
can we then show them and teach them positive food habits for life? You must be incredibly proud of

113
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,950
where that project's got to. I certainly am. And of course,

114
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,190
during the COVID years, we had all, everybody was a bit mucked around and many schools found it

115
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,110
difficult to keep going during those years. After all, there were many schools that were actually

116
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:01,070
physically closed. But as soon as life started to resume, those kitchen gardens have, oh,

117
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,409
I can't say all of them. But

118
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:09,009
many of them that I know of have just picked up the pieces and rebuilt and re-nourished the soil

119
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:16,690
and away they've gone again. And the pleasure and the enjoyment that is on, that is in evidence

120
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,970
whenever I visit one of those schools, if I'm feeling a bit down in the dumps, I come away

121
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,590
saying, what they're doing is really important and it works. These kids are so excited about

122
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,450
what they're doing. And some of them develop the most amazing knife skills and all the other

123
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,830
sorts of actual motor skills and interest in food generally.

124
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,070
Yeah. And as you said earlier, the great Italian families that I grew up with

125
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,289
always had the veggie garden going and always brought fresh produce and would

126
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:54,409
come over with whatever was growing in season. And that culture, they brought beautifully to

127
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:59,570
Australia. But you're right, there's an element that have grown up with not even understanding

128
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:00,970
what a potato...

129
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,210
The potato milk comes from or how it is. And so what you've done is such a profound

130
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,929
thing to educate so many kids to understand. And then often, isn't it, when it's prepared that way

131
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,870
and you get to taste something that you've grown and eaten yourself, it's a pretty special

132
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,549
presentation, isn't it, when it all works?

133
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:24,470
And they feel very, very proud. It's a way of increasing self-esteem. It's a program which

134
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,350
is utterly inclusive. Every child, no matter what their abilities in any other area,

135
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,450
can be involved in this.

136
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:39,370
Every kid seems to love digging holes or knocking bamboo poles in the soil to support a plant.

137
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,570
And they certainly all love to be allowed to use a knife because often at home,

138
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,269
the parents freak out if they touch a knife, whereas we show them how to use a knife properly.

139
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,929
Stephanie, your fifth book, The Cook's Companion, has become a genuine Bible for

140
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:00,889
chefs and cooks and food lovers and really everyone. Over 500,000 copies sold since it

141
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,309
was first published in 1996.

142
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,529
It's a brilliant success. Why do you think it's resonated with so many people?

143
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:15,610
Because it's clear. Because I haven't, as a former librarian, I'm very good on the A to Z.

144
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:24,450
And I knew that that was a really supremely simple method of organization.

145
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,929
So it was based on the produce. It was clear. I tried to think of every possible thing that

146
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:38,889
would be concerning people. How do I store it? How do I know it's a good one? Does it only come at

147
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,649
a certain time of the year? And then there's those little marginal notes a lot of people

148
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:50,210
absolutely love where they're not recipes, they're ideas. Put a handful of walnuts with

149
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,809
a something or other and toss it with a bit of olive oil and put it on a plate. Now, that's the

150
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:00,289
sort of cooking that good cooks love to do because it's just a challenge to you every night. I open

151
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,909
the fridge door. Oh, yes.

152
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:06,009
I've got that bit of celeriac I've even used. Right. Okay. Out it comes.

153
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:13,750
Yeah. It's brilliant. And as you said, sometimes the best genius is the simplicity, isn't it? And

154
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,389
for you then to have trained chefs and cooks who have that alongside them at the same time,

155
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,370
and obviously your history, you went back and you said you started as a librarian,

156
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:29,629
trained as a librarian. Did you dream at that young age that life in food as a business was

157
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,830
a possibility or did that just emerge?

158
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,950
As you got older? Well, it was always my great interest,

159
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:43,129
but it didn't occur to me or to my parents that a life in food was on the horizon. The general

160
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,710
feeling when I was a teenager, when I was 18, 19 and going to university was that you got trained

161
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:55,250
for something vocationally and you did it. But in recreationally, even when I was 17, 18,

162
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:01,490
the thing I loved to do most was to cook for other people. So I managed to do both together for a

163
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:01,850
while.

164
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:07,870
And then the sort of the feeling in the society changed in Melbourne, and there seemed to be a

165
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:15,009
possibility for people to have a go themselves. And so the first BYO restaurants in Melbourne

166
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:22,870
were run by people who were genuine food enthusiasts. Almost none of them, and I probably

167
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:30,970
could say none of them had had any formal training, but they had a lot of love for lovely food and for

168
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,330
helping.

169
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,929
And I think that's something that I've learned over the years. I think that's something that I've

170
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:33,990
learned over the years.

171
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,190
And now we sit here, Stephanie, and, you know, the Kitchen Garden program we've spoken about and what

172
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,690
you've done to educate Australians over so many years, but they're about to make a movie of you

173
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:51,570
and your experience in 1997 in Tuscany in Italy with your great friend, another food legend in

174
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,970
Maggie Beer, taking Australian food lovers and running cooking classes in that part of the world.

175
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,929
Can I ask you what it feels like to about to have a movie made after you? And can you tell me a bit

176
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:01,610
about your life?

177
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,909
Well, I think it's a great experience. I think it's a great experience. I think it's a great

178
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:01,990
experience.

179
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,509
It's a lifelong friendship.

180
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,009
There's not many details yet, Luke, and I think it's really still on the drawing board.

181
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,450
Actually, in the next few days, going to spend a day or so with Maggie. One of the things we'll be

182
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:22,769
talking about is how far this project has got. It was great. It was very funny when they first put

183
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,210
it to us. We both thought it was hilarious and we couldn't believe that it was going to happen.

184
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,070
And we still don't believe it's going to happen.

185
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,610
It does seem as if the producer...

186
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,710
The producer seems to think it's going to happen. So I don't know much more than that now,

187
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,289
excepting that it is rather fun.

188
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,370
Yeah, it's cool. I was reading a bit of the plot and understanding a bit, you know,

189
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,909
the two books emerged out of that trip to Italy. And I'm fascinated. And I'm reading from the

190
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,929
producer who's had some great success in other Netflix shows as well, but talking about this

191
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:00,409
great friendship as well. And can you tell us about that, your lifelong friendship with Maggie Beer?

192
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,210
Well, I think we both found ourselves in restaurants at a time when, as I said before,

193
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:14,509
these BYO restaurants or owner-operated restaurants were just starting to happen in Australia.

194
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:22,029
And I think we would both admit that we had bitten off, I hate to say more than we can chew,

195
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,509
because we in fact chewed it quite successfully. But it was a strain. And Maggie was a couple of

196
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,590
years behind me in experience at that time. And I think we both found ourselves in restaurants at a

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:41,590
point. And we got together at some group gathering of young cooks. And she and I found that we both

198
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:49,610
shared a whole lot of feelings about food and about growing things. And look, we just hit it

199
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,350
off. And we've been hitting it off ever since. And the custody thing was really because we had had

200
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,450
a holiday in Umbria two years prior.

201
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:09,630
And we had loved it so much, loved the Italian way of life, the Italian way of food. And we kept

202
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,670
saying to each other, how can we come back again? But we've got businesses to run. How can we do it?

203
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,970
And so we spent a lot of time mulling over thoughts. And then the idea came that we would

204
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,930
take people to Tuscany. We would not be saying we are great Italian cooks. We are saying,

205
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,569
come with us and let's explore what it is.

206
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:39,509
That makes Italian food and way of life so very, very special and so appealing and have a good time

207
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:46,130
at the same time. Can I ask you this question, Stephanie? I know your love of French cuisine

208
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,170
and the French love of food as well from a young age. And you've spent many years going back and

209
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,130
forth to France and clearly Tuscany. And you've traveled around the world. Can you share with us

210
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,970
one of your great memorable food experiences from your travels?

211
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:07,829
Oh God, there've been so many. I mean, my heart probably still belongs in France. Although

212
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:16,869
if I can say my special occasion country is France. I also love Italian food, but it's

213
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:23,089
those two countries have a very special place for me. And I was fortunate enough during my

214
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:28,529
restaurant years to be able to visit a great number of the very finest French restaurants

215
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:31,029
at the time. This is in the 80s probably.

216
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:41,630
And it was fascinating. It was fascinating to observe how just the systems, just the systems

217
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:49,069
were very important to understand because without system, you can't achieve these things. And I was

218
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:54,829
very, very, very conscious of the systems that were in operation in these grand restaurants.

219
00:18:54,829 --> 00:19:01,349
I had one at a restaurant called Trois Rheaux in the country, in the regional,

220
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:09,049
and I stayed there for nine days. And I was given the full run of the place and stayed in the kitchen

221
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:15,450
from early in the morning till the last service watching what happened. And I learned such a lot.

222
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:21,029
And one of the things I learned was that a grand restaurant like that, it has to have systems

223
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:27,309
because it is a very hierarchical situation, which wasn't necessarily what we had in Melbourne.

224
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,190
But I could see how things were made possible by having

225
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:36,910
specific systems and responsibilities and people responding to this person and that person.

226
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:46,309
So it was a bit about leadership. And the food was fabulous. So out of a very systematic approach

227
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:51,670
came some really wonderful results. And that leadership you've brought back

228
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:58,230
to Australia and in your education, and you go to, if you're lucky enough to spend some time

229
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,349
in France, you see food as a way of life, isn't it? And you often hear about,

230
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:08,950
the French way of eating, it's such a pleasurable experience, isn't it? Every meal and really

231
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,309
taking time to sit down and connect and all the things you've spoken about, haven't you, around

232
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,589
community and they eat beautifully, the French, but they don't seem to overindulge either. Is that

233
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:26,069
a fair snapshot? Well, I think that's right. They can remember as a greedy Australian

234
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:31,269
and one of my very, when I was a student in France, living there for a year and in my early

235
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:37,589
months of living there, you would go to a little tiny country cafe, which was always had a respect

236
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:45,089
for the food, but wasn't fancy. And when it came to cheese, this is very definitely before the

237
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:50,190
eighties. This is more like late sixties. When the cheese, the cheese board would be just put

238
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:59,390
on the table and the waiter would walk away. Now the greedy Australian would say, my God,

239
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,430
all of this.

240
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,190
A piece of camembert, bit of this and bit of that. And then you would probably later on feel

241
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,930
extremely, well, not sick, but you'd feel very, as if you'd eaten a huge dinner, but you'd watch

242
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,150
the French at the next table. They'd still get the full cheese board put on the table and they

243
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,769
would look it over whilst they were having a conversation and they'd say to themselves,

244
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:28,170
I think I'll have the brie tonight. And they would cut a modest slice. That's all they wanted.

245
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,170
There was a sense of an understanding.

246
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,430
When moderation was okay. So it balanced moderation, which people talk about all the

247
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:42,230
time. Again, it's something you model, is being modelled for you at home.

248
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:48,990
And I just, yeah, beautifully said, I want to go back to just that final, not final,

249
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:52,529
but the thought of mine again, and you come back, as you said, to the Anglo-Saxon way

250
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:57,730
of eating and we're bombarded our kids with these fast food advertising every day and meals are

251
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,049
quick and cheap and clearly lacking.

252
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,789
Nutrition. I mean, you've done an enormous amount to re-educate back the other way. Is it a fair

253
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,750
fight, Stephanie? Because it's so overwhelming sometimes, isn't it? How, particularly in low

254
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,750
socioeconomic areas in Australia, the kids, that's all they see when they hear and experience food.

255
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:30,130
Well, it is a battle. I don't think it's a fair battle. I think my answer would be

256
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,349
probably,

257
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:38,430
probably need to hope that this generation of young people that we're helping learn about

258
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,890
lovely food will take those lessons into their own life and will model a different sort of behaviour

259
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,710
because they will understand how to make a simple soup. They will understand how you can

260
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,109
have dinner with three vegetables and a small amount of protein. Now, they do understand that

261
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:00,210
because that's what they're actually doing. They're practising that all the time.

262
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:06,809
I don't know that I can feel very confident about changing the behaviour of our adult

263
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:13,049
population. I think that they've got their own antecedents. They either come from a country

264
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:22,289
where eating is a joyous experience and moderate portions are the norm, or they don't. And I don't

265
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:28,950
think I can help. But I do think the fact that our young kids are bombarded with so many highly

266
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,089
common...

267
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:37,769
You know, so many colourful, so many appealing advertisements, it's asking a lot of a young child

268
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:43,769
not to be influenced by this. And as we know, pester power is alive and well in the supermarket

269
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:50,970
queue. I don't... I agree with you. A little indulgence now and then is of no consequence

270
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:57,250
at all. But you certainly don't want to get into the habit of that's what everybody eats every day.

271
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,950
And I see this. Stephanie Alexander,

272
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,569
that story is a great leadership story in Australia. And what you've done for food

273
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:09,589
education, as I said off the top, is an amazing contribution. And Stephanie, I've loved the

274
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:15,150
opportunity to sit down with someone from the arts or from a sporting world or a business world. And

275
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,269
you've probably combined a lot of those passions. And we see these... Really, what we see are some

276
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,170
success-lose-clues type of dimensions in what great leadership looks like. And I'd like to ask

277
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,049
you about some of those patterns that we've seen. Starting, Stephanie, with this idea of

278
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:34,589
self-leadership. We don't think anyone can lead someone else, as you've done so beautifully,

279
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,730
without an idea of what it means to lead themselves. Does that resonate with you?

280
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,390
I think probably the quality that has been

281
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:49,650
paramount in the decisions I've made and the people who've influenced me

282
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:58,930
is genuine enthusiasm. Yes, competence in the area that I'm interested in, but more particularly,

283
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,410
enthusiasm.

284
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:05,869
And an ability to communicate that enthusiasm and the beauty of whatever it is that they're

285
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:12,950
talking about. I can remember an English teacher in my very early years in high school who was just

286
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:20,890
so inspiring. I can remember another, even a maths teacher, and I'm appalling at maths, but

287
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:27,890
she gave the enthusiasm that it was something that was worth persevering with. And at university,

288
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,730
there were one or two lecturers that I...

289
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:35,029
I used to love the lectures because they communicated in their own love of the material.

290
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:39,690
And I think that that sort of enthusiasm is incredibly engaging.

291
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:47,150
No doubt. You've shared your love of all things food in such an incredible way. We see leaders

292
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,549
are really conscious of how they positively impact others in the environment on a daily basis. And I

293
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,950
read about you and your restaurants and the amount of people that came through that were trained

294
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,029
beautifully and went on and opened their doors to the world. And I think that's a really important

295
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:00,349
thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing.

296
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:06,829
restaurants or then had impact elsewhere. Can you share with us your passion for impacting

297
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,430
others in the environments that you've worked in?

298
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:18,130
Well, just this last weekend, I went to be the guest of honour at Annie Smith's restaurant in

299
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:26,529
Trentham, Victoria to celebrate Mother's Day. And she was having this lunch and said to the

300
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,690
room full of people, which was very lovely,

301
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,710
Stephanie is my kitchen mother. She everything I know, she told me, well, that is absolutely not

302
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:41,690
true. But it was lovely to hear her say that. And she had asked me to design the menu, which she

303
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:49,890
then cooked. So that is she is one of my very, very special foodie friends. But there are a lot

304
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:56,690
of people who have worked with me and alongside me. And I think I would reiterate that what they've

305
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,150
got for me is

306
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:06,730
very positive modelling, because I really do live what I say, you know, I just don't eat fast food,

307
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,430
because it doesn't seem to me to be as interesting as the food I can cook myself. That doesn't mean

308
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:18,009
that I don't eat a bit of street food here and there. But I do like sushi. But you know, I'm not

309
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:25,809
tempted by the packaged product when I can go home and make something much more beautiful. So I've

310
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:28,569
watched people go on to run their own restaurants.

311
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:36,730
And it's over such a long time now. Often we've lost touch. But when I meet people or I go into a

312
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:42,009
restaurant, there's often somebody who comes up and says, I worked for you at such and such. Now

313
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,630
that includes, of course, the dishwashers and the front of house staff. And I don't always remember

314
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:54,009
their names. But they remember the experience as positive and enthusiastic. And so you know, I stick

315
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:58,529
with it. Enthusiasm is sweeps all before it.

316
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,230
And it's a great, great message to share. I appreciate you doing that. You've had some

317
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,950
big vision ahead of your time, as you said, running restaurants in Melbourne,

318
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:14,970
before it was even thought possible for people that didn't have formal training and your vision

319
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,930
in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program as well. We see leaders are really conscious about

320
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,849
how they go about creating that vision and then sharing it. Can you give us an insight into how

321
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:28,470
you've done that? Well, I think the risk of repeating myself,

322
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:36,730
just that I live it. And so when I'm working with somebody in the kitchen, I can't help sharing with

323
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,230
them a bigger picture. You know, if we're chopping up leeks, I might say, goodness, I remember having

324
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,890
this beautiful, this beautiful pasta dish or this beautiful pastry, which was full of leeks that

325
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:55,309
have been softly stewed in butter for about 15 minutes, then drained and then mixed with such.

326
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:57,789
And the person who's chopping the leeks,

327
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,130
just hears that it's a sort of part of it's another track going through their mind.

328
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,410
But if it happens every day and a different, different product every day,

329
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:17,809
they do get a different sense of the possibilities of food. And a lot of the people that I influenced

330
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:22,970
positively, I'd like to think they were young people full of enthusiasm, but they often

331
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,650
didn't have very strong food backgrounds. They were interested and they became,

332
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:36,490
very competent, but they took on a lot of knowledge and they understood that food was

333
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:45,490
more than just nutrients. You're not just absorbing calories. You're eating people's stories. And

334
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,890
that's probably not a great answer. No, it's a great answer. And I'm pondering

335
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:56,009
because I can hear my mother's words in your language. I feel very fortunate. When you look

336
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:58,329
back and you realize that was the care that was put into...

337
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,009
The meals, you didn't necessarily appreciate and understand that when you were growing up,

338
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:06,490
but you look back now and say, as you've said so beautifully, that has flowed through,

339
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,690
I hope, to our kids as well.

340
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,730
And I hope I should have made a mention of my own mother because she was an extraordinarily

341
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:22,289
strong influence on my entire life, not just the cooking, because she really also really

342
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:28,490
cared about it. And it was terribly important to her. Her main creative outlet was cooking.

343
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,829
It was, what are we going to eat tonight? What shall I plant in the garden? It just was

344
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:38,910
something that, as you say, you don't know at the time. You're not aware at the time of how

345
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,430
much you're absorbing, but it's all there. Stephanie, we see curiosity as a common

346
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:51,089
trait and a word that comes up a lot in these conversations. And curious leaders then use

347
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:55,730
that as their way to keep growing and evolving. How have you tapped into curiosity?

348
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,329
Stephanie Kempf Well, I think from my

349
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,490
decades of the restaurant, through reading and through traveling and experiencing and tasting,

350
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,710
I feel I've stopped doing that to some extent. I just feel

351
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,730
at this advanced age, I'm just letting it all cure a bit in the brain now.

352
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:25,130
I want to ask you about the next dimension, communicating with clarity. You're 18 books

353
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,329
in, I think, and a new one about to be released, which I'd love you to tell us about.

354
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:28,470
Stephanie Kempf

355
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:36,089
If you can. But the communication that you have is a very clear and distinct way. And you mentioned

356
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:41,289
that in The Cook's Companion, the simplicity of it is the genius. Can you tell us about how you've

357
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,910
communicated your message? Stephanie Kempf

358
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:49,410
Well, writing, I love writing. I love words. I'd love to find another way of, I mean,

359
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,970
I can't write a novel. I just know that I can't do that. But I do enjoy very much the writing. So

360
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,309
the books have usually... Stephanie Kempf

361
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:03,589
It's usually been a task associated with pleasure, a lot of hard work, but it's been

362
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:09,789
pleasurable hard work. And the next book is called Fresh, and it is inspired by the work

363
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:16,690
of the Kitchen Garden Foundation, and hopefully enlivened by little stories about what happens

364
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:22,549
in particular schools. So it's also seen as being a way of families seeing how they can produce

365
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:28,150
lovely dishes, which their kids can help with. So it's meant to be for families,

366
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:36,170
and to inspire families to cook some of the things that have been cooked successfully by young people.

367
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,950
Dr. Tim Jackson What a great concept. I can't

368
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,049
wait to see it, and a great continuation of the brilliant work that you've done. And I love that

369
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:48,750
you've started in primary schools. I know there's a Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden secondary

370
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,930
program now as well, but capturing the kids when they're that creative and open-minded is

371
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,269
a brilliant way to go about it. Collaboration is something we see leaders now really,

372
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,109
conscious of, Stephanie, how they collaborate, how often they do. How important has collaboration

373
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:05,029
been for you? Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden

374
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:10,829
Well, as a not-for-profit foundation, of course, it has been, I'm not sure if that's exactly what

375
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:17,009
you mean, but we have had to collaborate. We have had to look for funders. We've had to look for

376
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:22,549
people who can support us because, of course, none of these things happen without people being

377
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:28,289
paid salaries and so on. So we've had a sort of a checker,

378
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:33,910
career with government, both state and federal. Sometimes we've had some positive help. Sometimes

379
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:40,230
we've had years when we haven't had positive help. We have a social partnership with Coles,

380
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:46,490
which has been very, very helpful for us. We have got philanthropic partners. We have

381
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:53,730
corporate partners. And all of those, we're very, very grateful to all of that assistance,

382
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,269
because without it, the foundation could not possibly exist. So,

383
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:02,150
and I think that story would be very familiar to anyone who's involved in a not-for-profit

384
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:10,530
organisation. It can keep you awake at night and does. But I think that anyone who really helps us,

385
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:16,730
we try to make sure that we take them to several schools pretty early on in our association. And

386
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,010
that gives a major reinforcement that they can see what they're helping is important.

387
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,449
And for you to hit the targets that you aim for is incredible, isn't it? To be

388
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,289
represented in an organisation that's so important to you.

389
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:33,230
Over a thousand schools is an incredible achievement. And no doubt, as you said,

390
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:39,670
with that collaborative approach, and it's not an easy sector to be successful in. And you've

391
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:44,590
done it with great skill. Can I ask you, Stephanie, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

392
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,409
Probably my mother. And she was such a shy person. She would be astonished to hear me say that.

393
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:57,510
I just somehow absorbed all the values that mattered to her.

394
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:04,869
And as I've got older, understood why some of them were so important. Probably when I was

395
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:11,389
10, 12 years old, I didn't realise what I was seeing when I saw the way she arranged flowers,

396
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,510
or the way that she chose beautiful things to put on the table. They were not expensive,

397
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,329
but just a lovely vase or a beautiful bowl. All of that was very, very important to her. And it's

398
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:27,949
now very, very important to me. So that, you know, the preparation for a meal is multifaceted.

399
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:35,369
I think I'll put that on that green plate. Sounds mad, doesn't it? But it's got to be something.

400
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:44,269
I've seen it. I feel lucky to have been around that sort of preparation and the passion for it.

401
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:49,730
And, you know, we grew up in the hospitality game as well, in the pub space. And to see,

402
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,510
you know, that care and the beauty of bringing people together is, again, something I feel,

403
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,590
you know, connected with your story.

404
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:02,050
Same way. And to have that influence, as you get older, you genuinely appreciate it.

405
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,690
We are a bit obsessed with collaboration in the leadership world, Stephanie. And I'll ask you

406
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,409
this question, final question. If you could collaborate with anyone on anything, and you've

407
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:16,469
done that so superbly in so many areas, you know, with Maggie Beer and the Kitchen Garden Foundation,

408
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,789
has there been one person you thought, wow, I'd love that to connect and collaborate with that

409
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,929
person anywhere in the world on any one of your passions?

410
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,289
I certainly, at the very, very beginning of the Kitchen Garden,

411
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:32,469
Foundation, I was extremely influenced by Alice Waters in Berkeley, California,

412
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:39,730
about she started a kitchen garden program called the Edible Schoolyard. But it was a different

413
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,289
model. But nonetheless, it did influence me. She took on a school that was very underprivileged

414
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:54,650
in Berkeley. And she created a model which still exists. But her model is different in the sense

415
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,289
that she wasn't trying to spread it into other schools. She wanted to create a model that was

416
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:03,650
not just a model. She wanted people to come and see a working kitchen garden, and then to decide

417
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,530
how they would like to apply it, if at all, in their own situation. Whereas right from the

418
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:15,949
beginning, I wanted our first school to just be a model, certainly, but I wanted to spread it into

419
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:22,309
other schools. I actually wanted the physical achievement of being able to say, this idea is

420
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:25,429
being carried forward. But she did influence me.

421
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,780
Collaboration. I mean, I'm very, very grateful to the organizations that have

422
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:41,800
helped us along the way, people like the Ian Potter Foundation. These things have been very

423
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,820
important at a certain time. I can't think of a single... I also have a wonderful CEO. And I think

424
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:56,400
as an organization, it's been very important for me to grow and say, my skills are not in governance.

425
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,719
And I've had... And I would...

426
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:06,500
I've been happy to pass over those skills to an effective board and a CEO. And I still am

427
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:17,400
important in spreading the image and spreading the flavor of the foundation to a possible new

428
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,260
prospect. Because as I say, we're always looking for people who will support us and allow us to

429
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,099
develop. And I love the words have come out so clearly in this conversation, the energy and the

430
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:29,679
enthusiasm.

431
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,619
And as you said before, it trumps everything in lots of ways. And I can still hear that

432
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,380
in everything that you say and your expansion. I can't wait to get a copy of Fresh. It'll be

433
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,579
another brilliant piece of work from Stephanie Alexander. Thank you for your incredible

434
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,980
contribution and leadership in all of our lives and in Australia and understanding food better,

435
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,420
understanding your passion for it. It's been a great privilege to spend some time with you.

436
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,719
Thank you.

437
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,960
Thank you, Luke. It's been lovely.
