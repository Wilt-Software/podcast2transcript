00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,169
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with an incredible

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:15,250
Australian, Tara Winkler. Tara's leadership in exposing the horrific outcomes for more than

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,010
8 million kids around the world who end up in orphanages or other institutions is a compelling

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,710
story to hear. Many of those children are actually, in fact, not orphans, but are removed

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,750
from extremely poor families and exploited. Tara's work in shining a light on this situation

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,670
has been a global shift in a positive way. Brilliant to hear how Tara, from just 19 years

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,850
of age, has dedicated her life to exposing how power, privilege and oppression intersect with

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,649
charity work. Her passion for igniting local wisdom, investing in preventative measures

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,229
and explaining that people living in abject poverty often don't lack the wherewithal,

10
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,810
just the resources, is an incredibly inspiring story. I'm sure you're going to enjoy this

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,729
conversation. It is people like Tara Winkler who inspire the work that we do.

00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:46,290
great team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand. We aim to give away more fantastic prizes.

21
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:52,129
Congratulations to our winner of the $9,000 Temper mattress. Sleeping on a Temper bed is

22
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:57,090
something that will change your life. We spend a third of our life asleep and people who have

23
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,370
success who just heard about and you hear more about Tara Winkler understand that sleeping well

24
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,009
allows you to live a sustained, successful life. And so investing in a Temper bed is a great way to

25
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,150
start doing that. Thanks again to Jason Nicholas and his team for their ongoing support of the

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:20,370
Empowering Leaders podcast. Tara Winkler is an extraordinary Australian humanitarian. In 2011,

27
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,509
she was recognised as the New South Wales Young Australian of the Year for her work in establishing

28
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:30,810
the Cambodian Children's Trust. Her inspirational TED talk on why we need to end the era of

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,729
orphanages has been viewed more than 1.2 million times. Tara Winkler is an extraordinary Australian

30
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:37,729
and helped to shine a powerful light on the plight of more than 8 million children around the globe

31
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:43,330
living in orphanage-like institutions. Tara's contribution as a child protection leader and

32
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,310
activist is a remarkable story. Tara, I've been looking forward to catching up with you. Thanks

33
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,930
for joining me today. Hi, Luke. Thanks for having me. Tara, your 19th birthday, your mum and dad

34
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,569
give you, as a birthday gift, I understand, a trip around Southeast Asia and you find your way

35
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,590
to Cambodia in what turns out to be a life-changing experience. Can you tell us

36
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,490
about the path that that set you on? Yeah, so I was 19, nearly 20 years ago now. I went travelling

37
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,990
around Southeast Asia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam. Last stop was Cambodia and I think like a lot of

38
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,669
people when they're travelling through countries in the global south, I felt uncomfortable being

39
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,569
on a holiday surrounded by so much poverty and just wanted to do something to give back while

40
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,969
I was there. So I went and visited some orphanages and just donated some clothes and books and toys

41
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,710
and things to try and help the kids that I met there. But one of the orphanages,

42
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:39,330
I visited on that trip, was desperately poor and I had never seen poverty like that before in my

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,469
life. There were kids there that were HIV positive that didn't have access to medical treatment and

44
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:47,169
they were just eating scraps from the monastery down the road, didn't have enough food to eat and

45
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:53,650
it was very confronting. So I felt compelled to do something more to help. So I fundraised in

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,509
Australia and then returned to Cambodia the following year to volunteer at the orphanage

47
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,650
for a few months. So I taught English and got all the kids to the dentist for the first time in

48
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:11,330
a year. And then over the course of the next year, I continued supporting the orphanage and

49
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,669
eventually came to discover that the director of the orphanage was very corrupt and had been

50
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,949
embezzling every cent donated to the orphanage. And in my absence, the kids were suffering such

51
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:26,949
gross neglect that they were forced to catch mice and things to feed themselves. I also found out

52
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,709
later that they were being subjected to physical and sexual abuse. And so I didn't feel like I

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,850
could just turn my back on kids who I'd come to know and care about and they begged me to help

54
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,490
get them out. I worked with a local team and the local authorities to set up a new orphanage. And

55
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,470
then on the 17th of August 2007, we turned up with a bus and rescued the kids out of that orphanage

56
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,009
and brought them to our new orphanage to give them a safe new home. So yeah, I was 19, 21 at

57
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,629
that point, very naive and suddenly responsible for 14 little people. But yeah, I mean, that's

58
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,370
sort of took another strange turn because it took me about six months to learn to speak

59
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,750
Khmer fluently. And then when I could communicate properly with the kids, they started telling me

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,430
about their families, that they weren't actually orphans at all, which came as quite a shock

61
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,129
because I just dedicated my whole life to set up this orphanage for kids who I thought had no one

62
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,790
in the world to love or care for them. It's an amazing trajectory. A lot of

63
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,269
people are moved by abject poverty and have that experience. Very few people

64
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,709
you have, which is this sense of, I'm going to go back and make a difference. As you said,

65
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,610
you're 21 years of age, you've suddenly got 14 children effectively that are relying on you

66
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,769
to support them. Where did you find that within yourself to push through and make a difference?

67
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:52,850
I grew up in a really socially conscious family with social justice being a big sort of driver.

68
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,449
My grandma was a Holocaust survivor. It was her and her sister that survived afterwards. So I

69
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,709
grew up hearing stories of what can happen when good people do nothing.

70
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,889
And so that was a big driving force when I got to Cambodia and met these kids. They were also

71
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,709
grandchildren of Holocaust survivors from the Khmer Rouge genocide. And so I guess that resonated

72
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:22,230
with me and I guess the intergenerational trauma from my family. And Tara, you found that when you

73
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,850
were able to speak fluent Khmer, which in itself is incredibly able to engage in that way, but

74
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,490
as you said, large percentages of these kids actually weren't orphans, that they had family

75
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,709
members that could have been orphans. And so I think that's a big driving force when I got to

76
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:32,750
Cambodia. So I think that's a big driving force when I got to Cambodia. And so I think that's a big

77
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:32,769
driving force when I got to Cambodia. And so I think that's a big driving force when I got to

78
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:38,389
care for them or still could. And you found also it's not just a Cambodian issue. This is a global

79
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,589
issue. Can you explain how that works and why these kids are being exploited in that way?

80
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,910
At first, I thought I just sort of stumbled across this isolated case, just this one bad orphanage

81
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,870
that was like operating like a business, like essentially removing children from their families

82
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,470
and using them as commodities to attract donations from tourists like me. But actually, it was

83
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,709
indicative of a much larger problem. There'd been, you know, there'd been a lot of people who were

84
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,550
a huge boom in the number of orphanages across many countries in the global south. In Cambodia,

85
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:15,649
between 2005 and 2010, the number of orphanages increased by 75%. And the number of children

86
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:21,329
being institutionalized doubled, despite the fact that 80% of the children living in those

87
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:27,189
orphanages are not actually orphans, but children from poor families. And even the remaining 20%,

88
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:32,509
who maybe had lost mom or dad, mostly have had other living relatives, grandparents,

89
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:38,490
aunties, uncles, who could have been caring for them with some support. I think the most shocking

90
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,750
thing of all to realize was what is actually fueling that boom in orphanages, because it was

91
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,449
us, the tourists, the volunteers, the donors, the well-meaning support from people like me,

92
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,829
who visit these children and volunteer and donate, who are unwittingly fueling an industry

93
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:01,889
that exploits children and tears families apart. So yeah, I mean, in the years,

94
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:10,370
since I tried my best to raise awareness about the harms of orphanages and what happens to

95
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,670
children when they're institutionalized, I did a TED Talk and published a book on it, and

96
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,370
Australian Story, 60 Minutes, and testified at the Parliamentary Inquiry into Modern Slavery,

97
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,949
which ended up being the first time in history that a government acknowledged that the movement

98
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,990
of children from families into orphanages is a form of trafficking and therefore a form of

99
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,690
modern-day slavery. But to say that it's not a form of modern slavery, it's a form of modern

100
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,350
slavery, despite all that, the problem persists. I realize that the only way we'll ever have any

101
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:45,590
hope of solving this orphanage crisis is if we address the root cause of it, which is the sort

102
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,909
of neocolonial, imperialist nature of the international charity sector.

103
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,009
And Tara, I want to talk to you about that and your campaign and your mission on that,

104
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,590
which is profound. Just going back a moment, I encourage everyone to have a listen to your TED

105
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,669
Talk if you haven't, because it's in 30 and a half minutes.

106
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,850
It does justice to what you uncovered and how you did. And I didn't always thought of orphanages

107
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,710
as a standalone thing that saved kids myself. I didn't understand. And then you listen to you and

108
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,129
you talk about other institutions, whether they be boarding houses or places where kids are removed

109
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,789
from their families. And the stats that you reel off are horrific, aren't they? 10 times more likely

110
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:30,690
kids that are brought up in institutions to fall into sex slavery, 40 times more likely to have a

111
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,669
criminal record, 500 more times more.

112
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,250
Likely to take their own lives. The data on it is just horrific. And when you remove kids from

113
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,529
families, did that form part of your change in what your work is to say, we have to close down

114
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,909
these institutions and family-based care is a big part of the way forward?

115
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,509
Absolutely. I mean, you just have to look at why we don't have orphanages in this country anymore.

116
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,710
We've known for over a hundred years what happens to children when they grow up in an institutional

117
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,149
setting. And like you just said, it has a huge impact on the trajectory of their lives. It also

118
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,570
is not the traditional way that...

119
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:09,529
Cambodia has ever dealt with problems of orphaned and vulnerable children. It's a Western-imposed

120
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:15,610
concept. Traditionally, orphaned and vulnerable children were cared for within a kinship care

121
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,870
environment with the sort of idea that the village raises the child, sort of community-based care

122
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,289
approach. And so essentially that's what we're trying to get back to. And I guess what it shines

123
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:32,330
a light on is the harms of Western-imposed...

124
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:41,049
When you think about it this way, you can imagine if a foreign-based organisation was in charge of

125
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:46,450
social services in Australia, or we're running the way that we educate our kids that are needy

126
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,830
and having issues, we would be appalled by it. We wouldn't allow it for a second. And yet that is

127
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,610
the model that the West imposes on third world countries and has done for years. And that's what

128
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,269
you're trying to point out, isn't it? That that is not the way forward.

129
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,669
That's exactly right. So if you think about it, it's not the way forward. It's the way forward.

130
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:10,750
Imagine if all of our social services, our public education and healthcare and social welfare was

131
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,850
controlled by private organisations in China or Japan or Nepal, whatever, Russia. It's a horrific

132
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,269
thought. And that is the role that international charities play in a country like Cambodia.

133
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,629
They create this privatised system of social support that runs in parallel to the local

134
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,669
public system. And then when we're in a country like Cambodia, we're in a position where we're

135
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,730
in control of this foreign privatised parallel system of social support. What we tend to do then

136
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:45,610
is invest downstream into what I call downstream development, which is sort of the ambulance at

137
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,169
the bottom of the cliff. And we do that because that tends to be what raises money, what pulls

138
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:56,070
on the heartstrings when we see people in crisis. People are then moved to give and to donate and

139
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:02,529
to help. But what that creates is this crisis-driven system where these communities are without any

140
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,870
dependable social protection system that would prevent them from ending up in crisis. So it's

141
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,950
kind of like build it and they will come. We end up with a very well-resourced crisis-driven system

142
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:20,110
where families have no choice. So a family living in abject poverty, there is no social support

143
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,070
services for them. But what there is, is orphanages. A lot of people will say to me,

144
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:29,169
like, how could a family, you know, I could never give up my child. How could a family do that? But

145
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,970
first of all, you have to understand that, like,

146
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,509
acknowledging back-breaking pressures of that kind of poverty. And they're really left with no

147
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:42,230
choice. And they believe it's going to be a path out of poverty to a better life.

148
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:50,389
What we know to be true is that the best way to create a healthy, flourishing society is through

149
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:56,350
a well-resourced public social protection system that raises the living standards for the whole

150
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,090
community, where they have access to high-quality public services, health care, education, housing,

151
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,669
and social support.

152
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,230
Which then prevent them from ending up in crisis in the first place.

153
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,649
I want to talk about your Village Hive project, which is extraordinary. And the data coming out

154
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:18,490
of it, from what you read, the reports from the Cambodian Children's Trust is a brilliant

155
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,169
concept and idea. I'll talk to you about it in a moment. I want to go back to the language you

156
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:28,610
use. This white saviour complex is a word I see that you reference, and that the white males often

157
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,570
in the West decide that we're going to go. And well-meaning at times, isn't it?

158
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,070
To save, you know, people in poverty. But you're saying that is never, ever going to be the

159
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,809
solution, and it just entrenches abject poverty, and we need to disrupt that in a way. And is that

160
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,929
something that philanthropic organisations have got to get their head around, that they have to

161
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,049
change the way they invest?

162
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,110
Yeah, look, I mean, I think if you look at the thing that we're trying to achieve,

163
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,429
it's empowerment. And this sort of system, this system of social support that we've created,

164
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:02,649
that charities create in a country like Cambodia,

165
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,009
this privatised parallel system that leaves communities totally dependent,

166
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:14,230
ongoing on aid and foreign investment, is the most disempowering system you can imagine. It's

167
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,990
paternalistic, it's patronising. And as I said, it goes against the very thing we're trying to

168
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,149
achieve, which is empowerment. Because contrary to popular belief, empowerment is not about

169
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:32,629
teaching a man to fish. Trust me, they know how to catch a fish. Empowerment is about power,

170
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,649
and who is in control and who is making the decisions. Yeah, one thing that I know to be

171
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:44,029
true after 15 years of living and working in Cambodia is that all of the knowledge and wisdom

172
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:50,669
required to solve complex social problems lives within local communities. What they lack is the

173
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:56,730
resources, not the wherewithal. And so having white people come in to build their houses,

174
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,669
dig their wells and save their children really goes against everything that we're trying to achieve.

175
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,629
And I love your language as well. Igniting local wisdom is a term I read a lot about in research

176
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:15,590
for this chat today with you, is that the answers remain within local communities. And as you said,

177
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,049
empowering them to have the resources to solve their challenges and doing that in a meaningful

178
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,509
way. And then having an exit strategy as well. I read that as well. You don't see the Cambodian

179
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:32,450
Children's Trust as the answer. You want to empower communities to then be resourced enough to sort out

180
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,629
the deep challenges that are there. Yeah, I really believe that the way that you can see

181
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:43,289
whether a charity is working upstream and invested in solving the root cause of problems and things

182
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:51,070
is with an exit strategy. It's like a great proclamation of their intent to solve problems

183
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,990
and not just perpetuate and capitalize on them. It's something that we really believe in at CCT.

184
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:02,669
That's been something that's sort of come out more recently in more recent years is basically,

185
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,470
realizing that if we ever want this work to be truly sustainable, like who better than the local

186
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,970
community to have a vested interest in their own prosperity? It's never going to be sustainable

187
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,629
if we're there implementing it for them forever. Quite early, obviously, we closed the orphanage

188
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,570
and began reuniting the children with their families and then started building prevention

189
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,470
and early intervention services to prevent kids from being separated from their families in the

190
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,870
first place. But we were delivering those services ourselves out of privately run

191
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,470
centers and things like that. And what we realized is that work will never be sustainable. And

192
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,029
actually, it was through the pandemic a lot. I was really worried that we would end up in some

193
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,629
sort of global financial crisis. And if all our funding dried up, then all of Northwest Cambodia

194
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:56,049
would be without social services. And it's a very precarious system. And that's part of the problem

195
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01,870
with this sort of privatized parallel system is there's no reliability for local communities. And

196
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,669
it's often dependent on the local community. And it's often dependent on the local community. And

197
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:06,849
it's often dependent on funding cycles and when funding starts and stops. For a while, there might

198
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:12,569
be some family planning services in a community, and then the funding ends, and then they go away.

199
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:19,589
It's a very precarious, unreliable system of social support. And so what we decided to do was,

200
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:27,250
it's basically a decolonization movement to take the programs that we have run and developed over

201
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,730
all these years in collaboration with the community through a process of co-creation

202
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,250
and hand that over through integrating that work into the public sector to create a public social

203
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,869
protection system that is wholly owned, run, and controlled by the local community. Once we've

204
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,130
finished handing that over, we can then exit that community, and they have a functioning

205
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,730
social protection system that raises the standard of living for the entire community.

206
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:54,890
I love the language that you use there, Tara. Co-creating, collaborating, igniting local wisdom.

207
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,470
Such a shift, isn't it, from coming in, and we've got the answers and the funds to solve your

208
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,710
problems. And it really does line up. And I think it's a very precarious system. And I think it's a

209
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,970
great leadership looks like, Tara, which is exactly that, collaborative. And we know the

210
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,289
research says if you co-create with the people that you're trying to get an outcome with,

211
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,569
that's what works, because it's part of what you're actually listening to the people that

212
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,829
you're effectively trying to work with. In whatever setting, yours is just such a profound

213
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:26,349
space, isn't it, where lives are saved and changed by these decisions. The Village Hive project that

214
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:30,730
came out of it, you've given a little bit of insight. It's a fantastic initiative. Can you

215
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,710
explain how it works?

216
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,869
How it works, the sort of nuts and bolts of it is we focus, instead of focusing the

217
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:43,569
predominant funding and everything on creating crisis services, which is in downstream model,

218
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,529
we invest most of our funding into prevention and early intervention. So that's public health and

219
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,089
public education, building up the public village health clinics and all of the public schools

220
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:00,029
in the community. And then once those basic public services are functioning and running at a high

221
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,710
quality, we introduce the public health clinics and all of the public schools in the community.

222
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,930
We also introduce an early intervention program, which takes vulnerable families who are at risk of

223
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:12,710
crisis through a process of self-determined change, where we initially would come in and

224
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,930
the social workers will do an assessment with the family and the family will work out what sort of

225
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,430
basic needs they're lacking. And then there's a support payment provided so that we know from

226
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,670
day one that the kids and family have access to all of their basic needs, health, education,

227
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,490
housing, all their identification documents.

228
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,210
And then they go on through a process of self-determined empowerment through literacy in

229
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,869
income generation and finance, go through a bunch of training. And then they develop a financial

230
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,009
goal, which is how much they need to sort of cover their basic needs. And then they'll go through a

231
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:55,049
sort of visioning process where they work out how they're going to reach that goal. And for a lot

232
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,809
of families, I mean, that might be employment. And for a lot of families, it'll be through setting up

233
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,690
a micro business. And then they're coached in how to write a business. And then they're coached in

234
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,369
a business plan and then establish that business. And then they go through a sort of cycle of

235
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:10,970
growing and developing that business until they reach their financial goal. And then they set up

236
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,630
a savings program, which is run through the community and family supporting each other

237
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,630
through community savings programs. And once they have meeting all their basic needs and have

238
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,289
reached that financial goal and have enough savings, they can exit the program and are

239
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:31,450
self-reliant. So it's a brilliant integrated model. And I can't help but think

240
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,809
I'm looking at someone who at 19 years of age went for a holiday. And I believe at the time,

241
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:41,970
you were a promising film maker and passionate about the film industry. Do you sit back and

242
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,890
think, I'm solving something that so many people around the world haven't been able to tackle? Do

243
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,230
you sort of see the sliding door moment and think, God, life could have been different? Do you reflect

244
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,250
on that at all? Yeah, I mean, it does feel like a lifetime ago. I just have always been someone to

245
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,309
go with the flow of life.

246
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,410
And it's just pushed me very clearly in one direction. And it's been tough. There's been a

247
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,470
lot of really tough, tough things that I've been through. But I'm also very grateful for the work

248
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,390
that I do. It's a privilege. Tara, I spoke to Peter Singer on this

249
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,549
podcast, the founder of The Life You Can Save. And he's a passionate advocate for effective

250
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:27,950
altruism. And he talks a lot about the, to paraphrase poorly, but the excess wealth in

251
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,829
the West and to distribute that back to...

252
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,549
To the third world countries. And he says, I'm not sitting here on this iPhone without us having

253
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:46,950
benefited from the low cost models that we have imposed on the West. And to give the maximum amount

254
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:53,230
of value in life and to have the most fulfillment is to share that excess wealth of the West. Is

255
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,470
that part of it? Do you think, Tara, that shifting mindset that just says, hey, we actually owe this

256
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,809
money back and we need to distribute it more evenly and fairly?

257
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,170
Yeah, I think there's a sort of narrative that we kind of grew up with, that we grew up in these

258
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:14,430
wealthy countries and where our country is wealthy of our own making. And these countries in the

259
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,269
global South are poor of their own making. But actually, if you look back through history,

260
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:27,390
200 years ago, poor countries were only two or three times poorer than rich countries. And then

261
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,589
after colonialism, they were 30 times poorer.

262
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,509
And now they're 80 times poorer. And so you really have to look at the way in which we have

263
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:45,410
developed is off the back of siphoning funds out of the global South. And it still happens today

264
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:53,470
through unequal trade and patents and tax havens and all the rest that $2 trillion flows from South

265
00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:01,690
to North every year. And we give back $130 billion, but still, it's unequal. And I think,

266
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:09,450
yeah, we have responsibility as citizens of the most privileged, wealthy countries on this nation

267
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,170
to create a fairer, more equal, more egalitarian world.

268
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:20,890
That's why your story is so incredibly inspiring, Tara, to dedicate your life to this message and

269
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,710
to do it in such a profound way and support so many people in the way that you do. I love sitting

270
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,769
down with people like you and different stories of leadership.

271
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,109
Passion, Tara, that shows up in different ways. We see these sort of common traits. I often use

272
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,410
the term that someone shared with us in this podcast, success leaves clues and why someone

273
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,869
like you has got the resilience to be able to, with all the challenges, and you've had some

274
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:48,970
serious challenges along the way, personal and also opening an orphanage and then working out

275
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,650
that you were actually part of the problem and having the courage to own that and to change

276
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,170
path and to describe it the way you did today. But we think it's very hard to lead someone else

277
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,490
without a sense of self-leadership. Tara, does that resonate with you?

278
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,990
How do you describe self-leadership?

279
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:11,869
I mean, introspection and self-reflection is a huge part of my life. And I guess that's,

280
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:16,890
I should say that as well, one major caveat when talking about leadership in my sector,

281
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,410
that I fundamentally believe that the time has long passed that we should be allowing

282
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:28,309
foreigners to lead development work in countries like Cambodia, because it's paternalistic and

283
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,910
patronising and disempowering.

284
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,170
And on that point, sorry, Tara, to interrupt, I believe 100% of the

285
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,410
Cambodian Children's Trust now are locals. Is that correct?

286
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:46,410
Yeah, absolutely. 100% locally staffed and locally led, and also now handing over all

287
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:51,910
the programs to the local community to control and run by themselves. So that's a really big,

288
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,450
and coming to that realisation took a lot of self-reflection and introspection and

289
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,269
navel-gazing to kind of, yeah, figure out that.

290
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,470
Been more than one mea culpa in my career.

291
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:10,890
Yeah. And when you think about that, I pick on that for a moment, isn't it? It's why it's so

292
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,930
powerful, your stories. And you wrote the book about why not to open orphanages. And your talk

293
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:23,150
was an experience, as you said, as a 19-year-old trying to be as well-meaning and positive as you

294
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,269
have been. I mean, have there been hard lessons to learn?

295
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,710
Yeah, definitely. Very jagged little pill to swallow. And sometimes,

296
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,970
difficult to have these conversations sometimes, I think, because these are really confronting

297
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,430
subjects. And you see yourself as a good person, and you're trying to do a good thing,

298
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,210
and then you're sort of aware of the fact that some of your unconscious beliefs may have been

299
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,829
harmful. They can be quite, yeah, destabilising, difficult things to hear. But that's why I've

300
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:57,170
sort of been such a proponent of kind of falling on my sword and admitting the mistakes that I made

301
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,390
and public mea culpas, so that...

302
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:08,450
Other people feel like they can be brave enough to kind of admit that they might have got it wrong

303
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,990
as well.

304
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,089
Which is a great example in itself, isn't it, Tara? A lot of people find that impossibly hard

305
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:17,269
to do, is to put their hand up and admit they don't have the answers or they got it wrong. And

306
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:23,930
it's such an empowering model to be able to be truthful and honest and understand that's part

307
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,089
of your own learning. And the same for all of us. Everyone has that experience. Another dimension

308
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,470
of leadership, and this almost feels like a question. I can't...

309
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,710
Because we think leaders are now really conscious of how they positively impact others on a daily

310
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,210
basis. And we think about it in our environments. That's your life, effectively, is positive impact

311
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,549
on other people. Have you thought about it in that way? When you wake up at the start of the day,

312
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,089
this is how I want to show up and have a positive impact?

313
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:55,009
I mean, I guess I've sort of led CCT through, you know, trying to role model

314
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:00,410
how I, you know, how we... And we try and do that through the whole organisation, like how we want

315
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,470
these social workers to be able to do that. And I think that's a really good question.

316
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,670
To work with families, we try and role model that all the way through the organisation. I'm really

317
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,470
a big believer in Simon Sinek's golden circle and starting with the why. And that's a really big

318
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,250
part of what's driven CCT is bringing everybody along on that journey and trying to make everyone

319
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,529
as passionate about why we're doing this as I am. And really focus. So we've had a lot of really

320
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:29,069
deep conversations about... Have you read Paulo Ferreira's Pedagogy of the Oppressed?

321
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,470
No, I haven't. But I'll read it.

322
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,150
I'll write that down. Yeah. Can you say that again, Paul?

323
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:39,890
Paulo Ferreira. He's a Brazilian philosopher and educator. And it was written in the 60s,

324
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,309
but it's as relevant today as ever. I recommend it for anyone who...

325
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:44,890
Pedagogy of the West, did you say?

326
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:45,869
Of the Oppressed.

327
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,910
Of the Oppressed, yeah.

328
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:53,329
Yeah. So he has a concept in that that he outlines called conscientisation, which is the process of

329
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:59,990
raising critical consciousness through intensive dialogue, or as he says, dialogical action, which

330
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,450
yeah, inspires people.

331
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,589
To kind of rise up and take action. And so we use that process and really focus on painting a really

332
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:13,710
clear North Star for everybody. And doing that is a really great way, I think, to give people the

333
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,849
freedom to achieve the mission and the aim in whichever way they see fit in a sort of

334
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:25,390
self-determined way. And it gives people then the freedom to kind of make mistakes and change

335
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:31,150
tact and the freedom to fail, which I think is hugely important if innovation is something that

336
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,910
you value. You've got to create an environment that's safe enough that people feel like they can

337
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,609
try and fail. And I try and role model that myself.

338
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:45,670
Yeah. Thanks for sharing that, Tara. And it leads, you spoke about creating a really clear North Star

339
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:52,390
and we see people who have the sustained success that you're having in your world are really clear

340
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,910
about how they create and share a vision. Yours is a powerful shift in the way we deal with

341
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,029
children and institutions around the country.

342
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,809
How have you gone about creating that vision and sharing it?

343
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:12,730
Yeah, well, through conscientization, like I said, and process of co-creation. So everything that we

344
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,950
do at CCT is co-created with the teams and the local wider communities and the families and the

345
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,309
kids themselves. It's not just my vision, but it's a vision that we've all kind of created

346
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:27,849
together. And then there's a lot of buy-in and ownership and accountability then for everybody

347
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,430
who's involved.

348
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,130
Thoughts on curiosity? We see people,

349
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,970
in these roles like yours, are really curious. And through that curiosity, that's how they

350
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,470
approach their learning and development, constantly wanting to improve. Does curiosity

351
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,730
play a role for you?

352
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:48,589
Yeah, hugely. I don't really have heroes in my life. I'm kind of an opponent to the idea of

353
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:52,869
heroes on the grounds that there's this sort of sense that heroes are off doing these impossibly

354
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,710
great things that the rest of us can't do and thereby kind of excuse us out of not doing

355
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,869
anything. I have been inspired hugely by,

356
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:07,509
thought leaders, Christopher Hitchens and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jason Hickel,

357
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,549
Paulo Ferreira. And not so much in kind of what they think, but in how they think and that they

358
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:18,490
are free thinkers and think for themselves and think outside the box. And so that's, yeah,

359
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,390
that's been a hugely inspirational part of my life.

360
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:27,930
Tara, we see people who understand their leadership communicating with great clarity. And you

361
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,130
have in so many great forums. I mentioned the TED Talk and you wrote a book about it.

362
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,470
Brilliant book. And you've told your story on 60 Minutes, an Australian story. And with great

363
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,950
clarity. Have you thought about your communication and the way that you've been able to tell your

364
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,210
story?

365
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:48,569
Yeah, I always, I try and kind of, especially in this, like when I'm crafting like the TED Talk

366
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:53,789
and my book and things, really try and join the dots together for everyone so that it's like,

367
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,390
because sometimes when you're in the sector and there's a lot of jargon and there's a lot of,

368
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,029
so I try and keep it.

369
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:07,509
It's like simple as possible. I actually, I actually went to NIDA and did a bootcamp in

370
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:12,349
public speaking because that was absolutely not something that came naturally to me at all. So

371
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:16,410
when they asked me to speak at TED, I contacted NIDA and they were kind enough to kind of put

372
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,650
me through a bootcamp, which changed my life, honestly. It was, yeah, one of the greatest

373
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,329
things I've ever done.

374
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,650
Oh, that's a great insight. I get the sense, Tara, talking to you that the joyful part for

375
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,910
you is being on the ground speaking, Kamara, and working with the kids and the work you do.

376
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,109
Yeah.

377
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,690
But it's still, get the sense that being the face of this movement and the Cambodian Children's

378
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,190
Trust is something that you have to work on, that it's not, you don't like, forget the sense,

379
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,170
you don't like talking about it in your role. And it is, how have you dealt with that?

380
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:51,750
Yeah. Yeah. I'm an introvert and not comfortable in front of a camera or a microphone. Like,

381
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:57,089
as I said, that's why I went off and did the course with NIDA. I was, yeah, very, very bad

382
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,829
at interviews and public speaking and everything, really. And I'm not being humble. I was,

383
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:09,069
just not born with that natural skill set. Yeah. I mean, I just have tried to do my best

384
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:13,569
because I guess I believe so much in what we're doing and more and more as the years go on and

385
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:19,109
CCT's mission has evolved and it's become about something, something bigger than just helping,

386
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:23,930
you know, a few kids and a few families in Northwest Cambodia, but really trying to shine

387
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:30,269
a light on what I see as massive problems in the international development sector. And that we do

388
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:36,430
have a novel way of solving it. And that could potentially have implications and ripple effect

389
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,569
around the world. And I really, I'm more passionate about what we're doing today than I

390
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:46,690
ever have been. And I guess I try and just speak from that place of passion and remember why it is

391
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,230
I'm doing it, even though, even though it's really hard. Yeah. The passion comes out. Can I just ask,

392
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,890
was there something you could pass on from the NIDA bootcamp on public speaking that,

393
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,210
that stayed with you? Honestly, so many things. I, I'm going to sound like I'm advertising,

394
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:06,849
but it was truly life-changing. Especially when you're doing a short speech, it's so much more

395
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:11,869
than a performance than it is a kind of a talk, a one hour keynote where you've got your slides

396
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:15,109
and you can click through and you know, your stuff and you'll get to your point eventually.

397
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:20,950
But for those shorter speeches, it's a, it's a performance and I, I am not a performer. And so

398
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:27,269
it was a lot of little things. Like I naturally talk pretty fast. And so they taught me how to

399
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:30,250
slow down and really focus on like, how was it? How was it? How was it? How was it? How was it?

400
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,869
The sentences and where the emphasis should lie and the inflection. And when you're doing that

401
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:38,869
and you're thinking about like each word and how you're going to articulate it and how you're going

402
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:45,849
to deliver that, that sentence, it suddenly, it sort of puts you in the moment and you don't have

403
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:51,089
that sort of brain mouth disconnection where you sort of get off and you say, what did I say? I

404
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:55,549
can't even remember. It's, I think it's almost a mindfulness technique to be honest. But it puts

405
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,910
you in the moment. It keeps you connected with what you're saying rather than letting your head

406
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,970
run away and have a whole separate conversation. That's brilliant. How important Tara has

407
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:09,510
collaboration been for you? Collaboration is the backbone of everything that we do. Local

408
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,190
collaboration that is. So that, and that was a real big challenge through COVID because everything

409
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:20,869
that we do is done in co-creation and collaboration with the wider community. That made it really

410
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,090
difficult to do through COVID with all the lockdowns and things. And that was a bit of a

411
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,210
hold up with our Village Hive project. And the total aim of that is to hand over the entire

412
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:37,630
Village Hive initiative to all of the 10 district, all of the 10 communes in Battambang district

413
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:44,190
and then exit ourselves after that. So we've now done the first, the first commune and

414
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:49,969
the second commune is underway this year. It's all done through collaboration with,

415
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:54,789
with the wider community. And potentially scale that around the globe. Is that an

416
00:34:55,090 --> 00:35:01,909
option? Well, look, I don't know. We'll see what happens. Basically we want to prove that

417
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:06,530
it's possible. Again, we've got some universities behind us building the evidence base for the,

418
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,150
for the model. Once we do it in Battambang district, then we'll have a case for the

419
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:16,510
Cambodian government to potentially scale that across Cambodia. And I mean, it really would

420
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,969
then be one of the first upstream, like prevention focused child protection systems in, in the world.

421
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,010
We don't have one here and it's, you know,

422
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,090
to me, it's crazy that we have a child protection system that waits till, you know, children are

423
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:35,630
harmed and in crisis before we intervene like that. That's not child protection, that's child

424
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,429
abuse. And most child protection systems in the world are like that. They're, they're reactionary

425
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:45,389
and they're not, there's not enough supports built around families to prevent kids from

426
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:50,309
ever needing to end up in out of home care. And this could be an answer to that.

427
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:54,989
Yeah. What an amazing thought and you know, the preventive method, as opposed to,

428
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:00,909
waiting for the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff is, it makes sense to, to hear you say it,

429
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:05,210
and I hope more strength to, to the work you're doing. Who's been the greatest leader in your

430
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,510
life, Tara? The greatest leader in my life. I'm going to say my co-founder,

431
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:17,329
Panjeta. He's truly the most remarkable leader. I've learned so much from him over the, these 15

432
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:23,630
years that we've been working together. He's just the most humble person and he truly, he truly

433
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,789
leads by inspiring.

434
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,969
The people around him, including me.

435
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,789
Is there a sense that he thought lots of people come over and say, I'm going to come back and

436
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,949
help and that he doubted whether or not that you would, would follow through initially? Did I

437
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:38,090
read that or was it immediately, you're going to build this together?

438
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,670
Well, that's the kids, the kids used to say that a lot, that there would, there was a lot of,

439
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,030
you know, tourists coming in and out of their lives and always promising to come back and,

440
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:53,530
you know, never doing it. I, I am really lucky. I'm really lucky to have connected with the people

441
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:59,190
that I did. The, the kids that I met initially and that they were huge, hugely inspiring for me

442
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,409
as well. Sunette Chan, who's my best friend. She was one of the oldest kids that we rescued out of

443
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:10,769
the orphanage. And we do a lot of the awareness raising together. I mean, she's also been a huge

444
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,889
inspiration to me through these years. Yeah.

445
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:19,050
In the spirit of, of collaboration and I love asking this question in the space you're in,

446
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,389
have you thought about it? If I could collaborate with that person or that organisation,

447
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:29,769
in any area of your life, Tara, but clearly what the work you're doing is the passion that jumps

448
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:35,309
out. Has there been someone that you've thought that would be an ideal boost to the work that

449
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:41,929
you're doing? Dream collaboration. I mean, honestly, anyone really, like all the, all the

450
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:46,869
dreamers and rebels and renegades and people who believe what we believe and willing to kind of

451
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:53,510
collaborate and help us make it possible, build a more fair, egalitarian world.

452
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,829
I'd welcome any collaboration because it is going to, it's, it's not something that we can do

453
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:03,269
alone. It's not, it's not a job for one person or one organisation. It's, it is going to take

454
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:10,789
an army of people to, to create systems change on that scale. So the more, the more, the merrier.

455
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:17,550
And I think sometimes we, we think that, you know, a job like that is kind of a utopian fantasy,

456
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:23,369
but, you know, if you think back through civilisation, all of the, the major changes

457
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:23,510
that we've had in the past, you know, we've had a lot of, you know, we've had a lot of

458
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:30,130
democracy, the end of slavery, vote for women, gay marriage, they all once upon a time seemed

459
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,530
like a utopian fantasy. So. Beautifully said. And you can make a

460
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:40,489
donation to the CCT, the Cambodian Children's Trust that was co-founded with Tara and the great

461
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:47,210
leader that she spoke of, and also the Village Hive project as well, which as you just heard

462
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,730
from Tara is an incredible programme that's unfolding and the initial reports I'm reading,

463
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,070
even post-COVID, which you thought might've been more challenging, it seems to be

464
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,590
working in exactly the way that, that you'd hoped. Tara, it's an incredible story. I've

465
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,949
enjoyed listening to it from afar, but I appreciate you sharing it with us

466
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,730
today and wish you all the best. Thanks for taking the time.

467
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:10,130
Thanks, Luke. It's great to speak to you.
