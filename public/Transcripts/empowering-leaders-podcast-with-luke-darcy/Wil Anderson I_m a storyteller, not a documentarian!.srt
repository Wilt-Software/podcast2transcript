1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:11,529
What I know to be true is that I think in comedy, you can still pretty much say whatever

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,050
you want.

3
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:18,929
I think in broader society, you can't necessarily say whatever you want anymore because humor

4
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,050
in those senses is contextual in all senses, right?

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,289
There are things that I would happily say within the confines of my standup show in

6
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,449
a room full of people who've been there all night.

7
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,950
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

8
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:38,609
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

9
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,929
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse

10
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,070
backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture, and the arts who come together to learn, to

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,070
connect, and to collaborate.

12
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,390
Kirsten King, founder of Fluid Form Pilates.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,729
It's been amazing.

14
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,049
Here you are on this Zoom call.

15
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:01,350
So, feeling within the first session like you intimately know these people and care

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,629
for them, and then all of a sudden realizing that even though you're in totally different

17
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:12,230
industries, we're all going through the same thing, or we've been through it and we can

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,510
help each other, or there's just this hurdle that you can't see past, and then you share

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,870
it with the group, and there's five answers in 40 minutes, and you think, I have not slept

20
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,790
for two weeks.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:25,989
Think about it.

22
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:26,030
Think about it.

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,709
Think about that.

24
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,430
Like, how is this possible?

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,829
Craig McRae, senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club.

26
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,909
You're listening to stories and the breadcrumbs of what makes success, and I constantly get

27
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,709
something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups, because we're all living the same stuff, aren't

28
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:41,829
we?

29
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,049
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience.

30
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,930
What happens there is magical.

31
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,810

41
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,789
Will Anderson is one of the most respected voices in the entertainment industry.

42
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,270
He's a world-famous comedian, a multiple-award-winning television host, internationally respected

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,770
comedian.

44
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,849
Will's ability to dissect complex issues, stop laughing at me, mate, with humour and

45
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,990
intelligence has seen him sell out shows around Australia and the world.

46
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,849
In 2008, Will became the executive producer and host of Gruen.

47
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,289
You've got to fact-check me here on a few things.

48
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,250
And one of the most successful shows in Australian television history.

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,189
He has several outstanding podcasts, The Brilliant Willosophy, Tofop, which is 30-odd foot of

50
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,349
pod, with his great mate, Charlie Clawson.

51
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:55,770
He's an author.

52
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,490
He's an author of three books, largely drawn from his brilliant writing, The Sunday Roast,

53
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,370
published in Sunday newspapers around Australia.

54
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:06,349
Co-hosted Triple J's Breakfast Show with Adam Spencer, The Glasshouse on the ABC, and in

55
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,449
recent times, The Brilliant Question Everything.

56
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,050
He's fresh from doing improv shows at the Comedy Festival.

57
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,490
He's a genius in every sense.

58
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,110
Great to see you, mate.

59
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,229
Mate, that was a lot of stuff.

60
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:16,729
Felt like a lot of stuff.

61
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,389
It's the most homework I've ever done.

62
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,330
Yeah, it was good.

63
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:19,750
Ever.

64
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,750
I mean, it's rare that anybody uses the term respected in regard to me or my career.

65
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,849
So that did make me giggle a little bit.

66
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,370
Do you know, as I was writing that, I thought, I know you're going to laugh, but you're a

67
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,349
hard man to sum up.

68
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,310
You're a hard man to capture in a paragraph.

69
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,370
Jack of all trades, master of none.

70
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,310
That's what it is.

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,229
Well, you're a country boy from Sale in Victoria, son of dairy farmers.

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,810
How young were you where you realised milking cows was not going to be your future?

73
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:48,430
Yeah.

74
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,770
So it's funny because I examine this theme so often, and often even in my work.

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,770
In fact, in my last year's show.

76
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,090
I think what was so legitimate was me going back to sort of the jokes that I would make

77
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,250
about growing up on a farm or about my dad and these sort of things when I first started

78
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,610
doing comedy through the eyes of somebody who is now the same age as my dad was when

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,669
I started doing comedy and whether I did see them differently.

80
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,230
So I really went back and had a good think about, talked to mum and dad about the idea

81
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,750
of, you know, when did you know that I wasn't going to be a farmer?

82
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,769
Were you very invested in the idea that I was going to be a farmer?

83
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,750
You know, in entertainment, they're always joking about the.

84
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,209
The idea of Nepo babies, you know, the next generation, you and I know you're from a

85
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,310
football family, generations of footballers, a bit of a family tradition.

86
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,350
Farming is a little bit like that in that often the next generation farmer comes because

87
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,430
their parents, you know, were involved in the farming industry in some way.

88
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,889
But my dad, despite the fact that he's been a farmer all his life and the fact that his

89
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,089
dad was a farmer, never really put any pressure on us, any of the kids.

90
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,769
This is a thing that, you know, I back for the Bulldogs in the AFL.

91
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,910
But my dad's a Geelong fan, everybody else in the family.

92
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:03,230
So his dad, James, and then all his kids and all their grandkids are Collingwood.

93
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,589
Every single one of them.

94
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,110
We were a Collingwood family.

95
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,430
The only exception to the Collingwood family was dad, who just decided he wanted to pick

96
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,870
his own team and barrack for Geelong.

97
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,170
When we were growing up, dad said the exact same thing to us.

98
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,029
He said, you don't have to barrack for Geelong.

99
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,250
You all get to pick your own team.

100
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,550
My brother barracks for Essendon and I barrack for, you know, for the Bulldogs.

101
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,870
My sister barracks for St Kilda.

102
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,769
You know, we all just chose a different team.

103
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:28,310
And it was a bit like that in the way that they raised us as kids.

104
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,870
There was all this, always this expectation that dad was a farmer from the age of 14 or

105
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,089
15 when he started farming because he wanted to be a farmer.

106
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,769
He moved down the road to his own farm and started that when he was 15.

107
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,389
He didn't take over the family farm.

108
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,069
He wanted to be on the land and build a farm and have this, this lifestyle.

109
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,189
And what our parents were very big on for us was that they wanted us to

110
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,889
have those same opportunities to pursue something that we also loved or had a passion for.

111
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,269
So my brother went back and eventually took over the family farm.

112
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,829
And I have talked to him about it because he went off and he was a builder and he lived

113
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:11,529
in London and traveled all over Europe with his friends and had that whole experience,

114
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,750
lived in Western Australia for a while, traveled around Australia.

115
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,529
But he did say that about every year dad would check in and sort of say,

116
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:19,689
how are you feeling?

117
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,449
Do you think that you might come back to the farm?

118
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,069
Never any pressure to do it.

119
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,110
But there was.

120
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,449
A yearly check-in to say, you know, cause I mean, obviously dad and mum built this great

121
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,310
big farm, like, yeah, well this, you know, family business, they were like, what, what

122
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,029
happens to it when we stopped doing it?

123
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,709
Um, those calls never came to me.

124
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:42,550
So I think, I think from both sides, it was a mutual agreement.

125
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,810
You know, like sometimes when people say things are in a mutual agreement and you're like,

126
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,129
that doesn't really feel like it was both sides.

127
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,350
I think this was one where we both knew that it wasn't going to be for either of us.

128
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,089
And I've met your brother and he looks like the son of a.

129
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:58,629
Um, and he's a great fella and, and it looks like potentially that was always going to

130
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,870
be the case, but do you look, but you must look back and think, geez, that's forward

131
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,250
thinking of your parents to be, cause a lot of parents struggle with that.

132
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,269
They just can't help, but see the world through their own vision and they want their own kids

133
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,509
to be like them.

134
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,329
That, that must've, you must be pretty respectful of that when you look back how accepting they

135
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:15,589
were.

136
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,350
I am.

137
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,990
I, you don't know that you have good parents until you meet people who haven't been as

138
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,250
lucky.

139
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,709
Cause when you have good parents, you assume that.

140
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,029
Yeah.

141
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,089
Yeah.

142
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:24,149
Yeah.

143
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:24,170
Yeah.

144
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,189
Yeah.

145
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:29,389
Your parents are good or you have the luxury of looking at the things that annoy you about

146
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,689
your parents and, you know, pretending like they're bad things.

147
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,870
Whereas when you grow up and you see the world and you see the great headstart, it can be

148
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,470
in life that my parents are humble parents.

149
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,670
Like, you know, not, not, nothing particularly flashy.

150
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,769
We weren't particularly well off, you know, they're farmers, they work for a living.

151
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,569
It's a small farm.

152
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,230
It's a family farm or that sort of thing.

153
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,410
But my, my mum had a thing that she used to say, which was like, as a parent, your responsibility

154
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,149
is to love your family.
