00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:08,470
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is an extraordinary individual.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,910
Zoe Kalar is the founder of We Are 8.

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:16,589
She is a serial success in the tech entrepreneur world and has achieved incredible things.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,449
One of the biggest issues facing us all, for me, are the algorithms of social media, what

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,489
they're doing to our young kids, the amount of time we're spending on our screens, the

6
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,190
divisiveness of the way that the world is unfolding through the world of social media.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,549
But how do we change it?

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,170
How do we put that genie back in the bottle?

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,409
Well, Zoe Kalar may well be the one person on the planet capable of finding a solution.

10
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,869
We Are 8 is an incredible innovation.

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,289
It's changing the world of advertising.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,170
You're going to hear Zoe talk about the hurdles she's overcome to be a successful female tech

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,490
entrepreneur, why she believes governments need to take a stronger stand against social

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,630
media platforms, and she's calling on brands to shift more of their money towards people

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,350
and the planet.

16
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,210
It's one of my favorite stories.

17
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,210
Zoe has a...

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,769
A vision, an energy, and an inspiring way about her that is truly unique.

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,650
We are incredibly privileged to collaborate with Zoe in our Elita Connect program.

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,290
We curate groups of five to six people from around the globe to come together to learn,

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,890
to share, and connect.

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,769
And it's people like Zoe who inspire the work that we do.

23
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,430
We'd love you to have a look at it.

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,409
Head to elitacollective.com and book a discovery call today.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,870
Big thank you to the team at Temper, Jason Nicholas and his team, great supporters of

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,409
conversations like this with Zoe.

27
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,870
We know that great leaders are united by the need for sleep and investing in a mattress

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,769
like Temper will be a decision that changes your life.

29
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,769
Zoe Collar is literally changing the world for good through her social media platform,

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,390
We Are 8.

31
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:53,069
We Are 8 is on track to disrupt the hundred plus billion dollars of annual advertising

32
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,230
money that flows directly to Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, putting that money back in our

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,010
hands as users, charities, and creators of positive content.

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,769
To give you an idea of the possibilities...

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,870
We Are 8 is on track to disrupt the hundred plus billion dollars of annual advertising

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,950
money that flows directly to Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, putting that money back in our

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,969
hands as users, charities, and creators.

38
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,330
When one percent of the population, 80 million people, watch two minutes of ad content a

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,490
week, We Are 8 will be putting more than a billion dollars a month back into the community

40
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,349
and charity.

41
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:20,530
On top of that, there is a zero hate on We Are 8 with sophisticated AI tech in place.

42
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:26,409
Pat Cummings, Australian cricket legend, Rio Ferdinand, Manchester United superstar, and

43
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,449
a roll call of some of the most influential and conscientious investors around the globe

44
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,889
are backing Zoe in her mission at We Are 8.

45
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,009
We Are 8 is on track to disrupt the hundred plus billion dollars of annual advertising

46
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:33,030
money that flows directly to Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, putting that money back in our

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,050
hands as users, charities, and creators.

48
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:52,469
Zoe's record of success in the media tech and startup world is a remarkable story in itself, selling her first media business back in 1997, successfully bringing Andrew Lloyd Webber's work to China and most recently creating and eventually selling Standard Media Index, a tech platform that transformed the advertising and media landscape in the US.

49
00:02:52,469 --> 00:03:02,650
Zoe, it is great to see, incredibly inspiring what you're doing. You know I'm a fanatic when it comes to sharing the way I write stories, so it's great to be able to do it in this format. Thanks for joining me.

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,569
Thanks Luke, it's just brilliant to be here.

51
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:26,090
I want to talk to you first from a mother's point of view, because our kids are growing up in this world of Instagram and Facebook and Snapchat and these platforms are irrefutably leading to teen suicides. There's a horrific spike in eating disorders and mental health epidemic really for our kids. Is that the reason why you're dedicating your life to this?

52
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:33,030
There's nothing surprising about starting this conversation with that question, Luke.

53
00:03:33,050 --> 00:04:02,050
Because, you know, you're all about getting to the heart and there's so many reasons why I've built this, but that is right at the heart. I mean, we have our kids living on social technology that is irrefutably damaging and kids spending four to six hours a day on average, which is three to four months of their lives a year on social media control.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,990
Wow.

55
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:31,230
Where the entire framework is built to control what we see, how we feel. And so for me, it was how can we reimagine a world that I want my kids to live in and I want my friends' kids to live in and I want my friends to live in and I want to live in where we're safe and we're free to be ourselves, our biggest, most inspired, inspiring version of ourselves,

56
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:38,689
without fear that someone masked is going to walk through the door and start abusing us.

57
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:57,230
And I think I just came hot off the discussion. There was a BBC three-hour conversation with some families that had gone through the tragic loss of their kids suiciding and I met one of them.

58
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,069
I really had to hold myself together.

59
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,209
A beautiful man.

60
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:30,490
A beautiful man, Ian Russell, that tragically lost his daughter, Molly Russell, to suicide. He's a really prominent voice here in the UK. It was the first case many years ago where the coroner cited social media as the key cause and at what point do we as leaders, as technologists, as mums, as dads, as people say, enough?

61
00:05:30,490 --> 00:06:00,470
This is just not okay. And it was really that. I couldn't bear the idea that my kids were having to live in this world with that being forced on them. And I couldn't see anyone else doing anything about it because everyone else thinks big tech is too difficult to change. And it is too difficult to change. But what's not too difficult is imagining a world past that, where we're shifting.

62
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:11,410
We've shifted the power of big tech back into the hands of the people, where people are safe to be themselves and where we don't have to live in fear of being abused every day.

63
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:30,449
And Zoe, I look back at Facebook was created by Mark Zuckerberg at college to judge women on their appearance. And when you think about where that has now led to and we now understand the damage that it's causing, it's like you're this perfect person that's come along with your media.

64
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:52,769
And your determination to just say, you know what, I'm not copying this. I'm going to, as you said, find a way. Does it feel like your life purpose has come to this point? And I know we're putting a lot of pressure on you, Zoe, to fix a problem that the world, I think now starting to understand just how bad this is. Does it feel like you've arrived at this time in your life or not?

65
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:59,769
Do you know, it's funny because I think it's been eight years and $57 million to build.

66
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:23,269
Build an architect, a solution that is the evolution, but it feels now we're at the starting line. So I think if it wasn't, if it didn't feel like my life purpose, I don't think I could have been resilient enough to keep going, honestly, Luke, at times, because it's really difficult for people to imagine a world post.

67
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:30,470
I mean, we look at Zuckerberg. I look at that an original thing, as you say, it was built to judge and literally rank.

68
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:57,649
Women to get dates. And if we think about it, Facebook's become a massive manifestation of judgment. So for things become a big manifestation of their original intention. And whilst for all the good Facebook does to connect us, because that part is beautiful, you know, they were on a mission to connect everyone in the world.

69
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:15,949
But unfortunately, because of the judgment and the lack of boundaries and protection and safeguards and economic models that valued people and everything else that was broken, it's now just become something massive that's incredibly damaging for people in society.

70
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:26,589
It definitely feels like a life purpose. It feels now like we've worked out how to build it. We've built it, the entire ecosystem.

71
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:53,009
And it's exciting now, because I can see, I can see it. And the people that are now part of it, it feels like the world is now seeing it. Things that I saw eight years ago were actually quite painful. You know, the climate, I remember where I was saying, Oh, my God, we've got 15 years until the damage we've done to the planet is irreversible.

72
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,149
We've got a world where kids now.

73
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:27,529
I'm feeling judged and in a mental health crisis. And it's just going to get worse. I know I'm here actually, to just build tech to navigate the way through that, that it just feels like my job. Beyond that, now I'm in the mode of, Oh, my God, what is possible, when we're actually, you can't be anonymous, when we're all safe to show up as ourselves, when there's an economic framework that pumps the money back to people and communities.

74
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:44,070
When we can come together around a common goal. I want to be at that party. If I got a push notification saying, Do you want to be one of 80 million people today that spends 30 seconds watching an ad, donates it to the water crisis, and we're going to build 30 wells in India right now. Like, yes, I want to be at that party. And then I want to feel and then I want to dance,

75
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,289
Luke, because I feel like I've given it away. Ninety seconds and then I want to dance, really. And that's awesome.

76
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,909
joy out the other side of being being able to do something good people are feeling hopeless

77
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:12,870
and not valued and that's just a completely shit way to to be yeah sign me up for that party uh

78
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,269
zoe and i i think there is a community we're gonna have a big one i'm looking forward to uh

79
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,350
to uh to catching up in person that's going to be uh be a lot of fun can you just explain to people

80
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,190
what you've built and how the way i rate model it seems like the impossible task you're taking

81
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,470
on these giants that have got money that almost incomprehensible to think 120 billion dollars of

82
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,470
revenue that actually doesn't even make sense to most of us to go to one company and effectively

83
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,350
half of that to one person how have you built tech that's going to challenge that i know wouldn't you

84
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:51,330
like to know what he is doing with all that money 135 billion dollars a year you have to think

85
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,230
wow for me

86
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:00,490
i had to see because the economic crisis climate crisis mental health crisis they're all interlinked

87
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:08,210
at a sort of macro level and and micro level but for me it's it i needed to break it down

88
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:16,389
into the chunks and work out how to do each piece and that if i look at the economic challenge in

89
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:22,629
itself when we look at the money i mean governments don't have enough money teachers aren't paid

90
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:23,090
enough

91
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,929
you know nurses aren't paid enough here in the uk we're seeing hospital workers go to food banks

92
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:36,470
once a week and eight million people out of a population of 60 not get enough food on the table

93
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:43,649
every day if we look at each thing and break down the economic crisis for example all i could see

94
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:52,889
how do we get more money into the hands of people and so for us if i look at the way facebook make

95
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:53,230
money

96
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,710
they make money by keeping us controlled and scrolling every day for as long as humanly

97
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:05,710
possible their goal is to keep us squished within that feed and never stop because then they can

98
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:13,769
just service more ads facebook make money from advertising from brands and 100 nearly 135

99
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:22,990
billion dollars last year and the crazy thing is their ad units only deliver 0.04 engagement rate

100
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,389
anyway so the ad unit doesn't even work people can i jump into that so before you finish because

101
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,990
can you explain that in real terms because it feels as though everyone has been conned that

102
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,950
spend your money on instagram that's where the audience is there's everyone is located there so

103
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,450
you need to to have your ad spend there but you you know this space better than anyone else because

104
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,789
you build an index to actually measure this so in terms of customer acquisition why is that number

105
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,970
so poor and why have we been conned by it can you can you give us a little bit of time to talk about that

106
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,149
a bit more on that look in the old days tv ads got a lot of attention and really worked i can

107
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:07,669
actually still sing jingles from the 70s luke but if you asked me any ad that i saw across digital

108
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:14,309
i actually can't even remember and our human brains have started to block it all out there

109
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:21,450
are a lot of people on instagram no question but our brains are not absorbing the information

110
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,590
if we hit

111
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:32,090
enough times then eventually and throw enough stuff out there some things are going to work

112
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,629
but that's like saying i'm getting these results it's working for me but i've never actually

113
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:45,110
imagined or seen what it could be in a better way and in our all our advertisers are getting

114
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:52,370
67 times more attention they're getting more engagement they're getting better transactional

115
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,970
results

116
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,009
and they're making feel people feel really good and loved you know our biggest complaint luke

117
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:05,409
from all our citizens is that they don't get enough ads people want eight minutes of ads on

118
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,830
eight a day because every time they get loved and and watch a brand ad money goes into their

119
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,509
eight wallet money goes to charities money goes to communities and money goes to the planet

120
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,090
and then you can pay a bill pay your spotify or pay it forward to a charity

121
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,970
and so who would you say is going to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to be the

122
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,490
one that's going to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to

123
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,509
be the one that's going to have the most impact on the world

124
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,289
that there's a world where people want to watch ads

125
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:35,049
and that's the first bit because we realized if we could build an ad unit that people want to watch

126
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,509
and money and is shared with them and we make positive impact together

127
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:44,009
then that's naturally going to work better for brands and i'm part of that again sorry to

128
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,549
interrupt zoe because i am really passionate about that i haven't seen an ad or absorbed an

129
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,970
ad for for maybe six or seven years because i don't watch free-to-air tv i watch live sport

130
00:14:52,990 --> 00:15:00,110
only i don't operate on those platforms because i'm in that bizarre uh era where i missed it and

131
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,350
now uh you know through a passion space of accounts but you can skip the ads you don't on

132
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,870
podcasts i skip ads that i don't want to listen to but then your app comes along and it's like

133
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,809
hey that's going to give me a credit direct into my wallet you've gone and got nike and ebay and

134
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:22,590
cadbury and nestle and heineken and so the big advertisers are getting it so i watch my ad on

135
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,730
for two minutes and then i answer a question at the end for and i know then that the credit comes

136
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:34,509
and i can donate that to someone or i can pay off my phone bill or my spotify account or so that's

137
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,129
the integrated system that you've worked isn't reverse engineering it so that people are wanting

138
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:44,210
to just to stay on and then the advertisers are actually getting people properly watching that's

139
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,090
part of the model isn't it yeah totally so it's real people because in digital advertising 50

140
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,490
of it is fraud when ads are

141
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,210
pinged out over the internet so so we eliminate fraud it's validated identity real people

142
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:05,610
we bring the brand and the people together if you think about it advertising is a 500 billion

143
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:11,809
dollar industry built on getting people's attention to then selling them something

144
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:20,389
and yet people have never been valued in the economic equation you know it's like trying to

145
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,309
bombard you

146
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,830
but if i came up to you and said luke i'd really love 30 seconds of your time if i dropped money

147
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:35,690
into your wallet donated to charity and donated to planet projects would you give me 30 seconds

148
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:47,929
please oh yeah okay zoe i will so it feels people human beings deserve because we're the target of

149
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:52,470
the ads surely we deserve to be respected and valued and we deserve to be valued and we deserve to be

150
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,450
grand

151
00:16:53,450 --> 00:17:03,950
am i somehow

152
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,009
i don't know what we know rachel tell me i don't know how to answer your question

153
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:17,490
that uh to the least of our knowledge is that it covers so many types of things and and interesting

154
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,529
things so it's the thing about deep Zielinger because today we have

155
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:21,890
people who want is

156
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:30,670
show went live the ad went live in app and then it was also across a lot of other premium.coms

157
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:37,130
and websites and the publishers then are healthy again and more of the money shared with them so

158
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,750
our vision is wherever you watch a golden eight ad whether it's in app or on any of the great

159
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,430
publishers that we want to help make healthy again money is dropping back into your wallet

160
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,730
and then you can feel really good pay your things make positive impact and so the whole

161
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:02,369
ad economic flow is transformed the old world is fraud broken we think we've got to be there

162
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:08,650
it kind of it doesn't really work now we've got a world where you can reach the people that you

163
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,890
want to reach make them feel really good and respected and it just works 67 times better than

164
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,250
all the other shit ones that i love

165
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,410
you

166
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,630
yeah people often say well just switch it off take it off your phone and tell your kids to do

167
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:29,230
that well that's just not reality because that's where their social connections are it's as you

168
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,730
said the great part is connecting the world and catching up with friends that you hadn't before

169
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,089
the evil has jumped in on top of it and those algorithms that are there to divide us are

170
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,970
creating more hate and more nastiness than we've ever experienced before so let's keep the good

171
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,250
stuff earn some money donate that and pass that on and create a

172
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,410
a

173
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,950
great community with all the same features except that you've turned off the hate and you've turned

174
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,250
off the ability to be fake on there and so that technology is available to mark zuckerberg and

175
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,009
facebook they could do that in a second but they choose not to as you say because they want to keep

176
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:07,309
you angry they want to keep you uh sending uh negative things out into the world because then

177
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:12,769
they can bombard you with more ads and so i love spreading this story though because it's it's the

178
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:17,390
modern issue that i think all of us you know you look at your own kids and you're like oh my god i'm

179
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,329
thankfully they're healthy but the biggest fight every day is still when i go upstairs in a minute

180
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:27,769
it's hey boys enough get off the phones get off the every family's facing that crisis and

181
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:34,250
and tragically some aren't surviving it and that's the thing right because if i look at

182
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:41,849
building one part of the solution at the time at a time fix the economic model build the ad unit

183
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:47,150
that gets money in people's pockets and you know if eight million million people in the uk

184
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,369
can't afford to buy a car they can't afford to buy a car they can't afford to buy a car they can't

185
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,309
get food another eight million people can watch one ad donate 20p to fair share which can get

186
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,349
another eight million people food so there's the economic solve and the buying engine then on top

187
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:08,769
of that we've wrapped around the social experience but what's really exciting about that we've built

188
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:16,309
that framework we've now built in it's like building a house luke the most the most critical

189
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,150
pieces the

190
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,890
foundation the plumbing the electricity infrastructure all those things that you

191
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:30,630
can't see are really expensive and really painful to do particularly when you're redesigning it

192
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:37,970
we've now built all of that so it's free from hate we've integrated recognition software so every

193
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:46,130
video image comment is scanned on the way through we've built ai we've actually had to retrain

194
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,910
machines loads of machines we've built a lot of machines we've built a lot of machines we've built

195
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,130
a lot of machines we've built a lot of machines we've built a lot of machines we've built a lot of

196
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:54,029
which took us six months longer than we thought because machines think that we all hate each other

197
00:20:54,029 --> 00:21:04,890
and just want money money and power and so we've retrained it to detect directed hate so now you

198
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,230
can't be anonymous an engine's there to protect you from the hate i love the joy that that comes

199
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,390
when you speak about that and and and you mentioned the sort of social divide and and the issues

200
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,069
that's creating in the u.s.

201
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,869
i think three members of the walmart family are worth the the entire wealth of the bottom 50

202
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:29,210
percent of america that's how ridiculous the the divide has got these big tech entrepreneurs are

203
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:36,029
worth 70 80 100 billion dollars and more and and and we've got you know the gross domestic product

204
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:41,589
of some small nations are less than their annual earnings imagine in a country like india to be

205
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:46,910
able to put money back into people's hands through an app and give back to community the way that

206
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:52,849
you're doing um is just so exciting the thing that i i'm i'm sort of baffled with so you're the most

207
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,690
bankable person i think i've ever met your history is everything you do turns to success you've made

208
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,930
money for people in all of your ventures i mentioned some of them in the introduction but

209
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,569
female tech entrepreneurs get excluded from the pool in ridiculous ways can you share with

210
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:13,390
the the frustration of that that everyone listening to this this is a cause you you

211
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,289
have to get behind either either use it or

212
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,170
find a way to to put some money behind it but there's still hurdles you've got to overcome that

213
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,710
are that are really challenging it's a great question and one that i ask myself almost on a

214
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:34,009
daily basis look what can i be doing better i mean look the data and i can't thank you enough

215
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:43,289
for the introduction to lev shevkin and tracy warren because she is a an absolute powerhouse

216
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,849
change maker she's just got government legislation through in the

217
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:54,369
u.s that is now means that all vcs have to report on female-led companies that they're

218
00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:01,990
investing in because the reality is female founders get 1.7 percent of all funding all vc

219
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:11,569
funding and so it's very very difficult to build something big i mean elon can send seven rockets

220
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:16,829
into space that crash and burn but people will still back because there'll be an eighth so

221
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:23,250
you have to have money i mean the ecosystem we've built is 57 million dollars and actually

222
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,990
anyone that sees the market size and everything we've built would say oh my god how have you done

223
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,509
it for that and the buying engine which honestly our version of facebook ad manager where all the

224
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:46,190
brands can buy through it uses ai it's going to transform media buying completely it's actually

225
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:54,509
a thermonuclear weapon in a good way but the reality is it's just i don't look like elon musk

226
00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:04,230
i don't look like mark zuckerberg i'm 55 and had a shit ton of experience seeing big problems

227
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,849
building technology putting together world-class teams getting people successful exits and i still

228
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,890
have to fight every day for it but but it's shifting and the reality is that i don't look like

229
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,730
the only way to and but i'm not prepared to just sit down and complain about it i just am getting

230
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,190
on with that because i also know what we've built is transformational it's working for the biggest

231
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:37,450
brands in the world and the world is waking up to and this is why i love india because modi took a

232
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,210
stand he banned tiktok all the other governments are suing the social networks they're talking

233
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,890
about it it's very simple it is damaging for society and it's damaging for the world and it's

234
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:56,450
it's fueling knowingly fueling teen suicide and self-harm it's knowingly making our societies i

235
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:05,730
would argue it's just dumbing everything down making people feel really not valued so just stop

236
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:13,650
just stop governments take a stand ban it because there's an evolution now but because that process

237
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,890
is too slow we've just got to get on with it

238
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:26,450
so it's a tough old road but with thanks to amazing women and men like you advocating and

239
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,730
getting in the trenches with us because i look at young girls that want to be engineers or reimagine

240
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:42,430
things and i i don't want it to be this path we need to be able to absolutely be free to imagine

241
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,890
the biggest things work out how to do it and we need to be able to absolutely be free to imagine

242
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,789
the biggest things work out how to do it and have the support to execute on it and i can't wait to

243
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:58,789
we are eight becomes a hundred billion dollar company and then we can pump i can personally

244
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:05,210
pump so much money back into founder you know female and diverse led teams all the things that

245
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:12,710
i want to make impact on using our tech but the status quo is broken there's this fragility and

246
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,890
massive civil unrest from an economic perspective that is so much more than just the economic

247
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,829
simply not sustainable and it's almost laughable that on a macro level we think

248
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:30,349
there is so much the economic divide doesn't work the greed from big tech doesn't work

249
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:38,529
our societies are self-harming and suiciding the mental health crisis is an epidemic the climate

250
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:45,809
is screaming for our help at what point do we say oh shit we better do something about

251
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:53,329
about this and tragically as a as a as a race i mean do we need to cut down the last tree to

252
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:57,809
sort of work out that the trees are important and it feels like we're at that point isn't it where

253
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:04,009
it's got as you said it's it's you cry if you didn't laugh because it's it's so damaging and

254
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:09,309
it's so in front of us and it's something we're all facing but you have what i love there's great

255
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:15,069
champions that are on your side who are getting behind you and who have led with their money and

256
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,890
with their profile as well and i think it's a really important thing to do and i think it's a

257
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,990
and their voices yeah can you share with uh with us some of the people that are really backing what

258
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:29,730
you're doing so for a start well you luke you're fabulous really low level but i'm trying

259
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:39,910
do you know i think it's been a really fascinating process actually because i believe you know there

260
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:46,650
is inherent good in most people and there's enormous support now from our community we're

261
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:54,609
1.6 million people in app everything we're doing is really getting huge support from

262
00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:02,190
from the people you know at which is beautiful that means more to me than anything apart from

263
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,869
which the complaint about we want more ads so we need to stand together and call on brands to shift

264
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:14,769
more of their money back to people in the planet but incredible people i mean artists like shepherd

265
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,569
fairy who actually

266
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:25,890
he created the obama hope image you know right at the forefront of change we've got ushers and

267
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:34,630
investor rio ferdinand who you know he led manchester united to victory he's a great leader

268
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:44,569
and that the sport music we've got this incredible francisco nunez he's a conductor in new york city

269
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:46,890
he's put together this most beautiful

270
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:56,730
diverse choir of 2 000 kids from every borough every race religion gender and they literally

271
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:03,049
sing in harmony he believes he was put on this earth to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony

272
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:11,789
which the optimist that i am i believe we as human beings around the world can come together

273
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:15,630
see what we have in common not what divides us

274
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:24,930
so inspired every day and these incredible people you know patricia arquette actress huge change maker

275
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:33,269
the super vet who is um he he does 200 operations on animals that no one in the world world does

276
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:39,130
but now communities saying all these organizations that want their kids

277
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:46,210
on safe platforms that want to live on safe platforms but it comes talking about safety

278
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:54,930
isn't very sexy so we've built all the safe plumbing now let's be cool as with a heartbeat

279
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:05,130
and that and that's the stage where we are right now let's be you know let's be rebels and

280
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:15,450
change makers and shake shit up together because now we can be free to do that but you just you

281
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,329
just can't be

282
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:23,609
um don't be don't throw hate like that's enough of that exists in the old world

283
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:29,210
yeah beautifully said and it is inspiring and unfortunately has permeated all of our lives

284
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,150
sewer is out there of twitter and social media and it's created a language that i think a

285
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,569
generation of growing up and thinking that's actually part of the way you converse i see

286
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:43,369
it in the football industry here in australia that that i love it's this beautiful community

287
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,250
but now we interact in ways that are

288
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:52,650
are terrible when we want to sack people and we i find it really hard to listen to this thing

289
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,329
that's this great community game that that's permeated that part of the world as well and

290
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:02,789
it feels as though people have trained to to sort of be louder and and and have a hot take or

291
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,650
something that's a bit with an edge that doesn't necessarily um you know create this positive

292
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,089
positivity and so i love we need to share these there's so many great stories out there are people

293
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:16,289
all around the planet doing brilliant things that aren't getting a platform because they're not

294
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:21,230
being shared and we need to share more of them and it's been also brilliant so to collaborate

295
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,549
with you and a passion space that we talk about here a lot around a leader connect as well and to

296
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:33,329
have uh you and um andy walsh who's got an amazing story with his work that he's doing at liminal and

297
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:40,150
and and with red bull and the high performance um andy cohen who's a beautiful incredible uh

298
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,849
human being is um one of the most successful finance people in the world with jp morgan

299
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:46,069
rio

300
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:46,269
first

301
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:46,289
first

302
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:51,950
is obviously a great supporter of yours jude bolton is one of my favorite people in the world

303
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,549
of afl so again it's sort of our way of connecting people for good too zoe and it feels like it's when

304
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:03,089
we're so wrapped to be able to um have you in that space as well do you know it's funny luke

305
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:10,029
because firstly it's an incredible experience and i can't thank you enough i realized since

306
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:16,269
the age of 21 it's the first time you know when you're always pushing to build and to

307
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:22,529
and spending money on tech and the best team and everyone else you actually i realized that i'd never

308
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:29,789
actually done anything for myself um you know i put a lot of people around me to coach me and

309
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:38,869
help learn but just a group that i felt really safe with and as you say andy andy jude rio

310
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:46,250
stacy moderating i mean we're talking about incredible people i learn so much about people

311
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:53,809
on those calls i can't even begin to tell you and they make me feel i've never had it actually

312
00:32:53,809 --> 00:33:01,170
i realize i've never had that before so and neither has rio actually when you when you used

313
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:06,309
to the sort of the hotbed of coaching and then you move into the next stage of your life i mean

314
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,970
i look at rio and just think all of that greatness is just practice for what he's about to do

315
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,230
because i actually see him on the world stage representing the voices of 200

316
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:22,930
million people when we go into governments and big companies and drive for change in the world

317
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:30,829
like i see him as a representative voice of the 200 million people on aid saying this is what we

318
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:37,630
can do and so i believe it's really helping him i know it's helping him i know it's amazing i feel

319
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:46,049
like i'm in hot house learning mode and and you know i think we've had technology

320
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:54,230
that's sort of shaped our society but we haven't had leaders that say no so i think part of the

321
00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:00,089
thing with instagram it's well everyone else is showing up there i've got to be there everyone

322
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:06,349
else is there that's where i've got to be and then everyone follows and i think what's exciting now

323
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:12,630
we're seeing people that are there was a there were eight celebs in the u.s that just came out

324
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,210
and said we're saying no to social media and we're saying no to social media and we're saying no to

325
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:21,409
social and i think there's never been an alternative so and we haven't been quite ready

326
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,969
honestly like our tech everything hasn't been ready but we're ready now and what we're seeing

327
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:34,349
we're switching on at the end of the month a love count and comment count because all our talent

328
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:41,349
are getting more loves and comments than they are on instagram despite us having a lot less audience

329
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:46,110
it's the brave leaders and when you talk about the abuse

330
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:55,969
that teams are getting we see abuse in politics abuse in sport abuse that i mean 20 years ago

331
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:02,690
it never would have been acceptable and it feels like we've just like a frog in a pot of boiling

332
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,610
water you know it's just become acceptable and now the norm until there's a group of us that say

333
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,409
this is actually shit for everyone there's a much better way

334
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,670
i love it zoe and i i'm going to tell this story and i know um the person i mentioned will be

335
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:27,070
comfortable with it because i actually spoke to him about it last week um luke hodge is a four-time

336
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,110
premiership legend in our space one of the greatest players that has has played the game

337
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:37,050
he grew up in uh western districts uh from you know the old school country stock you don't meet

338
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:44,190
a more resilient and brilliant person and he did his first commentary game with me and like your

339
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,210
first day your first day at school and you know i'm not going to lie to you i'm not going to lie to you

340
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:52,610
um and at halftime he went to check on his kids just to see where they were and he got on his

341
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,969
phone and then i remember after halftime his face was sort of a bit ashen and he didn't really speak

342
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:02,030
in the second half you know which calling the game and i remember checking him after said you're okay

343
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,110
and he said no i'm not actually he said look i jumped onto my social media account and here's

344
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,010
what people said about me at halftime and i read some of the comments i could not believe you know

345
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,789
you are a fucking you know the dumbest fuckwit that's ever

346
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,570
called again and i was thinking if luke hodge with all that resilience and all that success

347
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:28,389
and one of the toughest and if he can get affected by that what hope does a 15 year old girl at

348
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:34,889
school have or a young person in a teenage brain trying to grow up like it just sort of hit me in

349
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:40,309
the face and i was like this is what we're dealing with like it's so evil and it's so pervasive that

350
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,710
no one's safe from that and as you said now we have a choice you've created a choice check out

351
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,769
if you haven't seen it before it's brilliant it's uh something that we just all have to

352
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:55,389
find a way and it's where our kids can still connect and still communicate and and it's where

353
00:36:55,389 --> 00:37:00,110
the world's shifting to whether we like it or not so i want to ask you these questions because

354
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,949
we have used this term a lot someone said it to me in this podcast success leaves clues and we feel

355
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:09,829
like there's these great patterns around why people like you are capable of doing extraordinary

356
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:15,369
things and we love the idea of of leadership and start with self-leadership and it's we feel like

357
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,030
unless you have a sense of your own self-leadership what does that mean to you

358
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:27,510
clarity i think it's something that i've always been working on so it's clarity of where you're

359
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:36,909
going and for me it's i've always been really good at the big picture vision then for me it's

360
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:43,869
breaking it down into really bite-sized chunks so that everyone around you whether it's tech

361
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,210
product any commercial or any kind of commercial or any kind of commercial or any kind of commercial

362
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:55,190
cfo funding they can actually come on the journey with you so leadership firstly inspiration

363
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:03,730
being really clear um you know you're in the trenches every single day choosing this path

364
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:13,250
for all my sins luke this is where i have been for my entire life but but i know i'm meant to be

365
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,070
here so it's staying inspired bringing

366
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,809
everyone up reconnecting them with the big big vision breaking it down so it doesn't feel

367
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:28,869
overwhelming celebrating the proof points which again i could be better at i work on these things

368
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:36,110
every day as stacy said in one of our sessions it was a beautiful comment listen to understand

369
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:43,469
i actually said to everyone i'm gonna get tattooed i think on my arm because i know i need to be

370
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,550
better at that listen to understand

371
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:58,809
so you know i i think it is showing by example every day i mean it's just resilience belief

372
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:07,130
and knowing and exceptional actually just just the standard you walk past is the standard you

373
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:13,750
accept and i'm not prepared to sit on the sidelines with any of it i love you know the way you speak

374
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,070
about that i'm not surprised because every time i

375
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,289
you know i've spoken to you i you i feel that energy and i feel inspired uh by uh by the way

376
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:25,989
that you are we see people really conscious on a daily basis this almost sounds like a ridiculous

377
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:30,829
question to ask you because your project's going to change the world but we see people focused on

378
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:34,730
the impact they have every day in their environment everyone they interact with and they're

379
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,210
sophisticated about that positive impact on others is that something you're conscious of

380
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:45,329
i'm one of those people that ends up and some people probably wouldn't believe this but i

381
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:54,110
overanalyze self all the time i mean i i remember when um you know when my mom i grew up in a really

382
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:02,349
working class area and you know mom and dad both worked dad was a doctor mom was a nurse you know

383
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:08,929
the shopping it was you know i remember being at the supermarket and her holding items back

384
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:15,349
before going through did we have enough money to have everything we wanted i remember

385
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:23,630
feeling i'm high high empathy so i'd feel the pain and i just wanted to take that away i didn't

386
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,829
want her to feel like that i could feel the it was really really intense for me as a kid and i

387
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:37,530
could feel it all around me when it was too strong i used to hold my breath because i couldn't and

388
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,949
mom would say darling you've got to breathe you've got because i just couldn't if i saw someone doing

389
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,150
something really

390
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:53,190
abusive or anything i just couldn't i i absorbed it so i had to learn to stop it so i think

391
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:00,829
for me there's a real i just want to help i want to do things for others and i think

392
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:08,150
if we all did a little bit for others god we'd live in a beautiful society you know i think if

393
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:16,110
if we started caring for each other and speak to each other and listen to understand which i

394
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:24,469
work on every day um but it's it's we need to care for each other more you know i hear those comments

395
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:33,449
that your beautiful uh commentating colleague went through and i just think no one should have

396
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:41,030
to go through that like that hearing that puts fire in my belly like you have no idea like it

397
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,969
it is not okay and we just need to so yes and

398
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,550
how good it feels when we start to care for each other that's where the joy is you know that's

399
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,030
that's right right the highest form of living isn't it when you are contributing and what and

400
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:02,530
what you're doing at that level is quite remarkable we're fascinated about how people go about creating

401
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:10,250
and sharing a vision this this is a massive vision that's a game changer for the planet i loved how

402
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,409
you said you break things down into bite-sized pieces but how do you go about you know sharing

403
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,170
your vision that's as big as we are right do you know a funny thing i was thinking i found a book

404
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:29,469
that i had when my son was 19 who's 19 now when he i was pregnant with him and i wrote down what

405
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:36,030
what's my life's purpose like what what is it and it just kept coming back to this line

406
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:45,730
i am on this planet to inspire empower and enable a billion people to make positive impact every day

407
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:54,170
and i and in this book are all the ideas where did that come from that was just a bubble that

408
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:01,630
came in into your brain yeah that's it yeah and i just read an article about professor sacks

409
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:09,010
it was in the new york time or new york something about the one percent and the one percent have

410
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:15,510
enough money to solve every problem in the world and i just i wrote him professor sacks a letter

411
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,210
at the time and i wrote him a letter and i wrote him a letter and i wrote him a letter and i wrote

412
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:22,489
which he never responded to by the way and it was i agree with you absolutely one percent have

413
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:27,369
enough power to solve all the big problems the reality is they're not going to do it

414
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:38,030
so what it's going to take is the people uniting to come together so i then i actually thought

415
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:43,510
even back then 19 years ago how do i make it fun and easy

416
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,510
for a billion people

417
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:50,230
to make positive impact every day because if we can make it fun and easy

418
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:57,989
then that's what's going to make us all feel really good and so i think it started way back

419
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:05,650
then and there were all sorts of game ideas and other things and then it was actually the layers

420
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:12,269
of the exciting part is now that we have the economic model solved and the buying engine

421
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:15,789
now that we have the social media free from hate and everything else

422
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:26,090
now the icing is the game using our technology now we can play the game on how inspiring and

423
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:32,710
creative can we be to just we've got all the bits now we're just coming together and

424
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:39,289
and doing amazing stuff every day so i think i haven't heard you say that before but to have that

425
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:46,190
before you know that was pre-facebook pre-instagram and so now what i love about it is that that that's

426
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,230
Those pathways are there.

427
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:48,489
We've all got them on our phone.

428
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,469
We're used to scrolling.

429
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:52,809
We can connect a billion people now, which we couldn't 19 years ago

430
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:54,429
when you didn't understand.

431
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,750
It's just a matter of – and they talk about, you know, addiction.

432
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,250
You've just got to create a different pathway for that.

433
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,710
But it's got to be fun and it's got to be equally creating

434
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,610
that same dopamine.

435
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:07,409
You've done it.

436
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:08,010
It's there.

437
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,570
It's just now getting people to delete one and transfer over to the other

438
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,949
and it sounds simple, but that's the mission, isn't it?

439
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,530
It's possible now to have a billion people doing this.

440
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,130
It's genuinely –

441
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,329
Right, and you don't have to delete.

442
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:25,389
Facebook connected a billion people on the planet,

443
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,730
and for that I'm hugely grateful because now while that's happening,

444
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,190
we can inspire them, empower them to make positive impact every day

445
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,030
over here where they feel valued.

446
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,690
And so I couldn't have done this without that actually.

447
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:42,869
And put money back into the community, put money back into people's hands

448
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,909
and share that wealth that the 1% – we're never going

449
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:45,929
to get rid of it.

450
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,429
We're never going to give up, as you described.

451
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,909
It's an amazing vision and it's there.

452
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,949
That's the incredible part is that you're on the cusp.

453
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,550
But we use the word curiosity a lot and we hear it come up a lot,

454
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,590
that people who achieve extraordinary things like you have done

455
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,690
right throughout your life, they're really curious.

456
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:03,809
And through that curiosity, they're constantly learning

457
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:05,349
and developing themselves.

458
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,389
Does that ring true for you?

459
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:09,429
Yeah, I think all of us learn.

460
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:15,329
I mean, and I get reminded every day my beautiful partner says to me,

461
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:18,530
oh, so what have we learned today?

462
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:22,949
You know, and it's – and actually we talk about it in the morning.

463
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:26,230
I really now consciously start each day.

464
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,050
I'm going to show up and do my best.

465
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:31,909
But that's what keeps life really exciting,

466
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,630
particularly when you're navigating a new path.

467
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,230
You know, you've got a vision, you've got the building blocks,

468
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:39,250
you've got all the bits.

469
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:40,789
That's life.

470
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,610
That's the life joy.

471
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,869
What am I going to learn every day?

472
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:45,750
Because even the day after, you know, you're going to be able to do a lot.

473
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:45,769
You're going to be able to do a lot.

474
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:45,809
You're going to be able to do a lot.

475
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:45,909
You're going to be able to do a lot.

476
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:49,469
Even the difficult stuff, even the painful stuff,

477
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:51,829
that's the best actually.

478
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:57,449
It's so true and I'm really grateful to learn from some

479
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,710
of the most incredible people.

480
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,730
And this is why a leader and what you've put together,

481
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:08,969
it's not just a normal group dynamic, that the way you've structured it

482
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:13,570
and the way you put people together and because of who you and Matt are,

483
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,550
it feels safe.

484
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,809
And there feels trust at the core, Luke, unlike anything else.

485
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,670
And that is very, very rare.

486
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:26,969
I know for all the people that are part of our group, it's really rare

487
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:32,449
because if you can fast-track the trust, then you can and that you're not going

488
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:39,389
to feel like an idiot if you ask stupid questions or show up in vulnerable ways.

489
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,349
That's really the only way.

490
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:43,710
Very kind of you to say.

491
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:44,289
You can learn.

492
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:45,150
And it feels.

493
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:50,130
My cap up to hear that because we love that idea of inspiring these connections

494
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,329
of people that would never have got together normally that share

495
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,909
that common good and it is a community of people that all the things

496
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,869
that you're talking about want to show up and want to be

497
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:00,670
in each other's corner.

498
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,670
And as you said.

499
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:08,750
Luke, do you know I was thinking, imagine, I just, I know I've talked

500
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,190
about this briefly, but a leader, groups of eight in a, I mean,

501
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,349
imagine when we've got 100 million people.

502
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:21,210
And with your framework, we can literally be groups of eight in a,

503
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,829
where we're actually learning together.

504
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:31,050
Imagine when we have someone from Israel, Palestine, Ukraine, Russia.

505
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,929
I mean, we need to start talking again.

506
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:38,809
We need to start talking again in environment of safety and trust.

507
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:41,269
I mean, I think you're a leader.

508
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:45,170
Groups of eight inside eight could be.

509
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,170
Amazing.

510
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,789
Yeah, we love that idea of being able to zoom out from your day-to-day

511
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:53,989
and spend an hour and 15, you know, and the tech's there, isn't it?

512
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,409
We can do what you and I are doing and you're in the UK and I'm in Melbourne today.

513
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:02,869
And we've now been given these tools that have probably gone off in a direction

514
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,789
we never hoped they would, but if you use them for good,

515
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:08,789
the possibilities is extraordinary.

516
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:12,969
And, you know, we're so inspired by what you're doing and how you're going about it.

517
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:15,150
And as we said, any form of collaboration,

518
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,650
collaboration with where our eight is right in our wheelhouse.

519
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,730
The other dimension I wanted to speak to you about was this idea of communicating with

520
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:28,550
clarity and we see people who achieve what you are consistently have got a really clear

521
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,309
why they communicate as you have.

522
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:37,030
Is that something that you've thought about or is it just evolved?

523
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,110
It's funny.

524
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,170
I have to work on it really hard because I see it as one of my weaknesses, actually.

525
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,170
Yeah.

526
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,170
Yeah.

527
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:49,150
And something I've had to strengthen.

528
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:56,090
So I look at each of my exec team, I've worked with my chief technology officer for a long

529
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:04,789
time so we can work in shorthand and I literally, I can say something, he gets it completely.

530
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:09,829
He maps it out, comes back to me, we tweak and then frame it out.

531
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:14,650
Other people on those calls, I have no idea what either of you were talking about.

532
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:25,110
So the funny thing is it's something that I really work on, particularly when we're reimagining

533
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,550
things that theoretically can't be done.

534
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:34,949
I mean, someone at one of the big media companies said to me the other day, you've reimagined

535
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:41,989
digital advertising in a way that works better, is more cost efficient, delivers scale and

536
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:43,469
values people and publishers.

537
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:44,469
Yeah.

538
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:52,130
We've been trying to do that and there has been no, we haven't worked out how to do it.

539
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:57,829
On one side, that's good, but communicating that along the way has been really difficult.

540
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:06,610
So communicating big things that are complex underneath, validated identity, centralized

541
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:13,929
wallet, ads where you get paid, social that's free from hate, all of those things, we've

542
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:14,929
got to work on that.

543
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:15,929
I think there are many, many things at the bottom that of us can't do.

544
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:16,929
A lot of us feel like we're working on the right thing.

545
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:17,929
And then there's the other thing that has just been very small, which is that we're

546
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:18,929
building up the space to the extent that we can.

547
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:19,929
So when we have a conversation with one of our clients, we're building up the space to

548
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:20,929
make sure that they follow along, we're building up the space to the extent that we can work

549
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:21,929
on the right thing.

550
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:22,929
And that's what I think is important is to get the information out and the conversation

551
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:23,929
is still going, but we've got to work on it.

552
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:24,929
So the learning off of the words has become very important for most people here.

553
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:25,929
And then there are more people in the world that want to go through what we call the

554
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:26,929
virtual space, which is the part of it that's very, very important.

555
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:34,769
learn all of that but just come and see the real me from 20 absolutely amazing people

556
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:41,809
is more exciting and clearer to the public you speak to i know families of of people and people

557
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:48,489
in our world that are living this sort of online life that is not even remotely close to who they

558
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:54,829
are and the and and the chaos and it's you know so long as it looks okay on instagram that is

559
00:51:54,829 --> 00:52:00,489
supposed to be a modern version of living and really below that is just a lot of despair and

560
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:05,809
tragedy and pain you know and that's the same if you all of us we're all trying to be as close as

561
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:11,449
we can to our ourselves and and when you are that's as joyful as it gets isn't it when you're

562
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:16,550
putting on the mask it's and and unfortunately again that world's created second version of

563
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:22,550
ourselves that um you know is impossible to really live up to so again i love uh i love how you've

564
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,789
been able to uh solve that issue and give

565
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:29,469
people an opportunity without hate because you can't you know you've created the platform you

566
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:34,769
get booted off if you hate on we are right you've got to be yourself i can show that you're not a

567
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:39,349
robot you're not someone that's uh you know that's not real so i love it how important has

568
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:46,750
collaboration been for you though in all your success it's everything actually you can't first

569
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:54,630
you can't build something big without other people building it with you

570
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:01,570
really exceptional people building it with you so it's everything both with my exec team with all

571
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:09,409
our partners with all our media partners with our publishers with talent with people it's everything

572
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:15,489
and i've learned a lot about collaboration because i think one of the things is funny is all those

573
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:23,170
areas that we learn about with the elita process i feel like i'm in 101 other people would say

574
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,809
yes there's amazing

575
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:29,929
collaboration or there's amazing whatever i feel like i'm at the starting line which is a beautiful

576
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:34,929
thing to feel safe enough i can feel at the starting line because then everything feels

577
00:53:34,929 --> 00:53:42,710
fast-tracked but collaboration is critical for the world we've built technology that is enabling

578
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:50,730
collaboration at a whole new level because there isn't any collaboration being exhibited people

579
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,809
young people now just cancel if they don't like something there's no

580
00:53:54,809 --> 00:54:05,570
space to grow and so we've got to relearn that and re-teach it in a framework that supports that

581
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:11,369
and so collaboration is critical to me as a leader collaboration is critical to the world

582
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:19,190
if we're going to get through increasing crises on every level so i spoke to uh tim copper on this

583
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:24,429
podcast not long ago and that's a astronaut who's building the new international space station can

584
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:24,789
you believe that and i think it's a really important thing to do and i think it's a really

585
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:31,289
even incredible guy and he was referencing that collaboration in space simply happened because

586
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:38,210
a russian cosmonaut and an american astronaut just became great friends and we're fascinated

587
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:44,710
and curious by the different ways each program did back in the in the space race era and they

588
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,690
just we're going to be much better if we just share and do this together and you still get

589
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,909
that collaboration now you know russian america collaborating today and sharing the international

590
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:54,769
space station

591
00:54:54,809 --> 00:55:02,170
so we can do it in space we just haven't mastered doing it on earth and and as weird as that sounds

592
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,869
as you said that at the global level that is where it all starts isn't it is one person to

593
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:12,809
another person reaching out or two leaders crossing that divide that is causing all of

594
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:18,949
the war and and tragedy that we're seeing at the moment it's uh it's fascinating i love that story

595
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:24,570
by the way because what those people what those astronauts did they put normal

596
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:35,110
earthly value stuff control greed none of that mattered because they were just both curious

597
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:42,170
about something beyond themselves and so none of this other stuff mattered it's that's a beautiful

598
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:49,909
story if we can all put the other stuff aside and just focus on something beyond ourselves

599
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:54,050
then we've got a beautiful world so who's been the greatest leader in your life

600
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,769
i have

601
00:55:54,809 --> 00:56:02,730
have many I think you know at times I mean I as a young girl I would look at

602
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:12,730
people like Bill Gates I always felt even as a young girl at university I actually always knew

603
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:20,130
that Bill Gates would be on my board actually that was just a and I and so I always admired

604
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:28,050
that I think sometimes the closer that you get the big tech leaders I used to admire massively

605
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:34,389
the big media leaders I mean don't hold this against me but I used to really admire and study

606
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:41,309
Rupert Murdoch actually the thing that made me sad the more I grew and the more companies I built

607
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:49,949
is the is the success that they had but the power and control and greed

608
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:50,110
and the power and control and greed

609
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:58,170
that i saw as the common thread in all of them so so even though i was inspired massively by what

610
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:04,969
they were able to do and achieve and by what someone like gates is saying about the world

611
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:14,250
but the inability to let go of the control um some of that stuff makes me sad the closer i get

612
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:20,170
to it which is a fascinating answer and i'm i'm so curious about that because there's a genius

613
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:26,090
behind the scale and and rupert murdoch's business story is one of the most remarkable in in human

614
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:33,650
history and and what's been able to for a inherited an adelaide uh newspaper and and that was it it's

615
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,969
not as though he was gifted the keys to people think that even though he's second generation but

616
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:44,050
to have the control of the u.s media and to be able to do what he's done fascinating to

617
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:44,230
understand

618
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:49,409
how he achieved that as you said it's the byproduct of it that maybe in the end everyone

619
00:57:49,409 --> 00:57:54,289
gets a little bit uh way late about it probably it leads into we're a bit obsessed with collaboration

620
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:58,010
in in the space that we're passionate about a leader and creating this world of collaboration

621
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:02,289
and i suppose ask that question you're collaborating with incredible people is there

622
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:07,429
is there one that springs to mind you think god if i could just you know and you mentioned two

623
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:12,630
historical figures there is it one person that in your world you think about that would be great to

624
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,170
collaborate with

625
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:22,929
there's many and actually i see the eight as a force of collaboration i see you know people coming

626
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:29,869
together to collaborate with each other in our framework i've actually imagined two heads inside

627
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:37,489
the eights you know people that you would never imagine collaborating collaborating i i a vice

628
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:43,750
president al gore i mean we've got the the climate reality project on eight which is his foundation

629
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,230
which is very important to me and i think it's a very important thing to do and i think it's a very

630
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:53,750
exciting their ceo is incredible um what david blood has done with the generation fund uh so he

631
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:59,190
has partnered with al gore to create a really big fund focused on a lot of climate things

632
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:07,449
he's a phenomenal leader who i know very well actually um and is driving transformation

633
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:13,530
in capital structures and that gives me hope for the world in in

634
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:19,210
in a different way completely different from a older me who's a former man i think i think

635
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,429
it needs to be a lot more well yesterday's talk was quite different from today i think

636
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:27,550
i would really love to collaborate with and his work and also the work of lloyd suarez who's

637
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,949
with us is quite a bit off but i think that really does add to it but perhaps you of all

638
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:33,989
these people who are in insurance are also sessioners who offer these very similar ways

639
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:38,869
to what we're proposing i think he's doing it in the world of capital flow and we're doing it

640
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:43,369
at capital flow for the people so i would i would love to collaborate with uh david blood and and foram

641
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:43,590
and vice president el gore if you're listening to this um on a on a deeper level but um i hope to be

642
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,090
who's one of our investors too, I hope that we are the framework

643
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,610
by which global leaders can collaborate again.

644
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,269
People can collaborate with each other and there's

645
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:59,710
an economic framework and a healthy society,

646
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:04,389
non-abusive framework that we can all collaborate

647
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:10,710
and listen, actively listen to understand each other again.

648
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:16,730
And we might walk away from the table not agreeing, but that's okay.

649
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,750
I might have come a little bit further to understanding your side

650
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,489
and you might have come a little bit further.

651
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,949
Even so, we can live at the table harmoniously.

652
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:29,809
And I don't want to diminish the intensity of what people have had

653
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:34,750
to endure or the injustice that they have had to endure or see,

654
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,150
but somehow we're on this little blue dot at the same time

655
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,690
and we're on this little blue dot at the same time

656
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:40,710
and we're on this little blue dot at the same time.

657
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,750
And there's enough resources for all of us.

658
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,630
We need to look after each other again.

659
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:47,969
What a beautiful note to finish on.

660
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,130
It makes me feel positive about the world talking to you

661
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,130
and that someone has come up with a solution to bring people

662
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,409
back to the table, as you said.

663
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:00,070
It used to be the great thing at a dinner table that you would learn

664
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,210
from someone else and you could have very opposing views

665
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,769
of the world or politics, but you'd learn from each other

666
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:08,409
and it feels like we've lost that art that now we want

667
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:10,690
to cancel each other or we...

668
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,190
We want to bear arms because someone's red and someone's blue

669
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,929
and it's got crazy to the point where, as you said,

670
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,329
it's beyond laughable and I just love every bit

671
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,590
of what We Are 8 stands for.

672
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,230
It's incredible that you're the person that's out in front

673
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,389
but collaborating with these incredible people around the globe.

674
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,570
So more strength to you, Zoe, in everything that you do.

675
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:34,789
Couldn't be more passionate about it and I've been looking forward

676
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:36,230
to telling the story today.

677
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:37,409
So thanks again for sharing it.

678
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,449
Thanks, Luke.

679
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:40,590
Thank you for all your support and everything.

680
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,250
Thank you for everything that you're doing.

681
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,710
I think this is...

682
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,570
Our collaboration is the start of something really great.

683
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,070
